This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you,  our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our private contractor will soon install a new sewer main in S. Paxton Avenue, from E. 69th  Street to E. 67th Street, in E. 67th Street, from S. Merrill Avenue to S. Crandon Avenue, and in E.  70th Street, from S. Paxton Avenue to S. Oglesby Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1913, and  needs to be replaced. In addition, our contractor will make a connection between the sewer pipe  in S. Crandon Avenue (between E. 70th Place and E. 71st Street) and the sewer pipe in E. 71st  Street.     We are coordinating with Alderman Hairston’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Leslie Hairston   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            5th Ward           Do you wonder what was happening in 1913? That’s the year the old sewer main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                  ROSA PARKS        Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States.    Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in Sheffield, England.    The Ford Motor company introduced the first moving assembly line.    The first prize was inserted into a Cracker Jack box.    Gideon Sundback patented the zipper.    The Panama Canal opened.    Civil rights activist Rosa Parks was born in Tuskegee, Alabama.                            PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management’s private contractor will soon install a new  sewer main S. Paxton Avenue, from E. 69th Street to E. 67th Street, in E. 67th Street, from S.  Merrill Avenue to S. Crandon Avenue, and in E. 70th Street, from S. Paxton Avenue to S.  Oglesby Avenue.  Further, our contractor will make a connection between the sewer pipe in S.  Crandon Avenue (between E. 70th Place and E. 71st Street) and the sewer pipe in E. 71st Street.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1913 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by 67th  Street on the north, 71st Street on the south, Oglesby on the east, and Merrill on the west will  benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.       Timing:  Installation of the new sewer main will begin in early July, and we expect the work to  be done in late November.  This includes restoration of the damaged streets/parkways.  Dates  may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will  notify you.    Traffic:   When the new sewer pipe is being installed in Paxton and 70th Street, we will have  closures to “through traffic”.     When work is being done in 67th Street, for approximately 3 weeks (August 30, 2013 –  September 21, 2013), eastbound traffic on 67th Street, Merrill to Crandon, will be closed to  “through traffic”. Traffic will be detoured from Jeffery Boulevard east to Marquette Road south  on South Shore Drive to 67th Street. Westbound traffic on 67th Street will remain open.     While the connection is being made between the sewers in Crandon and 71st Street, the  contractor will maintain one lane for westbound traffic on 71st Street.    You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in  place. Safety is our first consideration.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.        CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN LESLIE HAIRSTON   773-324-5555      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                     FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.       Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Hairston, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

Lopez, M.D.   President    DePaul Center, 2nd Fl.  333 South State Street  Chicago, Illinois 60604  (312) 747-9428  (312) 747-1031 (Fax)   http://cityofchicago.org/health    Members:  Carl C. Bell, M.D.  Adele Joy Cobbs, M.D.  Melanie Dreher, RN, PhD.  Caswell A. Evans, Jr., DDS, MPH  Victor M. Gonzalez  Steven Rothschild, M.D.  Horace E. Smith, M.D.  Joseph B. Starshak           An Open Letter to Chicago Aldermen       November 19, 2013    Dear Aldermen:    The Chicago Board of Health enthusiastically applauds Mayor Rahm  Emanuel’s proposal to balance the budget and reduce tobacco use among  Chicago youth by increasing Chicago’s tobacco excise tax by 75 cents per  pack.  We call on Chicago’s Alderman to support this proposal.    Tobacco taxes save money and save lives.    This tax increase makes sense and the Chicago City Council should approve  it.  Increasing the price of tobacco is the single most effective way to  keep kids from picking up the habit in the first place.  Tobacco taxes  also help the government reduce and offset the substantial economic and  health burdens it bears because of smoking.    Just a ten percent increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes reduces youth  consumption by six to seven percent, and overall consumption by  approximately four percent. This decrease translates to fewer children who  take up smoking — saving them from a lifelong deadly addiction — and  more adults who quit smoking.      Tobacco use remains the leading cause of premature death in Chicago,  killing thousands of Chicagoans every year.  For each tobacco-related death,  more than 20 other people struggle with one or more serious tobacco-related  illnesses, including lung, oral, and pharyngeal cancer; many other forms of  cancer; heart disease; stroke; asthma; bronchitis; emphysema; and at higher  risk of pre-term and low birth weight.      The threat of a black market cannot justify inaction.    The underground trade of any dangerous and addictive product — whether  it be heroin or tobacco — is always a serious concern. Yet, the threat of a  black market cannot justify inaction.      There is very little evidence to support tobacco industry claims that a 75- cent increase in the price of cigarettes would lead to a massive expansion of  the existing underground trade for cigarettes.  However, there are a variety  of policy options that can be used to disrupt the underground trade of  cigarettes.          One important initiative that could address the black market would be for the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) to finally implement the national track-and-trace system required by the Family  Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009.  Mayor Emanuel strongly supported this  legislation as a member of Congress, and President Obama signed it into law.      A national track-and-trace system would monitor the manufacture and flow of tobacco products from  production through distribution to retail outlets.  Similar measures to control the supply chain have  been successful in disrupting the black market in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.1  A national  track-and-trace system would also generate much needed tax revenue.  Most importantly, by ensuring  retailers and other are not able to evade tobacco taxes, a national track-and-trace system will decrease  smoking among the most price-sensitive consumers — our children.    Some of the most trusted names in public health and medicine are calling for implementation of the  statutorily-required, national track-and-trace system — including the American Cancer Society,  American Heart Association, American Lung Association, American Legacy Foundation, and  Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids.    If the tobacco industry is serious about reducing black market sales of tobacco products, it should urge  the FDA to establish a track-and-trace system.      Chicago’s Aldermen should join Mayor Emanuel in strongly advocating for a national track-and-trace  system, which would immediately disrupt the black market.  In addition, Chicago’s Aldermen could  explore a wide variety of local policy solutions.  For example: (1) require all retailers with a tobacco  license to post signs that provide citizens information on how to identify legal versus smuggled  cigarettes and how to report illegal sales; (2) encourage the reporting of smuggling activities and  protect witnesses by providing whistleblower protections to employees who notify authorities about  wrong doing or testify in court; (3) require wholesalers to use only tamper-resistant invoices (similar to  prescription pads used by doctors) to ensure tobacco retailers are not tampering with invoices in an  effort to evade consumer protection inspections and taxes; and (4) enhance authentication and  verification of tax stamps with digital tax stamps, using anti-counterfeit taggant (i.e., microscopic)  technologies rather than physical tax stamps.    The Chicago Board of Health urges you to put the health of our children above the financial interests  of Big Tobacco companies.  Pass a 75-cent, per pack, tobacco tax increase.
