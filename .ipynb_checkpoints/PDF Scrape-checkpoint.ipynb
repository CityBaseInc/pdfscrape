For the latest \\ninformation about any future developments \\nrelated to Form W-4, such as legislation \\nenacted after it was published, go to \\nwww.irs.gov/FormW4.\\nPurpose. Complete Form W-4 so that your \\nemployer can withhold the correct federal \\nincome tax from your pay. Consider \\ncompleting a new Form W-4 each year and \\nwhen your personal or financial situation \\nchanges.\\nExemption from withholding. You may \\nclaim exemption from withholding for 2018 \\nif both of the following apply.\\n• For 2017 you had a right to a refund of all \\nfederal income tax withheld because you \\nhad no tax liability, and\\n• For 2018 you expect a refund of all \\nfederal income tax withheld because you \\nexpect to have no tax liability.\\nIf you’re exempt, complete only lines 1, 2, \\n3, 4, and 7 and sign the form to validate it. \\nYour exemption for 2018 expires February \\n15, 2019. See Pub. 505, Tax Withholding \\nand Estimated Tax, to learn more about \\nwhether you qualify for exemption from \\nwithholding.\\nGeneral Instructions\\nIf you aren’t exempt, follow the rest of \\nthese instructions to determine the number \\nof withholding allowances you should claim \\nfor withholding for 2018 and any additional \\namount of tax to have withheld. For regular \\nwages, withholding must be based on \\nallowances you claimed and may not be a \\nflat amount or percentage of wages.\\nYou can also use the calculator at \\n\\nwww.irs.gov/W4App to determine your \\ntax withholding more accurately. Consider\\n\\nusing this calculator if you have a more \\ncomplicated tax situation, such as if you \\nhave a working spouse, more than one job, \\nor a large amount of nonwage income \\noutside of your job.  After your Form W-4 \\ntakes effect, you can also use this \\ncalculator to see how the amount of tax \\nyou’re having withheld compares to your \\nprojected total tax for 2018. If you use the \\ncalculator, you don’t need to complete any \\nof the worksheets for Form W-4.\\n\\nNote that if you have too much tax \\n\\nwithheld, you will receive a refund when you \\nfile your tax return. If you have too little tax \\nwithheld, you will owe tax when you file your \\ntax return, and you might owe a penalty.\\nFilers with multiple jobs or working \\nspouses. If you have more than one job at \\na time, or if you’re married and your \\nspouse is also working, read all of the \\ninstructions including the instructions for \\nthe Two-Earners/Multiple Jobs Worksheet \\nbefore beginning. \\nNonwage income. If you have a large \\namount of nonwage income, such as \\ninterest or dividends, consider making \\nestimated tax payments using Form 1040-\\nES, Estimated Tax for Individuals. \\nOtherwise, you might owe additional tax. \\nOr, you can use the Deductions, \\nAdjustments, and Other Income Worksheet \\non page 3 or the calculator at www.irs.gov/\\nW4App to make sure you have enough tax \\nwithheld from your paycheck. If you have \\npension or annuity income, see Pub. 505 or \\nuse the calculator at www.irs.gov/W4App \\nto find out if you should adjust your \\nwithholding on Form W-4 or W-4P. \\nNonresident alien. If you’re a nonresident \\nalien, see Notice 1392, Supplemental Form \\nW-4 Instructions for Nonresident Aliens, \\nbefore completing this form.\\n\\nSpecific Instructions\\nPersonal Allowances Worksheet\\nComplete this worksheet on page 3 first to \\ndetermine the number of withholding \\nallowances to claim.\\nLine C. Head of household please note: \\nGenerally, you can claim head of \\nhousehold filing status on your tax return \\nonly if you’re unmarried and pay more than \\n50% of the costs of keeping up a home for \\nyourself and a qualifying individual. See \\nPub. 501 for more information about filing \\nstatus.\\nLine E. Child tax credit. When you file \\nyour tax return, you might be eligible to \\nclaim a credit for each of your qualifying \\nchildren. To qualify, the child must be \\nunder age 17 as of December 31 and must \\nbe your dependent who lives with you for \\nmore than half the year. To learn more \\nabout this credit, see Pub. 972, Child Tax \\nCredit. To reduce the tax withheld from \\nyour pay by taking this credit into account, \\nfollow the instructions on line E of the \\nworksheet. On the worksheet you will be \\nasked about your total income. For this \\npurpose, total income includes all of your \\nwages and other income, including income \\nearned by a spouse, during the year.\\nLine F. Credit for other dependents. \\nWhen you file your tax return, you might be \\neligible to claim a credit for each of your \\ndependents that don’t qualify for the child \\ntax credit, such as any dependent children \\nage 17 and older. To learn more about this \\ncredit, see Pub. 505. To reduce the tax \\nwithheld from your pay by taking this credit \\ninto account, follow the instructions on line \\nF of the worksheet.

For \\nexample, if you earn $60,000 per year and \\nyour spouse earns $20,000, you should \\ncomplete the worksheets to determine \\nwhat to enter on lines 5 and 6 of your Form \\nW-4, and your spouse should enter zero \\n(“-0-”) on lines 5 and 6 of his or her Form \\nW-4.

If \\nyou choose this option, then each spouse \\nshould fill out the Personal Allowances \\nWorksheet and check the “Married, but \\nwithhold at higher Single rate” box on Form \\nW-4, but only one spouse should claim any \\nallowances for credits or fill out the \\nDeductions, Adjustments, and Additional \\nIncome Worksheet.\\nInstructions for Employer\\nEmployees, do not complete box 8, 9, or \\n10.
