(To  Ordinance)   Central  West  Redevelopment  Fhoject  Area.   Tax  Increment  Financing  District   Eligibility  Study,  Redevelopment  Plan  And  Fhoject.   October  26,  1999.   (Revised  October  29,  1999j  (Revised  January  18,  2000j   Executive  Summary.   In May,  1999, S. B. Friedman fit Company was engaged by the City ofChicago  (the  ""City"")  to  conduct  a  Tax  Increment  Financing  EUgibffity  Study  and  prepare  a  Redevelopment  Plan and Project  (the ""Redevelopment  Plan"").  This report details  the  eUgibility  factors  found  within  the  Central  West  Redevelopment  Project  Area  (the  ""R.P.A."") Tax Increment  Financing  (""T.I.F."")  District in support  ofits  designation  as   2 / 1 6 / 2 0 00   REPORTS  OF  COMMITTEES   2 5 2 81   a  ""conservation  area"" within  the  definitions  set  forth  in  the  Illinois Tax  Increment  Allocation Redevelopment Act, 65 ILCS 5/11-74.4-1, et seq., as amended  (the ""Act"").  This  report  also  contains  the  Redevelopment  Plan  and  Project  for the  Central  West  R.P.A.   The Central West R.P.A. is located within  the near west  side community  area  and  consists  of two thousand  ninety-four  (2,094)  tax parcels  on  one  hundred  ten  (110)  blocks  and  contains  approximately  four  hundred  sixty-three  (463)  acres  of  land.   Determination  Of  EligibUity.   This report concludes that the Central West R.P.A. is eligible for T.I.F.  designation  as a ""conservation  area"" because fifty percent  (50%) or more ofthe  structures  in  the  area have an age of thirty-five  (35) years or more and because the foUowing eligibiUty  factors  have  been  found  to be  present  to  a  major  extent:   depreciation  of physical  maintenance;   deterioration;   structures  below minimum  code;   inadequate  utilities;  and   deleterious  land-use  or  layout.   Additionally,  two  (2)  other  eligibUity  factors  are  present  to  a  minor  extent  and  demonstrate  that  the  Central  West  R.P.A.  is  in  a  state  of gradual  decUne  through  disinvestment.  Left unchecked,  these conditions could accelerate  the decline  ofthe  community  and,  combined  with  those  factors  that  have  been  documented  to  be  present  intensive  disinvestment.  These  factors  are:   to  a  major  extent,  could   lead   to  more  widespread  and   obsolescence;  and   excessive  vacancies.   25296   JOURNAL-CITYCOUNCIL-CHICAGO   2 / 1 6 / 2 0 00   The  vacant  ""blighted  area""  section  includes  five  (5)  other  tests  for  establishing  eligibUity,  but  none  of these  are  relevant  to the  conditions  within  the  Central  West  R.P.A.   Methodology  Overview  And  Detennination  Of  EligibiUty.   Analysis  of  eligibility  factors  was  done  through  research  involving  an  extensive  exterior  survey  ofall  properties  within  the  Central  West  R.P.A.,  as  well  as  a  review  of buUding and  property records.  Property records included  building code  violation  citations,  buUding  permit  data,  and  assessor  information.  Our  survey  of the  area  established  that  there  are  seven  hundred  five  (705)  buildings  within  the  Central  West R.P.A..  In addition,  to verify the age for the area buUdings, aerial  photographs  were  compared  to  structure  base  maps.   The areas located within the Central West R.P.A. are predominantly  characterized  by  commercial,  institutional,  residential,  and  mixed-use  structures  of  varying  degrees  of  deterioration.  All  properties  were  examined  for  qualffication  factors  consistent with either ""blighted area"" or ""conservation area"" requirements ofthe  Act.  Based upon  these  criteria,  the  properties  within  the  Central West R.P.A. quaUfy  for  designation  as  a  T.I.F.  Redevelopment  Project  Area  as  a  ""conservation  area""  as  defined  by the  Act.   To arrive  at  this  designation,  S. B. Friedman  86 Company  calculated  the  number  of  eUgibility  factors  present  on  a  buUding-by-buUding  basis  and  analyzed  the  distribution  of  the  eligibility  factors  on  a  block-by-block  basis.  The  eUgibUity  factors  were  correlated  to  buildings  using  Sanbom  Maps,  property  files  created  from field observations, and record searches.  This information was then  graphicaUy  plotted  on  a  block  map  of the  Central  West  R.P.A.  to  establish  the  distribution  of  eUgibffity  factors,  and  to determine which  factors  were present  to a  major  or  minor  extent.   Major  factors  are  used  to  establish  eUgibffity.  These  factors  are  present  to  a  meaningful  extent  on  most  of  the  blocks  and  evenly  distributed  throughout  the  R.P.A.. Minor factors  are supportirig factors  present to a meaningful  extent on  some  of the  blocks  or  on  a  scattered  basis.  Their  presence  suggests  that  the  area  is  at  risk  of more  extensive  deterioration  and  disinvestment.   Conservation  Area  Findings.   As required  by the  Act, within  a  conservation  area,  at  least fifty percent  (50%) of  the  buUdings  must  be  thirty-five  (35) years  of age  or older,  and  at  least  three  (3) of  the  fourteen  (14)  other  eUgibffity  factors  must  be  found  present  to  a  major  extent   "

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you, our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.      Our crews will install a new sewer in N. Keating Avenue, from Devon to 600’ south. The old  pipe dates back to 1928 and needs replacement.    We are coordinating with Alderman Laurino’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.         Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner     Cc: Alderman Margaret Laurino          39th Ward                                 1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             Do you wonder what was happening in 1928?  That’s the year the old sewer was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:               MICKEY MOUSE IN “STEAMBOAT WILLIE”     The first air-conditioned office opened, in San Antonio, Texas.    Mickey Mouse made his first appearance, in the short film “Steamboat Willie”.    Velveeta Cheese was created by Kraft.    Movie director Stanley Kubrick was born.    Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin.    Boston Garden officially opened.    The clip-on tie was designed.          .                              PROJECT DESCRIPTION   Project:  The Department of Water Management will install a new sewer in N. Keating Avenue,  from Devon to 600’ south.    Reason:  The old sewer main dates back to 1928, and needs to be replaced. Further, the area  bounded by Devon on the north, Rosemont on the south, Kilpatrick on the east, and the alley  west of Keating on the west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Construction will begin shortly, and conclude in February. Restoration will follow  when the weather allows.  Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is  any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:  Construction of the new sewer will require the daily closure of eastbound Devon  Avenue between Cicero and Kilpatrick from 7am - 3pm for a few weeks. During the daily  closure, traffic will be detoured via Cicero - Peterson – Pulaski. Otherwise, we will allow traffic  to flow outside of our working hours. You will always be able to reach your home or business,  even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open  for local traffic only. Safety is always our first consideration.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.         CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE         3-1-1        ALDERMAN MARGARET LAURINO      773-736-5594      DAVID MCGUIRE (ENGINEER IN CHARGE)   773-617-7187               FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS           Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Laurino, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.           DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!      "

Below are few highlights of our success.         New HIV infections in the city decreased for the 13th year in a row.    HPV vaccine coverage levels are higher than the national average.    CDPH’s  school-based vision, dental, STI prevention and restorative   Smoking rates among Chicago teens are at historic lows.   practice programs are serving thousands of students.     We successfully piloted a new model to identify restaurants more likely to   have serious violations.     CDPH coordinated several multi-program responses to public health   threats including a meningococcal disease outbreak among MSM, a cluster  of opioid overdoses and a gasoline leak on Chicago’s West Side     CDPH published the results from the first Healthy Chicago survey.    New, innovative mental health and support programs were launched for   vulnerable residents such as victims of sexual assault and family members  of homicide victims.  Several new grants allowed us to expand our work.  The Cultural Leadership Team was formed  to improve workplace culture.         We filled nearly 70 vacancies including many frontline/field staff and   supervisors and managers.     We secured a departmental budget that is aligned with our strategic plan.    I am really looking forward to launching Healthy Chicago 2.0 this year. Through  this four-year public health plan for the City and our ongoing activities, CDPH  and our partners will have the opportunity to coordinate and implement  numerous initiatives that will help create thriving communities and improve  the health and well-being of Chicagoans throughout the city. Let’s keep the  momentum going and make 2016 the best year yet!    Sincerely,                                                         Julie Morita, Commissioner       www.CityofChicago.org/Health            January is National Radon Action Month and CDPH is  encouraging Chicagoans to test their homes for  harmful levels of radon.  Radon is a naturally-occurring  colorless, odorless radioactive gas and is the leading  cause of lung cancer among non-smokers.  In fact, the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates  that radon causes more than 20,000 deaths from lung  cancer each year.  The best time to test homes for  radon is during cold-weather months when windows  are shut and elevated levels of radon are more likely  to be detected.  You can't see, smell or taste radon,  but it could be present at a dangerous level in your  home.  CDPH recommends taking action to fix radon  levels at or above 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L).  In  most cases, a system with a vent pipe and fan is used  to reduce radon.  Information on how to test, find a  qualified radon professional or obtain a test kit is  available at http://www.epa.gov/radon or by calling  the Cook County Radon Hot Line at (708) 865-6177.  Environmental Health     At the end of 2015, CDPH launched “Vaping,” a new   public education campaign dedicated to informing  youth and families about the health risks associated  with using e-cigarettes.  The campaign highlights areas  of concern regarding the highly addictive nature of  nicotine, the toxic chemicals and poisons found in e- liquids and vaping devices such as e-cigarettes being  unregulated at the federal level.  According to a new  CDC Vital Signs report, more than 18 million young  people see e-cigarette advertising in stores, online, in  newspapers and magazines, or on television and in  movies.  In addition, the report states that e-cigarette  ads use many of the same themes – independence,  rebellion and sex – used to sell cigarettes and other  conventional tobacco products.  Spending on e- cigarette advertising rose from $6.4 million in 2011 to  an estimated $115 million in 2014. In 2014, e- cigarettes became the most commonly used tobacco  product among youth, surpassing conventional  cigarettes.  The full report is available online at http:// www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/ecigarette-ads/index.html.

The Chicago Heat  Ordinance  mandates that  during cold  weather months  landlords supply  heat to rental  units or to any  unit where owners  do not have  individual control  of the heat.  From  September 15 to June 1, the temperature inside a   www.CityofChicago.org/Health   rental residence is required to be at least 68 degrees  from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. and at least 66 degrees  from 10:30 p.m. to 8:30 a.m.  If you are a renter and  your landlord is not providing adequate heat or no  heat at all, please call 3-1-1.     Policy Updates     In December, the City Council passed a measure to  double the penalties for retail tobacco dealers who  sell illegal cigarettes. All cigarette packs should have  tax stamps from the city, county and state to verify  that taxes are being paid.  But some business owners  have been failing to comply with the law. The  new ordinance increases fines from $1,000 to $2,000  for a first offense and from $2,000 to $4,000 for  subsequent offenses. If more than 40 unstamped  packs are found, fines are even higher. Repeat  offenders also face revocation of their tobacco license  and a one-year tobacco sales ban.            The Chicago-Cook Task Force on Heroin is set to have  its first meeting this month.  CDPH is participating in  the task force and will contribute to the  understanding of the heroin epidemic as a public  health problem. The task force will be meeting  periodically in the coming months to craft policy  recommendations for the city and county to reduce  opioid use disorder and overdoses.     Mayor Emanuel has introduced a groundbreaking   tobacco reform package in City Council to curb  tobacco use among youth and young adults. The  ordinance would raise the tobacco purchasing age  from 18 to 21, impose taxes on cigars and other  products beyond cigarettes and ban discounts that  tobacco companies use to skirt high taxes. These  reforms will help today's youth make healthy choices  and refrain from the potentially deadly effects of a  tobacco habit. The new taxes will also generate more  than $6 million in revenue to establish a universal  summer orientation program for all incoming  freshman at CPS schools.     Healthy CPS    CPS Active Schools will be participating in the Toews  Fitness challenge in the month of February.  Building  on last year's successful partnership, the Chicago  Blackhawks are providing materials to schools to  facilitate the month –long challenge in which  classrooms focus on a different aspect of physical  fitness and healthy eating each week.  Participating  classrooms are recognized for their efforts at the end  of the challenge.   Students are becoming more involved with the CPS  Nutrition Support Services Menu Selection  process.  Student groups at five schools have  participated in food tastings and provided their  feedback on possible new menu items.  Beginning January 18, 2016 all CPS high school  students will be given the opportunity to provide their  feedback individually through district-wide Student  View Point Survey.  The survey asks specific questions  about their thoughts on the school lunch program.                  "

(To  Ordinance)   Madden/Wells  Tax  Increment  Financing  Redevelopment  Area  FYoject  And  Plan.   I.   INTRODUCTION   This  document  is  to  serve  as  the  redevelopment  plan  (the  ""Redevelopment  Plan"")  for  an  area  located  on  the  near  south  side  of  the  City  of  Chicago  (the  ""City"")  approximately  four  miles  inunediately  south  of  the  City's  central  business  district  (the  ""Loop"").  The  area  is  generally  bounded by East 37* Street on the north, the west line ofthe  Illinois Central Rail Line on the east,  East Pershing Road  and  East  Oakwood  Boulevard  on  the  south  and  South  Vincennes  Avenue on  the west. This  area is referred  to in this document  as the Madden/Wells  Tax Increment  Financing  Redevelopment  Project  Area  (the  ""Project  Area"").  The  Project  Area  is  regionally  accessible  by  Lake Shore Drive and is less than two miles from the Dan Ryan Expressway.   As  part  of  a  strategy  to  encourage  managed  growth  and  stimulate  private  investment  within  the  Project Area, Oakwood Boulevard Associates, the developer of a proposed residential  development  within the Project  Area, engaged Trkla, Pettigrew, Allen &. Payne, Inc. (""TPAP"") to study whether  the Project Area of approximately 97.6 acres qualifies as a ""conservation area,"" a ""blighted area,"" or  a  combination  pf  both  blighted  areas  and  conservation  areas  under  the  Dlinois  Tax  Increment  Allocation Redevelopment Act (65 ILCS 5/11-74.4-1  et seq.), as amended  (the ""Act""). The Project  Area,  described  in  more  detail  below  as well  as  in the  accompanying  Ehgibility  Report,  has  not  been  subject  to  growth  and  development  through  investment  by  private  enterprise  and  is  not  reasonably expected to be developed without the efforts  and leadership ofthe  City.   The Plan  summarizes  the analyses and findings of the consultants'  work, which, unless  otherwise  noted, is the responsibility of ""TPAP"". The City is entitled to rely on the findings  and  conclusions  ofthis  Plan in designating the Redevelopment  Project  Area as a redevelopment project  area under  the  ""Act"".  The  Consultant  has  prepared  this  Plan  and  the  related  eligibility  report  with  the  understanding  that  the  City  would  rely:  I)  on  the  findings  and  conclusions  of  the  Plan  and  the  related eligibility report in proceeding with the designation ofthe  Redevelopment Project  Area and  the adoption and implementation ofthe  Plan, and 2) on the fact that the Consultant has obtained the  necessary information so that the Plan and the related eligibility report will comply with the Act.   A.   Madden/Wells  Tax Increment  F i n a n c i ng  Redevelopment Project  A r ea   The Project  Area contains  125 buildings  and  consists  of  13 fiill and/or partial blocks.

The Project  Area  is comprised  of an  improved  area  as well  as  five vacant areas. Ofthe  97.6 acres, approximately  80.6 acres are located within the improved  area  and  approximately  17.0  acres  are  located  within  the  five  vacant  areas.

By late October 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,883 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Bishop  Street, from W. 57th Street to W. 60th Street.  The old water main dates back to 1891, and needs to be  replaced. We expect the water main work to be completed by early January 2018.  Restoration will  follow in mid April 2018. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  16th Ward Office: 773-863-0220  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.

I want to  be certain you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to  call if you have any questions or concerns.    Our crews will soon be installing 1,073 feet of 16-inch water main in S. May St.  (Alley N. of W. 56th St. to W. 57th St.). The old main dates back to 1890 and  needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Thompson’s office, and she has made clear  we are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project.  Good communications is the  key.    I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely.  We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.    If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.      Thank you for your understanding and good will.      Sincerely    Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner      cc:   Alderman JoAnn Thompson       16th Ward                                                Do you wonder what was happening in 1890?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                    PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,073 feet of 16-inch water main  in S. May St. (Alley N. of W. 56th St. to W. 57th St.).    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Water main installation is anticipated to begin mid May, with completion of this  project projected for mid August. Completion of this project includes restoration. This, of  course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected developments in the street, or other  circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. May St. without interruption, but we will have to  restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOANN THOMPSON   773-434-3399                  ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid August. This  includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of  other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.     "

By late October, Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin the work to  install 3,160 feet of new 42 to 24-inch sewer main in W. Jarvis Avenue (Oriole-Overhill), in N.  Overhill Avenue (Jarvis-Sherwin), in N. Ottawa Avenue (Jarvis-Chase), in N. Oriole Avenue (Jarvis- Birchwood), and in N. Octavia Avenue (Jarvis-Birchwood).  The old sewer main dates back to 1930,  and needs to be replaced. DWM estimates the new sewer main will be installed, and the street will  be concrete capped by spring 2018.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  wwww.BuildingANewChicago.org to register for project notifications.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the project notifications, you will be informed as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always  be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open for  local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved by the start of  the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Parkway Maintenance  Before any project, the Department of Water Management (DWM) takes photographs of the street  and surrounding properties. These photographs help us restore the area to its preconstruction  state. However, DWM does not assume responsibility for damage to privately installed parkway  improvements, including sprinkling systems, fences, flower beds and shrubbery. New sewer  construction is not complete until damaged sidewalks, parkways and streets have been repaired.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    41st  Ward Office: 773-631-2241    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   This project involves replacing sewer structures that may have caused disruptions to your water  service line. We recommend that as a precaution you flush your water service of any sediment, rust  or metals, including any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside hose  spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where the  water comes into the home that is not used for drinking  water. Fully open the cold water tap and let the water run  for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any other cold water  faucets on that floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush any  taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.              If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.

Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner           Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household. "
