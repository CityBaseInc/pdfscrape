That amended denial letter incorporated the original law enforcement   basis for denial and also alleged the application was denied because the applicant has been   charged with committing a battery, with failure to cooperate with the police on November 29,   2009, concerning the battery investigation and with a happy hour violation committed on   February 10, 2010.  These charges are pending before the Local Liquor Control Commission in   case 10 LR 13.       Since this is a denial of an application the issue before this Commission is to determine   de novo the propriety of the denial of this incidental activity application for a license at this   address.  In order to better understand this decision, a summary of the proceedings which   consists of over 378 pages of transcript and over 27 exhibits is appropriate.       Prior to the start of evidence the City was given leave to amend the amended denial letter   to reflect that the date of the alleged battery was September 7, 2009.  This document is in   evidence as City’s Exhibit 8.  City’s Exhibits 1 through 7 were allowed in evidence as the    documents relied on by Norma Reyes and Gregory Steadman when they made their decision to   deny this application.       Mr. Maragos made a request that this Commission enter a pre-hearing order striking   portions of the amended denial letter referencing the Commission of a battery by the applicant as   a basis for denial.  This request was made on the basis that the criminal charges were disposed of                       2   favorably in Circuit Court.  The request was denied.        Also, prior to the start of evidence the parties entered into a stipulation that the Ole   Lounge at 2812 N. Lincoln Avenue has no prior disciplinary history since its inception in 2006,    aside from the charges pending under Case 10 LR 13.      Thomas Jenkins has been a Chicago Police Officer for eleven years and is presently a   tactical officer in the 19th District.  In late 2009, District Commander Kenny assigned him to   conduct a liquor license investigation regarding Tolgano, Inc., at 1834 West Montrose Avenue.    At the end of his investigation he recommended that Commander Kenny not authorize the liquor   license.  As part of his investigation he did a name check on Mitch Gundogdu and became aware   there was an investigative alert with probable to arrest for a battery sexual criminal assault.  An   investigative alert is issued by a detective and if the alert is with probable cause to arrest it   means a complaint has issued and the person will be arrested.  Jenkins called Mitch personally   and scheduled an appointment at the 19th District for November 28, 2009, at noon.  Mitch did not   appear for this meeting.  Jenkins called Mitch on November 29, and told him he needed to come   in.  Mitch replied he could not.  Jenkins told Mitch the liquor license application would not be   approved and Mitch said he did not care.  Mitch did say he wanted to send in a lawyer or a friend   but Jenkins insisted Mitch appear.  There were two conversations between Jenkins and Mitch   which Jenkins described as friendly, not hostile.  Jenkins felt that Mitch did not cooperate with   the investigation.  Jenkins was not involved in the eventual arrest of Mitch.                           3   On cross Officer Jenkins stated he was assigned this investigation by Commander Kenny   about November 25 or 26.  After Jenkins became aware of the investigative alert he contacted   Michele Wood who was the detective on the case who confirmed the investigative alert with   probable cause to arrest was still valid.  Jenkins did not know the investigative report was   initiated on September 26, 2009.  Detective Wood did not tell Jenkins what happened after the   investigative alert was issued and Jenkins was not aware if he was the first officer to speak to   Mitch.  He called Mitch on November 27 from a phone at the 19th District.  The number he   called from was (312) 744-5983.  Jenkins recalled Mitch said he would send a friend or lawyer   in but was not sure if Mitch said he had a partner.  Jenkins never contacted Mitch=s attorney prior   to writing his report that Mitch was uncooperative.  Jenkins acknowledged he had been trained in   the proper legal procedures involving criminal investigative alerts.  Jenkins also stated Mitch did   speak to him despite his Fifth Amendment rights.  Jenkins had done liquor license application   investigations for two years.  Jenkins initially went to the location of the applicant at 1834 W.   Montrose but it was papered up.  He did not ask anyone to open the door.  Jenkins stated he is   not aware of standard operating procedures for liquor license applications performed by the   Department of Revenue.  His investigation was an investigation for the district commander and   not done for the liquor commission.  He does not need to follow the Department of Revenue   procedures.  His was informal and he had Mitch pick the date and time for him to come in.  He   was doing a liquor license investigation for the district commander pursuant to the district   commander=s receipt of a letter from DBA about this application.  He is not involved in any   police investigation relative to revenue.  His investigations deal with calls for service and doing   name checks.  He deals only with police issues.  He is not aware of the rules and regulations of                       4   investigations before the DBA or the Department of Revenue.       Witnesses were taken out of order to expedite the proceedings.   This decision will   review the City=s case and then the defense witnesses.       John Kenny has been the 19th District Commander since March of 2008.  That district   includes 1834 W. Montrose Avenue.  His role in liquor license applications is to make a   recommendation of whether the license be approved or disapproved after he reviews the findings   of a member of his staff who has conducted a preliminary investigation.  He assigned Officer   Jenkins and Philbin  to investigate the application for 1834 W. Montrose Avenue. They   submitted a summary of their investigation to him on November 29, 2009.  Kenny reviewed that   summary and recommended the application be denied because the applicant failed to cooperate   in the preliminary investigation.  He identified City=s Exhibit 10, as a copy of his report created   on December 7, 2009.  Kenny is familiar with the Ole Lounge which is located within his district   at 2812 N. Lincoln.  He is aware Mr. Gundogdu is also the president of the Ole Lounge.  Kenny   is aware there had been an investigative alert issued regarding an incident that occurred at the   Ole Lounge.  Kenny is aware from Officer Jenkins’ report the Mr. Gundogdu did not appear at a   scheduled meeting with Officer Jenkins.  Kenny stated in his opinion the applicant did not   cooperate with the liquor license application process.  This lack of cooperation influenced his   decision to disapprove the application because it prevented his officers from doing a complete   investigation of the premises and the applicant.  Commander Kenny identified City=s Exhibit 11,   as a printout of calls to or from the address of 2812 N. Lincoln from January 1, 2009, and                       5   January 12, 2010.  It reflects 19 calls for service.  This includes five calls for batteries and two   calls for criminal sexual assault.       On cross Commander Kenny stated that his December 7, 2009, objection set out that Aat   this time,@ December 7, 2009, he disapproved of the application Adue to the fact that the owner   has an investigation No. 299961929.@  Kenny repeated that his disapproval was based on the   applicant=s refusal to come in to be interviewed.  The 19 calls for service was not a point of his   decision.  Kenny never stated in writing to anyone that Mitch Gundogdu Afailed to cooperate   with the police on this investigation alert.@  This was not his investigation.  His liquor license   report states either approve or denial and he attached the investigating officer=s report.  After   reviewing police reports Commander Kenny explained Police Officer Traci Tokarz wrote the   initial report but that the detectives from Area 3 would have done the investigation.  Kenny   never discussed this report with Officer Tocarz or Detective Wood.  The report from Officer   Jenkins indicated the applicant failed to come in for an investigative interview and that   constituted failure to cooperate.  Kenny indicated again the basis of his recommendation to   disapprove was a failure to cooperate with the liquor license investigation.  Kenny did not   consult with either Officer Jenkins or Philbin and did not consult with anyone as to what   constituted failure to cooperate.  Kenny was not aware that Mitch voluntarily submitted himself   with his attorney to be arrested and booked at the 19th District.  He is not aware of the disposition   of that case.            The City rested its case.                  6      Thomas Kamykowski is the Executive Director of the Ravenswood Chamber of   Commerce. That organization is located at 1756 W. Wilson which is about four blocks from the   applicant=s location.  The chamber has about 125 members and its purpose is to support   businesses in the Ravenswood community, to foster a reliable business environment in the area   and to try to contribute back to community.  It sponsors movies and concerts in the Chase Park   and holiday parties at local schools and parks.  The area around 1844 Wilson has gone through   hard times over the last couple of years.  The Brown Line AL@ station was closed for rehab for an   entire year and then there was a huge sinkhole.  There has also been street repair and seven   projects going on.  In the last six months their area has started to become very viable.  A   business like Wolcott=s would adhere to the changing character of that stretch of Montrose.  The   witness knows Mitch and Wolcott=s from stopping by to view the work going on.  The previous   site of Wolcott=s was an eyesore with employees getting into disputes with neighbors.  It was a   pizza place that disposed of grease improperly.  After the pizza business vacated the premises it   was vacant and attracted homeless people and marked by graffiti.  Wolcott=s would be an asset to   the community.  It would prevent crime in the neighborhood because it would conform to the   changing character of Montrose and would not be attracting the type of folks typically associated   with crime.  The witness identified Licensee=s Exhibit 1, as a letter he wrote in support of this   license.       On cross the witness stated he lives a couple of miles away but works in the   neighborhood and has worked in the neighborhood since January of 2000.  He does not know                       7   investigative alert.  Mr. Neville=s opinion is that Mitch did fully cooperate with the criminal   investigation.    On cross Mr. Neville stated he became aware of the liquor license application sometime   between September and December of 2009, but it was after he advised Mitch of his Fifth    Amendment Rights Neville repeated his advice was not to speak to any police officer unless he   was present and they both understood what the questions were going to be about. If someone had   called him and asked to be able to speak with Mitch about the liquor license application that   might have led to a different result.  He was not going to allow Mitch to speak with the police   when there was a criminal investigation ongoing.  Neville does not know how many times Mitch   was contacted by the police between September and December but it was many times.  Neville   made the one phone call to Officer Torres from September to December of 2009 and then spoke   to Officer Vargas on December 7, 8, and 14.  Neville could not state when he became aware   Mitch had an appointment with Officer Jenkins on November 28, 2009.  He knew there was an   investigation going on about the liquor license but his focus was on the criminal case in which he   was representing Mitch.  Mitch did not specifically seek his advice about the license   investigation. Mitch did not ask him to attend the November 28 meeting with Officer Jenkins in   his stead and he never called Officer Jenkins on behalf of Mitch regarding the November 28   meeting.          Mitch Gundogdu has been in the restaurant business since 1997.  He owned Figuero Bar   and Grill located at 4256 N. Western Avenue in 1997 and has owned the Ole lounge at 2812 N.   Lincoln since 2000.  He applied for and received liquor licenses for both establishments and did                       15   "

Since that time, we have seen significant  increases in public health and prevention funding, and withstood serious  legal  challenges  to  the  law.        Services  to  women,  young  adults  and  children  with  pre-existing  conditions  have  been  expanded.      With  the  Medicaid 1115  Waiver  granted  to  the  Cook  County Health  and  Hospitals  System, Medicaid enrollment of currently uninsured residents began this  year, well in advance of the 2014 mandated eligibility date.   Despite these  successes,  in  many  ways  the  real  work  is  just  beginning.    Earlier  this  month, the Illinois Senate approved  Senate Bill  26 (SB26)  which expands  the  State’s  Medicaid  program,  a  move  that  is  necessary  to  ensure  the  success  of  the  ACA.    Specifically,  SB26  will  leverage  Medicaid  to  cover  uninsured individuals earning approximately $15,000 a year, or less.  The  federal  government  will  pay  100%  of  the  cost  for  the  first  two  years,  dropping  to  90%  by  2020.    Overall,  the  program  is  essential  to  ensuring  society’s  most  vulnerable  populations  have  access  to  health  care  and  reducing costly emergency department visits.  I urge you to join CDPH and  support the passage of SB26 through the House by calling or emailing your  state Representative.     Sincerely,   Bechara Choucair, M.D.         www.CityofChicago.org/Health   On February 25, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and CPS CEO Barbara  Byrd-Bennett announced the expansion of the District’s Full  Day Kindergarten program. All 30,700 students entering CPS  next fall will be guaranteed access to the program. This is a  50% increase in access to full-day kindergarten since 2011.   The Child Health Data Lab of the Ann & Robert H. Lurie  Children’s Hospital of Chicago recently released a brief on  Bullying & Body Weight. The analysis uses data from the  Illinois Youth Risk Factor Behavior Survey. Among other  findings, the results show that those who are bullied at  school are more likely to be obese, more likely to be trying  to lose weight, and more likely to have vomited to lose  weight. To read the brief, go to  http://tinyurl.com/Bullying- BodyWeight. (Violence Prevention)   The Chicago Dating Matters Initiative (CDMI) hosted its  inaugural i2i Communications campaign event last month,  engaging 100 youth from CDMI participating schools. The  event was held at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Park & Family  Entertainment Center on the city’s Southwest side, where  many of the youth reside. The event included skating,  activities, and discussions about healthy relationships and  appropriate communication in interpersonal relationships.  (Violence Prevention)     HEALTHY CHICAGO IMPLEMENTATION                 On February 28, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Chicago Public  Schools (CPS) CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett and CDPH   Commissioner Bechara Choucair unveiled the Healthy CPS  Action Plan, which contains 60 detailed, district-wide and  concrete strategies to improve the health and wellness  of  Chicago’s students.   The plan builds on the Healthy Chicago  Agenda by outlining specific goals for student health.  The  Healthy CPS Action Plan can be found at  http://tinyurl.com/ HealthyCPS. (Multiple Strategies)   In recognition of National Condom Week (February 14-21),  the Chicago Community Condom Project teamed up with  City Colleges of Chicago to host campus-based information  tables and workshops on proper condom use and the  benefits of practicing protected sex.  The Chicago  Community Condom Project’s mission is to distribute 10  million free condoms per year through collaboration and  community partners. For more information,  go to    http://tinyurl.com/ChicagoCommunityCondomProject. (HIV  Prevention)   On February 14, the Chicago Department of Public Health  unveiled a new app that integrates health and wellness  technology to help mobile users assess their risk for heart  disease.  The app provides information about heart disease  risk, allows users to see if they are making progress on  health goals, and offers both a traditional and game version.  CDPH and AT&T teamed up to launch the app, which works  on the Apple iPad,  iPhone and iPod Touch. The app can be  downloaded at http://www.hearthealthmobile.com. (Heart  Disease & Stroke)   CDPH and Chicago Public Schools recently released a new  report, Overweight and Obesity in CPS Students. The report  provides a comprehensive look at the childhood obesity  epidemic.  Using over 59,794 de-identified student physical  exam records of students enrolled in kindergarten, sixth  grade, and ninth grade in the 2010-11 school year, the  analysis finds that the overall prevalence of obesity for the  three grades was 25%. The full report is online at http:/// tinyurl.com/childhoodobesityreport.  (Obesity Prevention)                    www.CityofChicago.org/Health                        HEALTHY CHICAGO IMPLEMENTATION                 On February 28, over 6,500 CPS students joined First Lady  Michelle Obama at McCormick Place to celebrate the third  anniversary of her Let’s Move! Campaign and the  introduction of the Let’s Move! Active Schools, both of  which coincided with the release of the Healthy CPS Action  Plan. Across the district, fifth through seventh graders  participated in the interactive, high energy event that was  designed to inspire students to eat healthy and stay active.   The goal of the Let’s Move! Initiative is to solve the problem  of childhood obesity within a generation. (Obesity  Prevention)      First Lady Michelle Obama and Chicago Public   Schools students at Let’s Move! Celebration.   HEALTHY CHICAGO POLICY HIGHLIGHTS                 On February 20, the Chicago Board of Health issued a letter to  the Illinois General Assembly to vote “yes” on House Bill 61 to  repeal Section 2a of the Communicable Disease Prevention Act.  Section 2a requires health departments to reveal the identity of  students who test positive for HIV to their principal. In the let- ter, the Chicago Board of Health states that due to increased  knowledge of HIV since the law’s passage 25 years ago, there  are no legitimate reasons for keeping the law on the books.  (HIV Prevention)   On February 28, Illinois SB26 passed the Senate. If it passes  through the House, the Bill will expand Medicaid eligibility. Be- ginning January 1, 2014, in accordance with the Affordable Care  Act individuals with incomes of up to 133% poverty will be eligi- ble for the Medicaid program, which will provide new coverage  for many more adults ages 19-64 who are uninsured. (Access to  Care)   The Chicago Board of Education passed a new sexual health  education policy that will make CPS the largest urban U.S.  school district with an established and comprehensive sexual  health education curriculum specifically designed for every  grade level, ensuring age-appropriate material and minimum  instructional minutes for each grade across a broad scope of   family and sexual health education topics.  (Adolescent Health)   On March 7, the Violence Against Women Act reauthori- zation was signed by President Barack Obama. The reau- thorization includes the continuation of effective pro- grams, expanded protections for gay couples and Native  American women, and provisions for the prevention of  violence. (Violence  Prevention)   Last week, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Chan- cellor announced that effective July 1, 2013, UIC will be- come a Tobacco–Free Campus.  UIC will launch a public  awareness campaign that will engage and inform its  27,500 students as well as faculty, staff, patients and visi- tors and educate them about the health risks and lifestyle  challenges associated with tobacco.  UIC joins three other  institutions of higher education and five hospitals in  adopting smoke-free campus policies to express their  commitment to making Chicago healthier.  (Tobacco Use)   As a result of Cook County’s Tobacco Tax Ordinance, on  March 1, cigarette taxes were raised by $1 per pack. Re- searchers estimate that the increase will keep 18,000  young people from becoming smokers. (Tobacco Use)   www.CityofChicago.org/Health   Healthy Chicago Grant News     The Asian Health Coalition (AHC) recently received a  $50,000 grant from the Asian & Pacific Islander Ameri- can Health Forum (APIAHF) to continue its work in the  Chinatown neighborhood and to implement policy and  environmental changes to address obesity prevention.  (Obesity Prevention)   CDPH received the following awards:   A continuation grant award for $400,000 from the Cook  County Torrens Fund, which will be used to abate lead  paint hazards in homes with young children. (Healthy  Homes)                            $9,743,315 of continuation funding (partial award) from  HRSA for the  Ryan White CARE Act Part A program to  provide health care, specialty care, and support services  to persons with HIV/AIDS  in the nine county eligible  metropolitan area. (HIV Prevention)      $25,000 in new funds from IDPH for the Biosense pro- gram. (Public Health Infrastructure)   A grant award from IDPH for $672,444 for the Mosquito  Vector Control program.  These funds are used to pur- chase and apply larvicide to kill larvae that are poten- tially infected with West Nile Virus.  Surveillance activi- ties are also covered for monitoring the course of the  disease and determining the appropriate areas for  spraying to kill infected adult mosquitoes.  (Communicable Disease Control & Prevention)         Getting The Word Out     The Chicago Park District is partnering with MEND Founda- tion to launch an admission free, 10-week healthy lifestyle  program open to families with children ages 7-13 who are  above a healthy weight at Palmer Park, 201 E. 11th Street.   The classes will take place twice a week after school from  April 1st  - June 19th ,2013.  In the program, families will  find out how to read food labels and take part in fun nutri- tion sessions.  They will also learn about healthy portion  sizes and will be shown the effect different foods have on  their health and wellbeing. During the program, children  will also take part in a wide variety of fun physical activities  and games.  Registration is required for the classes.  Please  contact Kelly Haley at 312-890-7059 or  Kelly.haley@chicagoparkdistrict.com to register or get  more information.

Everyone  should feel safe on our City’s streets, from an eight-year-old learning to ride a bike for the first time to an eighty-year- old who wants to ride to the store.  To achieve this goal, it is essential for us to look at all of the factors that contribute  to the safety of bicyclists on our streets, and to take the opportunity to make our streets safer for pedestrians and  auto users at the same time.  The Chicago Bicycle Crash Analysis looks at all aspects of bicycle crashes in the city.  With this report, we set out to  identify all of the factors that contribute to bicycle crashes in Chicago, and then set goals for improvement. The period  of study (2005-2010) gives us a clear picture of what we need to achieve the goals of Chicago’s Bike 2015 Plan and  the Streets for Cycling Plan 2020.  ii  The following report lays out benchmarks for various types of crash data and information. Locations, time of day,  gender and weather are just a few of the elements and factors we looked at to analyze crashes in Chicago.  At the end  of the report, you will find a comprehensive set of recommendations for improvements to our bike network and our  reporting mechanisms that will work to improve bicycling for all Chicagoans and visitors alike.

Through  a  combination  of  visionary  leadership,  thoughtful  planning,  inter-agency  cooperation  and  dedicated  resources,  Chicago  has created an impressive network of bicycle facilities that reach  every corner of the City. Residents currently enjoy a growing  network of over 170 miles of on-street bike facilities, quality  off-street paths (including the 18.5-mile Lakefront Trail), over  13,000 bike racks and sheltered high-capacity bike parking at  many Chicago Transit Authority rail stations. Chicago’s Bicycling   Ambassadors  and  other  outreach  and training programs are  among the most robust bicycle education and encouragement  initiatives in the country. These investments are beginning to  payoff as Chicago is in the midst of a ‘bicycling renaissance’.  Between 2000 and 2010, Chicago has witnessed a 150 percent  increase in the number of Chicagoans bicycling to work as well  as implementation of new and innovative bicycling facilities,  like protected bike lanes and bike parking “corrals.”   1  One key feature of a truly world-class bicycling city is the safety of its bicyclists. Bicycle crashes in Chicago remain a serious  concern. In the six-year period between 2005 and 2010, there were nearly 9,000 injury crashes involving bicyclists, with 32 bicyclist  fatalities. As a percentage of all traffic crashes, bicycle crashes are on the rise: from 6.7 percent of all crash types in 2005 to 9.8  percent of all crash types in 2010. Perhaps the most important point to be made is that with proper street design and behavior  change amongst road users, the overwhelming majority of bicycle crashes are preventable.  In May 2012, the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) launched Chicago Forward, a 2-year action agenda for improving  the  way  Chicagoans  get  around.  Chicago  Forward  establishes  two  goals  that  are  directly  focused  on  bicycle  safety:  reduce  pedestrian and bicycle crash injuries, each by 50 percent within 5 years and increase the total number of adults and children who  receive in-person safety education by 5 percent annually. As stated by Mayor Rahm Emanuel:   2  “One of my top priorities as mayor is to create a bike network   that allows every Chicagoan - from kids on their first ride to   senior citizens on their way to the grocery store - to feel safe   on our streets.”  For  these  reasons  and  more,  the  City  created  this  Chicago  Bicycle  Crash  Analysis.  The  purpose  of  this  report  is  threefold:  1)  to  analyze  bicycle  crashes  in  the  City of Chicago; 2) to identify key areas of concern and  3)  to  recommend  strategies  that  address  these  areas  of  concern,  in  order  to  reduce  crashes.  As  bicycling  in  Chicago  continues  to  grow,  the  City  of  Chicago  -  including its agencies, staff and elected officials - is more  committed than ever to making bicycling safer and more  accessible for all residents.  Summary ReportKEY FINDINGS  EXTENT OF BICYCLING AND HOW HAS IT CHANGED •  Since 2000, the number of bicycle commuters has increased by 150 percent.  •  Nationally 0.6 percent of workers commuted to work by bicycle in 2010. In Chicago, that number was 1.3 percent, or 15,000 cyclists daily.  •  Among peer cities, Chicago has more bicycle commuters per capita than New York or Los Angeles, but fewer than Philadelphia   or Seattle.   BICYCLE CRASH SAFETY TRENDS, 2005-2010 •  From 2005 to 2010 some 32 cyclists in the City of Chicago were killed in crashes with motor vehicles.  •  The number of fatal crashes decreased by 28 percent from seven in 2005 to five in 2010. •  Almost 9,000 bicyclist injury crashes occurred during the six-year period, or an average of 1,500 per year.  •  The number of injury crashes increased 27 percent from 1,236 in 2005 to 1,566 in 2010.  4  WHERE DID CRASHES OCCUR •  Approximately 55 percent of fatal and injury crashes occurred at intersections.  •  Six of Chicago’s 77 Community Areas, those just north and northwest of the Loop, accounted for more than one-third of the   bicycle miles traveled and one-third of the bicycle injury crashes.   Summary ReportBICYCLE SAFETY PROGRAMS IN CHICAGO  Beginning in 1992 with the publication of the Bike 2000 Plan, the City of Chicago has consistently demonstrated its commitment to  enabling and encouraging bicycling as a safe, healthy, environmentally-friendly and fun way to travel. Over the last two decades,  the Chicago Department of Transportation’s Bicycle Program has developed a robust, multi-faceted approach to creating a better  bicycling environment for the public. CDOT’s Bicycle Program focuses on a mix of infrastructure and programmatic approaches  for improving the bicycling experience in Chicago. Current initiatives include:  •  On-street bikeway installation •  Multi-use trail development •  Bicycle rack installation •  Bicycling and Pedestrian Ambassadors and Junior Ambassadors Programs •  Share the Road Outreach events (in partnership with the Chicago Police Department and Chicago’s Aldermanic Offices) •  Training videos and curricula for taxi drivers, Chicago Transit Authority bus operators and Chicago Police Academy cadets  •  Bicycle safety publications •  Chicago Bike Map  •  Mayor’s Bicycle Advisory Council  Chicago  is  fortunate  to  have  the  support  of  other  City,  County,  Regional  and  State  agency  partners  that  also  prioritize  and  promote bicycling and bicycle safety, including:  8  •  Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), Metra Rail and Pace Suburban Bus Service •  Chicago Park District and The Forest Preserve District of Cook County •  Chicago Police Department Bicycle Registry •  Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events’ Bike Chicago Initiative •  Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning  •  Cook County Highway Department  Illinois Department of Transportation •   Summary Report"

Although the Ebola outbreak is a humanitarian crisis in West Africa, the epidemic does not pose a  significant risk to the U.S. public. The Ebola virus does not spread easily. This fact sheet explains some basics  about the illness.     What is Ebola?  Ebola is a hemorrhagic fever virus that has appeared sporadically since its initial recognition in 1976 and named  after a river in the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa, where it was first recognized. The virus has also been  identified in bats and primates. Ebola causes severe illness. Between 50 and 90% of humans who become infected  with the virus die.   What are the symptoms?  Symptoms of Ebola include: fever, headache, joint and muscle aches, weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain,  lack of appetite and abnormal bleeding. Some patients may have a rash, red eyes, hiccups, cough, sore throat,  chest pain, difficulty breathing or swallowing or bleeding inside or outside the body.     Symptoms most commonly start 8-10 days after coming in contact with the Ebola virus but can occur as early as 2  days and up to 21 days after exposure.   How is Ebola spread?  The Ebola virus is spread by direct contact with blood or other body fluids (vomit, diarrhea, urine, breast milk,  sweat, semen) of an infected person who has symptoms or with a person who has recently died from Ebola. It may  also be spread through objects or surfaces contaminated by body fluids of a person infected with Ebola virus, for  example clothing or bedding. Ebola is not spread through the air or by water, or in general food.  However, in  Africa, Ebola may be spread as a result of handling bush meat (wild animals hunted for food) and contact with  infected bats.  It can also be spread by eating an animal that was infected with Ebola, including bats.    A person infected with the Ebola virus CANNOT pass it on to others before any symptoms appear.     Who is at risk for Ebola?  The risk of catching Ebola in the general public is extremely low. Healthcare providers or family members who care  for patients infected with Ebola in West Africa are at increased risk because they may come into contact with  blood or other body fluids.    What treatment is available?  There is no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola virus disease, though both are under investigation. Treatment  for Ebola is supportive with intravenous fluids, maintaining blood pressure and oxygenation and treating additional  infections if present.    How can I protect myself?  Avoid non-essential travel to areas in West Africa affected by the Ebola virus disease outbreak including Liberia,  Guinea and Sierra Leone.      •  DO wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  •  Do NOT touch the blood or body fluids (like urine, feces, saliva, vomit, sweat and semen) of people   who   are sick.   •  Do NOT handle items that may have come in contact with a sick person’s blood or body fluids, like clothes,   bedding, needles or medical equipment.   •  Do NOT touch the body of someone who has died of Ebola.

This support not only improved the quality of life for our artists and residents, but also contributed to    inspiring thousands of young creative minds and attracting millions of visitors along with several multi-national corporations    to Chicago.   Also, in 2013, the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) worked with you and other stakeholders to    set in motion the Chicago Cultural Plan, which includes hundreds of recommendations identifying ways the arts can build    community, stimulate economic development, create jobs, attract and grow tourism, and foster innovation. We invested $1    million in high-quality arts education for all Chicago Public School students, to implement CPS’s first-ever Arts Education    Plan – and we established the ambitious “Night Out in the Parks” program, with more than 750 cultural activities at Chicago    Park District locations across the city.   Since the world’s first skyscrapers rose from the ashes of the Great Chicago Fire, the City of Chicago and its residents    have worked tirelessly to position themselves at the forefront of art, culture and innovation. The blues were electrified on    Maxwell Street and house music was born in our basements. Our cutting-edge theater district and comedy venues contin­ ue to delight and entertain audiences the world over. Chicago’s culture is an integral part of world culture.   Our great culture has defined us as a truly global city and created an undeniable link between the value of arts and our    prosperity. My administration and DCASE are committed to continuing and strengthening this great tradition.   Sincerely,   4    commissioner’s letter   commissioner michelle t. boone  Dear Friends:   At the turn of the last century, Chicago was known as the ‘City of the Century’ owing to its world-class events, booming    industry and new, innovative ideas.   Working with the team at the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE), we are striving to make this    moniker true of the current century, as well, by producing spectacular lakefront festivals, vibrant neighborhood programming    and support for Chicago’s thriving creative industries – to continue to elevate our city as a global destination for creativity,    innovation and excellence in the arts.   Throughout 2013, DCASE presented nearly 2,000 programs, services and events, most of which were free to the public.    The department employed hundreds of local artists, partnered with a variety of arts organizations and also continued to in­ vest in strengthening the capacity of Chicago’s cultural sector by awarding more than $1 million in grants to cultural groups    and individual artists.   And, of course, we worked collaboratively with City departments, sister agencies, community organizations, artists and    other residents to implement the recommendations of the Chicago Cultural Plan. Released in October 2012, the Plan – the    first of its kind in over 25 years – created a framework to guide the city’s future cultural and economic growth, one where    the arts are accessible to all, cultural activities are abundant in every neighborhood and citizens and visitors alike can ex­ perience Chicago’s diverse and vibrant arts scene. In 2013, Mayor Emanuel and Chicago Public Schools unveiled CPS’s    first-ever Arts Education Plan; Mayor Emanuel and the Chicago Park District launched Night Out in the Parks, with more    than 750 citywide activities and performances throughout the summer; and Choose Chicago developed a new Cultural    Tourism Strategy for the city, released in January 2014.   DCASE remains committed to supporting Chicago’s arts community and making our city’s vast cultural resources accessi­ ble to all of our residents. To that end, the entire DCASE team is proud to serve Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the citizens of    Chicago.   Sincerely,   5   city of neighborhoods   Neighborhood Programming   The heart and soul of Chicago lives in its 77 vibrant neighborhoods and within the people who call them home.   In 2013, the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) renewed its focus on neighborhood programming –    bringing hundreds of free cultural events to communities across Chicago. DCASE once again presented the  Chicago Gospel Music Festival in historic Bronzeville, the birthplace of gospel music. We produced preview events  for The Chicago Blues Festival and The Chicago Jazz Festival at neighborhood Chicago Park District locations and  Chicago Public Library branches. DCASE brought its new Juicebox performance series for families to Austin Town  Hall Park and the Garfield Park Conservatory. And we brought 70+ vendors selling fresh fruits and vegetables to  Chicago neighborhoods, including (new in 2013) two spinoff markets: Logan Square Night Market and Argyle Night  Market, which also featured live performances, arts and crafts.     DCASE also collaborated with the Chicago Park District on several projects including Night Out in the Park, which brought    classical music, ballet and theater to our neighborhoods; World Music Festival Chicago; Chicago SummerDance – In The  Parks; and Chicago Artists Month.   In 2013, the 18th Annual Chicago Artists Month celebrated artists “In the Neighborhood” with more than 200 events  showcasing artists and creative professionals during October. Featured neighborhoods included East Garfield Park,  Edgewater/Uptown, Pilsen/Little Village, Portage Park, South Chicago and South Shore.            These initiatives helped advance several priorities of the Chicago Cultural Plan, which include:      n Elevate and expand neighborhood cultural assets  n Facilitate neighborhood cultural planning  n Integrate culture into daily life   6   city by the lake   Lakefront Festivals and Economic Impact   Chicago boasts 29 miles of shoreline, 27 beaches, a 18-mile bike path along Lake Michigan – and dozens of free  lakefront festivals.   DCASE celebrated milestone anniversaries of five major festivals in 2013: the 15th Annual Chicago Kids and Kites  Festival, the 15th Annual World Music Festival Chicago, the 30th Annual Chicago Blues Festival, the 35th Annual  Chicago Jazz Festival (which moved to its new home in Millennium Park) and the 55th Annual Chicago Air and Water Show.   The 33rd Annual Taste of Chicago drew 1.5 million people from all over the world to our city (an increase of 300,000  visitors over 2012) and served up new food options (including food trucks) and sold out concerts by chart-topping  acts, making the Taste profitable for the first time since 2007. The festival made $272,000 in profit, contributed over  $106 million in total business activity to the Chicago economy and generated nearly $2.4 million in tax receipts for  the city.   DCASE continued to partner with Choose Chicago, the official tourism organization for Chicago – striving to meet  Mayor Emanuel’s goal of 55 million visitors by 2020 by marketing many DCASE events and attractions regionally in  2013, specifically: Chicago Blues Festival, Chicago Gospel Music Festival, Chicago Jazz Festival, Taste of Chicago  and Millennium Park.   In total, our summer events contributed more than $246 million in total business activity to the Chicago economy and  generated well over $5.6 million in tax revenues for the city.   These initiatives helped advance several priorities of the Chicago Cultural Plan, which include:   n Strengthen Chicago as a global cultural destination  n Promote the value and impact of culture   8   city of big shoulders   Creative Industries   Creative workers make up almost 21% of Chicago’s workforce – and an estimated 63,008 artists work in Chicago.*   In 2013, DCASE continued to build our city’s creative economy by supporting and promoting creative industries such     as film, fashion, music and culinary. The Chicago Film Office facilitated another record year for Chicago film and television activity – citing a 20% increase in overall production activity – with major films and six full-time television shows in   production. Additionally, DCASE presented the first-ever Chicago Film and Media Summit in the fall,   featuring a keynote by producer/writer Dick Wolf.     Also during the fall, DCASE produced Fashion Focus: Chicago’s Fashion Week, a weeklong celebration of Chicago’s   thriving fashion industry – and during the summer, DCASE presented the Chicago Sidewalk Sale, a two-day shopping event showcasing Chicago fashion designers and independent boutiques.      In September, DCASE produced the first-ever Chicago Music Summit, a music industry conference sponsored by  Google which featured a keynote by rapper Common.   Many programs and initiatives supported the local culinary industry, including Chicago Farmers Markets, Taste of  Chicago and the popular City of Chicago Food Truck Rally on Daley Plaza in October.   DCASE supported individual artists and creative professionals through programs such as the Creative Chicago Expo, various Creatives at Work Forums and Chicago Artists Month.   These initiatives helped advance several priorities of the Chicago Cultural Plan, which include:   n Attract/retain artists and creative professionals  n Strengthen capacity of cultural sector  n Foster culture innovation          *Cultural Policy Center, The University of Chicago   10   millennium park  2013 Highlights   2013 attendance: 4,750,000   Cutting-edge architecture, landscape design and art provide the backdrop for hundreds of free cultural programs including concerts, dance  and theater events, exhibitions, tours and family activities.

By late January 2016, the Department of Water Management (DWM) and Joel Kennedy  Constructing Corp. crews will begin the work to install 2,744 feet of new 8-inch water main  in N. California Avenue, from W. Foster Avenue to W. Lawrence Avenue.  The old water  main dates back to 1917, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to www.buildinganewchicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply  enter your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this  letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:     •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  40th Ward Office: 773-769-1140  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for several  minutes.  The aerator screens located at the tip of your faucets should be removed prior to  flushing.    This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, or any  particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line as a result of  the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.     Sincerely,    Thomas Powers  Commissioner           "
