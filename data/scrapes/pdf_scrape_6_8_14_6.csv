(To  Ordinance)   Central  West  Redevelopment  Fhoject  Area.   Tax  Increment  Financing  District   Eligibility  Study,  Redevelopment  Plan  And  Fhoject.   October  26,  1999.   (Revised  October  29,  1999j  (Revised  January  18,  2000j   Executive  Summary.   In May,  1999, S. B. Friedman fit Company was engaged by the City ofChicago  (the  ""City"")  to  conduct  a  Tax  Increment  Financing  EUgibffity  Study  and  prepare  a  Redevelopment  Plan and Project  (the ""Redevelopment  Plan"").  This report details  the  eUgibility  factors  found  within  the  Central  West  Redevelopment  Project  Area  (the  ""R.P.A."") Tax Increment  Financing  (""T.I.F."")  District in support  ofits  designation  as   2 / 1 6 / 2 0 00   REPORTS  OF  COMMITTEES   2 5 2 81   a  ""conservation  area"" within  the  definitions  set  forth  in  the  Illinois Tax  Increment  Allocation Redevelopment Act, 65 ILCS 5/11-74.4-1, et seq., as amended  (the ""Act"").  This  report  also  contains  the  Redevelopment  Plan  and  Project  for the  Central  West  R.P.A.   The Central West R.P.A. is located within  the near west  side community  area  and  consists  of two thousand  ninety-four  (2,094)  tax parcels  on  one  hundred  ten  (110)  blocks  and  contains  approximately  four  hundred  sixty-three  (463)  acres  of  land.   Determination  Of  EligibUity.   This report concludes that the Central West R.P.A. is eligible for T.I.F.  designation  as a ""conservation  area"" because fifty percent  (50%) or more ofthe  structures  in  the  area have an age of thirty-five  (35) years or more and because the foUowing eligibiUty  factors  have  been  found  to be  present  to  a  major  extent:   depreciation  of physical  maintenance;   deterioration;   structures  below minimum  code;   inadequate  utilities;  and   deleterious  land-use  or  layout.   Additionally,  two  (2)  other  eligibUity  factors  are  present  to  a  minor  extent  and  demonstrate  that  the  Central  West  R.P.A.  is  in  a  state  of gradual  decUne  through  disinvestment.  Left unchecked,  these conditions could accelerate  the decline  ofthe  community  and,  combined  with  those  factors  that  have  been  documented  to  be  present  intensive  disinvestment.  These  factors  are:   to  a  major  extent,  could   lead   to  more  widespread  and   obsolescence;  and   excessive  vacancies.   25284   JOURNAL-CITYCOUNCIL-CHICAGO   2 / 1 6 / 2 0 00   3.   4.   Encourage  Private  Sector  Activities  and  Support  New  Development.  The  City  may  provide  financial  and  other  assistance  to  encourage  the  private  sector  to  undertake  redevelopment  and  rehabiUtation  projects  within  the  R.P.A..  In  order  to  facffitate  private  investment,  the  City  may  enter into agreements  within  the limits of the Act to facilitate  and  support  projects  this  Redevelopment  Plan.   the  goals,  objectives  and  strategies  of   that  support   the  City   to  attract   Facilitate  Property  Assembly,  Demolition  and  Site  Prepeiration.  Vacant  and  underutilized  sites  listed  in  Appendix  3  may  be  acquired  and  assembled  by  investment  and  development.  The  consolidated  ownership  of these  sites  will make  them  easier  the  redevelopment process.  In addition, assistance may be provided to private  developers  seeking  to  acquire  land  and  assemble  sites  in  order  to  undertake  projects  supportive  of this  Redevelopment  Plan.   to  potential  developers  and  will  streamline   future  private   to  market   Required  Findings.   The  required  conditions  for  the  adoption  of the  Redevelopment  Plan  and  P*roject   are  found  to be  present  within  the  Central  West  R.P.A.   First,  while  some  market-based  investment  has  occurred  in  the  Central  West  R.P.A. between  1994 and  1998, this investment  has  been minimal in scope and  not  part  of  any  coordinated  development  strategy.  Much  of  the  growth  in  Equalized  Assessed  Valuation  (""E.A.V."")  during  this  period  of  time  was  limited  to  a  small  number  of high-growth  parcels whose  1998 assessed  values were greater than  One  Hundred Thousand  DoUars ($100,000)  and whose assessments  grew thirty  percent  (30%)  or  more  during  the  study  period.  These  high-growth  parcels  represent  less  than  one  percent  (1%)  (seven-tenths  percent   (.7%)) of all parcels  within  the  R.P.A.  and  account  for approximately twenty-six percent  (26%) ofthe  R.P.A.'s total  growth  in E.A.V..  An additional three  percent  (3%) of the parcels within  the  R.P.A. grew in  value as a result of public subsidy.  These properties  accounted  for thirteen  percent  (13%) ofthe  total growth  in  E.A.V. during  this  period  of  time.  Combined,  the  high- growth  and  publicaUy  subsidized  parcels  have  had  minimal  impact  on  the  taxable  value  of surrounding  properties.  Excluding  these  parcels,  the  compound  annual  growth  rate  of  E.A.V. in  the  R.P.A. was  two and  eighty-eight  hundredths  percent   2 / 1 6 / 2 0 00   REPORTS  OF  COMMITTEES   ,   25291   containing  single-family  homes,  duplexes  and  two-flats,  and  several  publically- subsidized  housing  developments.  PublicaUy-  and  privately-owned  parking  lots  also are located in this area around  the United Center and several large  institutional  buildings  are  located  south  of  Adams  Street,  including  Malcolm  X  College  and  hospital-related  office  buildings.  The  central  portion  ofthe  R.P.A.  from  Ashland  Avenue  to  Throop  Street  contains  a  cluster  of  institutional  land  uses.  East  of  Throop  Street,  the  R.P.A.  contains  a  mix  of  larger  mid-rise  warehouse  and  distribution  facilities,  and  commercial  land  uses.  Many  of  these  buildings  offer  opportunities  for  rehabilitation  or  redevelopment.   Residential.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you, our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.      Our crews will install a new sewer in N. Keating Avenue, from Devon to 600’ south. The old  pipe dates back to 1928 and needs replacement.    We are coordinating with Alderman Laurino’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.         Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner     Cc: Alderman Margaret Laurino          39th Ward                                 1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             Do you wonder what was happening in 1928?  That’s the year the old sewer was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:               MICKEY MOUSE IN “STEAMBOAT WILLIE”     The first air-conditioned office opened, in San Antonio, Texas.    Mickey Mouse made his first appearance, in the short film “Steamboat Willie”.    Velveeta Cheese was created by Kraft.    Movie director Stanley Kubrick was born.    Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin.    Boston Garden officially opened.    The clip-on tie was designed.          .                              PROJECT DESCRIPTION   Project:  The Department of Water Management will install a new sewer in N. Keating Avenue,  from Devon to 600’ south.    Reason:  The old sewer main dates back to 1928, and needs to be replaced. Further, the area  bounded by Devon on the north, Rosemont on the south, Kilpatrick on the east, and the alley  west of Keating on the west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Construction will begin shortly, and conclude in February. Restoration will follow  when the weather allows.  Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is  any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:  Construction of the new sewer will require the daily closure of eastbound Devon  Avenue between Cicero and Kilpatrick from 7am - 3pm for a few weeks. During the daily  closure, traffic will be detoured via Cicero - Peterson – Pulaski. Otherwise, we will allow traffic  to flow outside of our working hours. You will always be able to reach your home or business,  even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open  for local traffic only. Safety is always our first consideration.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.         CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE         3-1-1        ALDERMAN MARGARET LAURINO      773-736-5594      DAVID MCGUIRE (ENGINEER IN CHARGE)   773-617-7187               FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS           Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Laurino, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.           DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!      "

Below are few highlights of our success.         New HIV infections in the city decreased for the 13th year in a row.    HPV vaccine coverage levels are higher than the national average.    CDPH’s  school-based vision, dental, STI prevention and restorative   Smoking rates among Chicago teens are at historic lows.   practice programs are serving thousands of students.     We successfully piloted a new model to identify restaurants more likely to   have serious violations.     CDPH coordinated several multi-program responses to public health   threats including a meningococcal disease outbreak among MSM, a cluster  of opioid overdoses and a gasoline leak on Chicago’s West Side     CDPH published the results from the first Healthy Chicago survey.    New, innovative mental health and support programs were launched for   vulnerable residents such as victims of sexual assault and family members  of homicide victims.  Several new grants allowed us to expand our work.  The Cultural Leadership Team was formed  to improve workplace culture.         We filled nearly 70 vacancies including many frontline/field staff and   supervisors and managers.     We secured a departmental budget that is aligned with our strategic plan.    I am really looking forward to launching Healthy Chicago 2.0 this year. Through  this four-year public health plan for the City and our ongoing activities, CDPH  and our partners will have the opportunity to coordinate and implement  numerous initiatives that will help create thriving communities and improve  the health and well-being of Chicagoans throughout the city. Let’s keep the  momentum going and make 2016 the best year yet!    Sincerely,                                                         Julie Morita, Commissioner       www.CityofChicago.org/Health            January is National Radon Action Month and CDPH is  encouraging Chicagoans to test their homes for  harmful levels of radon.  Radon is a naturally-occurring  colorless, odorless radioactive gas and is the leading  cause of lung cancer among non-smokers.  In fact, the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates  that radon causes more than 20,000 deaths from lung  cancer each year.  The best time to test homes for  radon is during cold-weather months when windows  are shut and elevated levels of radon are more likely  to be detected.  You can't see, smell or taste radon,  but it could be present at a dangerous level in your  home.  CDPH recommends taking action to fix radon  levels at or above 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L).  In  most cases, a system with a vent pipe and fan is used  to reduce radon.  Information on how to test, find a  qualified radon professional or obtain a test kit is  available at http://www.epa.gov/radon or by calling  the Cook County Radon Hot Line at (708) 865-6177.  Environmental Health     At the end of 2015, CDPH launched “Vaping,” a new   public education campaign dedicated to informing  youth and families about the health risks associated  with using e-cigarettes.  The campaign highlights areas  of concern regarding the highly addictive nature of  nicotine, the toxic chemicals and poisons found in e- liquids and vaping devices such as e-cigarettes being  unregulated at the federal level.  According to a new  CDC Vital Signs report, more than 18 million young  people see e-cigarette advertising in stores, online, in  newspapers and magazines, or on television and in  movies.  In addition, the report states that e-cigarette  ads use many of the same themes – independence,  rebellion and sex – used to sell cigarettes and other  conventional tobacco products.  Spending on e- cigarette advertising rose from $6.4 million in 2011 to  an estimated $115 million in 2014. In 2014, e- cigarettes became the most commonly used tobacco  product among youth, surpassing conventional  cigarettes.

The Chicago Heat  Ordinance  mandates that  during cold  weather months  landlords supply  heat to rental  units or to any  unit where owners  do not have  individual control  of the heat.  From  September 15 to June 1, the temperature inside a   www.CityofChicago.org/Health   rental residence is required to be at least 68 degrees  from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. and at least 66 degrees  from 10:30 p.m. to 8:30 a.m.  If you are a renter and  your landlord is not providing adequate heat or no  heat at all, please call 3-1-1.     Policy Updates     In December, the City Council passed a measure to  double the penalties for retail tobacco dealers who  sell illegal cigarettes. All cigarette packs should have  tax stamps from the city, county and state to verify  that taxes are being paid.  But some business owners  have been failing to comply with the law. The  new ordinance increases fines from $1,000 to $2,000  for a first offense and from $2,000 to $4,000 for  subsequent offenses. If more than 40 unstamped  packs are found, fines are even higher. Repeat  offenders also face revocation of their tobacco license  and a one-year tobacco sales ban.            The Chicago-Cook Task Force on Heroin is set to have  its first meeting this month.  CDPH is participating in  the task force and will contribute to the  understanding of the heroin epidemic as a public  health problem. The task force will be meeting  periodically in the coming months to craft policy  recommendations for the city and county to reduce  opioid use disorder and overdoses.     Mayor Emanuel has introduced a groundbreaking   tobacco reform package in City Council to curb  tobacco use among youth and young adults. The  ordinance would raise the tobacco purchasing age  from 18 to 21, impose taxes on cigars and other  products beyond cigarettes and ban discounts that  tobacco companies use to skirt high taxes. These  reforms will help today's youth make healthy choices  and refrain from the potentially deadly effects of a  tobacco habit. The new taxes will also generate more  than $6 million in revenue to establish a universal  summer orientation program for all incoming  freshman at CPS schools.     Healthy CPS    CPS Active Schools will be participating in the Toews  Fitness challenge in the month of February.  Building  on last year's successful partnership, the Chicago  Blackhawks are providing materials to schools to  facilitate the month –long challenge in which  classrooms focus on a different aspect of physical  fitness and healthy eating each week.  Participating  classrooms are recognized for their efforts at the end  of the challenge.   Students are becoming more involved with the CPS  Nutrition Support Services Menu Selection  process.  Student groups at five schools have  participated in food tastings and provided their  feedback on possible new menu items.  Beginning January 18, 2016 all CPS high school  students will be given the opportunity to provide their  feedback individually through district-wide Student  View Point Survey.  The survey asks specific questions  about their thoughts on the school lunch program.                  "

(To  Ordinance)   Madden/Wells  Tax  Increment  Financing  Redevelopment  Area  FYoject  And  Plan.   I.   INTRODUCTION   This  document  is  to  serve  as  the  redevelopment  plan  (the  ""Redevelopment  Plan"")  for  an  area  located  on  the  near  south  side  of  the  City  of  Chicago  (the  ""City"")  approximately  four  miles  inunediately  south  of  the  City's  central  business  district  (the  ""Loop"").  The  area  is  generally  bounded by East 37* Street on the north, the west line ofthe  Illinois Central Rail Line on the east,  East Pershing Road  and  East  Oakwood  Boulevard  on  the  south  and  South  Vincennes  Avenue on  the west. This  area is referred  to in this document  as the Madden/Wells  Tax Increment  Financing  Redevelopment  Project  Area  (the  ""Project  Area"").  The  Project  Area  is  regionally  accessible  by  Lake Shore Drive and is less than two miles from the Dan Ryan Expressway.   As  part  of  a  strategy  to  encourage  managed  growth  and  stimulate  private  investment  within  the  Project Area, Oakwood Boulevard Associates, the developer of a proposed residential  development  within the Project  Area, engaged Trkla, Pettigrew, Allen &. Payne, Inc. (""TPAP"") to study whether  the Project Area of approximately 97.6 acres qualifies as a ""conservation area,"" a ""blighted area,"" or  a  combination  pf  both  blighted  areas  and  conservation  areas  under  the  Dlinois  Tax  Increment  Allocation Redevelopment Act (65 ILCS 5/11-74.4-1  et seq.), as amended  (the ""Act""). The Project  Area,  described  in  more  detail  below  as well  as  in the  accompanying  Ehgibility  Report,  has  not  been  subject  to  growth  and  development  through  investment  by  private  enterprise  and  is  not  reasonably expected to be developed without the efforts  and leadership ofthe  City.   The Plan  summarizes  the analyses and findings of the consultants'  work, which, unless  otherwise  noted, is the responsibility of ""TPAP"". The City is entitled to rely on the findings  and  conclusions  ofthis  Plan in designating the Redevelopment  Project  Area as a redevelopment project  area under  the  ""Act"".  The  Consultant  has  prepared  this  Plan  and  the  related  eligibility  report  with  the  understanding  that  the  City  would  rely:  I)  on  the  findings  and  conclusions  of  the  Plan  and  the  related eligibility report in proceeding with the designation ofthe  Redevelopment Project  Area and  the adoption and implementation ofthe  Plan, and 2) on the fact that the Consultant has obtained the  necessary information so that the Plan and the related eligibility report will comply with the Act.   A.   Madden/Wells  Tax Increment  F i n a n c i ng  Redevelopment Project  A r ea   The Project  Area contains  125 buildings  and  consists  of  13 fiill and/or partial blocks. The  Project  Area encompasses  a total of approximately  97.6 acres ofwhich  27.3 acres (27.9%) are devoted  to  alley, street  and rail rights-of-way. The Project  Area  is comprised  of an  improved  area  as well  as  five vacant areas. Ofthe  97.6 acres, approximately  80.6 acres are located within the improved  area  and  approximately  17.0  acres  are  located  within  the  five  vacant  areas.  For  a  map  depicting  the  boundaries  and delineation  of improved  and vacant  areas  see Figure  I, Project Area  Boundary.  A  legal  description  of  the  Project  Area  is  included  in  Section  II,  Legal  Description  and  Project  Boundary.   11/6/2002   REPORTS  OF COMMITTEES   95531   2.  One of Six  Factors   Vacant areas within the Project  Area may also qualify  for designation  as part of a redevelopment  project  area,  ifthe  sound  growth  ofthe  redevelopment  project  area  is impaired  by  1 of  6  other  factors  listed  in  section  ll-74.4-3(a)(3)  of  the  Act,  that  (i)  is  present,  with  that  presence  documented,  to a meaningful  extent  so that  a municipality  may reasonably find that the  factor  is  clearly present within the intent ofthe  Act and (ii) is reasonably distributed throughout the vacant  part  of  the  redevelopment  project  area  to  which  it  pertains.  The  only  factor  that  is  present  is  defined  in the Act as follows:   The area  qualified  as  a  blighted  improved  area  immediately prior  to  becoming  vacant  and  there has not been substantial private investment in the immediately surrounding area.   Vacant  Subarea  I  is the  fonner  site  of the  Clarence  Danow  Homes, which  included  four  CHA  buildings  containing  120  residential  units  each.  Conditions  present  in  the  Clarence  Danow  Homes were documented  in the Application for  Total Demolition  of Low-Income Public Housing  -  Clarence  Darrow  Homes  (the  ""CHA  Demolition  Application""),  which  was  submitted  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  the  MaddenAVells/Danow  HOPE  VI  AppUcation  submitted  in  May  2000.  Three  of  the  four  buildings  were  demoUshed  in  1999  and  the  fourth  was  demoUshed  in  2000.  The  problem  conditions  documented  in  the  CHA  Demolition  Application  and  the  HOPE  VI  Application  are  the basis  by which  it  has  been  determined  that  the  area  quaUfied  as  a  blighted  improved  a'ea  immediately prior to becoming vacant.   July  26,  1995,  and   Using the definitions  for an improved blighted  area as stated  in the Act and presented  previously  in Section II.B, a summary' evaluation  of the  9 improved  area blight  factors  that were present  in  Vacant Subarea  I prior to becoming vacant is presented below.   1.  Dilapidation  -  The  4  CHA  buildings  were  determined  to  be  stmcturally  substandard  -with  defects  so serious that the buildings must be removed. The buildings were demoUshed in  1999  and 2000.   2.  Obsolescence  -  The  CHA  Demolition  Application  cited  a  number  of  obsolete  systems  by  today's standards including the central heating system, the electrical service, which required an  upgrade in order to comply vrith City of Chicago Building Code; and dwelling units, common  areas  and  elevators,  which  required  upgrades  to  meet  cunent  ADA  codes.

By late October 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,883 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Bishop  Street, from W. 57th Street to W. 60th Street.  The old water main dates back to 1891, and needs to be  replaced. We expect the water main work to be completed by early January 2018.  Restoration will  follow in mid April 2018. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  16th Ward Office: 773-863-0220  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

I want to  be certain you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to  call if you have any questions or concerns.    Our crews will soon be installing 1,073 feet of 16-inch water main in S. May St.  (Alley N. of W. 56th St. to W. 57th St.). The old main dates back to 1890 and  needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Thompson’s office, and she has made clear  we are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project.  Good communications is the  key.    I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely.  We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.    If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                    PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,073 feet of 16-inch water main  in S. May St. (Alley N. of W. 56th St. to W. 57th St.).    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Water main installation is anticipated to begin mid May, with completion of this  project projected for mid August. Completion of this project includes restoration. This, of  course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected developments in the street, or other  circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. May St. without interruption, but we will have to  restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOANN THOMPSON   773-434-3399                  ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid August. This  includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of  other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.     "

By late October, Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin the work to  install 3,160 feet of new 42 to 24-inch sewer main in W. Jarvis Avenue (Oriole-Overhill), in N.  Overhill Avenue (Jarvis-Sherwin), in N. Ottawa Avenue (Jarvis-Chase), in N. Oriole Avenue (Jarvis- Birchwood), and in N. Octavia Avenue (Jarvis-Birchwood).  The old sewer main dates back to 1930,  and needs to be replaced. DWM estimates the new sewer main will be installed, and the street will  be concrete capped by spring 2018.

Parkway Maintenance  Before any project, the Department of Water Management (DWM) takes photographs of the street  and surrounding properties. These photographs help us restore the area to its preconstruction  state. However, DWM does not assume responsibility for damage to privately installed parkway  improvements, including sprinkling systems, fences, flower beds and shrubbery. New sewer  construction is not complete until damaged sidewalks, parkways and streets have been repaired.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    41st  Ward Office: 773-631-2241    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   This project involves replacing sewer structures that may have caused disruptions to your water  service line. We recommend that as a precaution you flush your water service of any sediment, rust  or metals, including any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.

Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner           Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.

The Commission is re- sponsible for recommending to the City Council which individual buildings, sites, objects, or  districts should be designated as Chicago Landmarks, which protects them by law.   The landmark designation process begins with a staff study and a preliminary summary  of information related to the potential designation criteria. The next step is a preliminary vote  by the landmarks commission as to whether the proposed landmark is worthy of consideration.  This vote not only initiates the formal designation process, but it places the review of city per- mits for the property under the jurisdiction of the Commission until a final landmark recom- mendation is acted on by the City Council.   This Landmark Designation Report is subject to possible revision and amendment dur- ing the designation process. Only language contained within a designation ordinance adopted  by the City Council should be regarded as final.   2                   1956  Harry Weese    227 EAST WALTON PLACE APARTMENT  BUILDING  227 E. Walton Place    Date of Construction:  Architect:       The 227 East Walton Place Apartment Building is a significant post-World War II structure by a  noteworthy Chicago architect.  It is a thirteen-story, 24-unit apartment building designed by  Harry Weese, one of Chicago’s most eclectic and innovative architects of the modern American  architectural movement.  Through its incorporation of features inspired by historic Chicago  School buildings, including, most distinctively, projecting three-sided bay windows, 227 East  Walton Place combines modernist design with references to past architecture, highly unusual  and inventive in the context of 1950s-era Chicago high-rise architecture.      Harry Weese, the designer of the 227 East Walton Place Apartment Building, was one of the  most significant architects working in Chicago from the early 1950s through at least the 1990s,  during which time he demonstrated his accomplishments as a modern architect, urban planner,  and preservation architect through commissions in Chicago, nationally, and internationally. He  questioned the primacy of the International Style modernism being championed in Chicago in  the 1950s and 1960s by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and his followers.  Weese fought for mod- ern architecture that would be more humane and responsive to historic architectural traditions  and to urban context.  227 East Walton Place exemplifies Weese’s interest as a modern architect  in the primacy of human scale and texture over the machine-made, in contextual design over a  ""one-size-fits all"" approach, and in the importance of the continuity of architectural history  rather than a clean break from the past, all of which set him apart from the American architec- tural mainstream of the 1950s.  A comprehensive study of Weese’s life, work and influence was  published by Robert Bruegmann and Kathleen Murphy Skolnik in their 2010 The Architecture  of Harry Weese, a monograph to which this report owes much.     Built in 1956, a time when suburbs were draining Chicago’s population, 227 East Walton Place  reflects Harry Weese’s vision that downtown Chicago could foster a range of uses beyond work,  including residential and recreation.   The building is an early, excellently-designed apartment  tower, a building type that exemplifies the rapid development of lakefront neighborhoods such  as Streeterville, where the building is located, during the 1950s and 1960s.   3   Located midway between North Michigan Avenue and the lake, the 227 East Walton Place Apartment Build- ing is a thirteen-story, 24-unit apartment building designed by Harry Weese, one of Chicago’s most prolific  and singular architects of the modern era.  Rather than breaking from the past, Weese referenced visual ele- ments from Chicago’s architectural history in the stacked projecting window bays, a design element derived  from the late-nineteenth century Chicago School buildings.  The brick cladding suggests warmth and unpre- tentiousness and reflects the architect’s interest in Scandinavian modernism.   4   BUILDING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION    The 227 East Walton Place Apartment Building is located two blocks east of Chicago’s fash- ionable North Michigan Avenue and one block west of North Lake Shore Drive in the Streeter- ville neighborhood.  As they are today, the surrounding blocks in 1956 were distinguished by  luxury apartments, shopping and dining.  Chicago architect Harry Weese acted as both designer  and speculative developer of the building, a combination that was generally discouraged by the  architectural profession at the time.  John Baird, then a vice president at the real estate broker- age firm of Baird & Warner, partnered with Weese on the development.  The partners pur- chased the 50-foot-wide lot on which the building is located for $40,000, and its construction  was announced in the Chicago Tribune on July 2, 1955, in a short article that touted the innova- tive radiant heating and cooling systems planned for the building.      Roughly square in plan, the compact building measures 50’ across its front elevation facing E.  Walton Place block raised above a recessed first floor. The exterior wall plane is only carried  down to the first floor in limited areas such as the central stairwell enclosure on the north eleva- tion and the rectangular piers on the east and west elevations.  The east side of the first floor  contains a small lobby with floor-to-ceiling windows and visually-distinctive, modernist exte- rior door hardware which appears to be original.  A driveway next to the lobby leads to rear  ground-level parking.  The west side of the first floor contains a service entrance and a ramp  down to basement parking.  The cast-in-place reinforced concrete structure of the building is  painted white but otherwise left exposed at the first floor.      Above the first floor, the walls are clad in vertical bands of visually-warm red brick alternating  with vertical bands of stacked window openings giving the building a striped appearance.  The  unornamented flat planes of brick are relieved by the window stacks which either project or re- cede from the brick wall plane.  Windows are steel-sash with operable casements.  To balance  the verticality of the window stacks, the concrete floor plates between each story are left ex- posed lending the design a human scale and visually expressing the structure of the building.   Unlike the steel-and-glass curtain-walled residential towers being perfected at the time by fel- low Chicago architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Weese limited the building’s window area to  50 percent of the exterior envelope to create a more private interior and to allow more flexibil- ity in interior furnishing.  The building is topped with a flat roof with mechanical equipment.    At the front elevation of 227 E. Walton Place, Weese used three-sided, projecting bay windows  arranged in two vertical stacks.  Such projecting bay windows were a defining feature of Chi- cago’s early Chicago School skyscrapers, such as the Reliance and Monadnock buildings, as  well as hotels such as the Metropole and Plaza, that preceded Walton by half a century.  Just as  they had been used in the past, projecting bay windows enhanced views up and down the street  and improved lighting and ventilation.  They also give the front façade an undulating quality.   Weese would use projecting bays again in his designs for the Pierce Dormitory at the University  of Chicago (1959) and the John Fewkes Tower apartments at 55 W. Chestnut Street (1967), and  it was a motif adopted by other architects in Chicago well into the 1970s.         5   The base of the building with recessed lobby and ex- posed concrete structure.    227 E. Walton is an early and significant tall  apartment building from the post-World War II  era.  Its combination of modern architecture  with cues relating it to historic Chicago archi- tecture is exceptional for the 1950s.    Vertical bands of brick alternating with projecting bays  gives the building a striped appearance   The original  entrance door  with custom  hardware  (bottom left)  and a detail of a  window bay  revealing the  concrete struc- ture of the  building  (bottom right).   6   Weese claimed:     if present day architecture is ever to mature, it needs to eschew the fashion of  the hour and consider the realities of decades.  The art of building is not re- learned every generation; it is an ongoing thing. We must find the thread of this  continuum and build well… Faced with the choice, I would rather be right than  contemporary.     The projecting bays at 227 East Walton Place reveal Weese’s willingness to borrow elements  from Chicago’s architectural history, an extremely unusual approach within the context of mod- ern architecture in America in the 1950s, a time when most architects rejected historical prece- dents.      Weese chose a warm red brick for the exterior that looks very much like the “Chicago com- mon” brick which clads the utilitarian side and rear elevations of so many of the city’s historic  buildings.  Brick, which could be made and assembled by hand, lends the building a textured  and domestic feel that was quite different from the machined steel-and-glass buildings of Inter- national Style Modernism.  The choice of brick also reflects the influence of Scandinavian mod- ernism on Weese, gained through his architectural training and friendships with architects Alvar  Aalto and Eliel Saarinen, along with Eliel's son Eero.    Weese stated that “we [Harry Weese & Associates] are not afraid to use forms that are outdated  if they have any function.  We are willing to risk seeming inconsistent.  I get a great deal of  pleasure in discovering old things that can be made new again as well as discovering new com- binations.”  At 227 East Walton Place he combined the bay window from nineteenth-century  Chicago School commercial and residential architecture with the humble red brick of the city’s  vernacular buildings to create a contemporary, functional and unusual apartment design.  In ad- dition to being more affordable than glass-and-steel curtain walls, these borrowed elements at  227 East Walton Place helped the building “fit” in more readily in its surrounding context of  1920s-era apartment and hotel buildings and created a more familiar appearance for the general  public who had little interest in high-style “-isms.”     On the building's interior, each floor contains only two apartments which are accessed by a  small, semi-private elevator lobby, reflecting Weese's distaste for long corridors in apartment  buildings.  Promoted as “spacious, yet designed for efficient housekeeping,” each two-bedroom  apartment included a foyer, living room, kitchen, dining area and two bathrooms.  Interior fin- ishes included plaster walls with limited paneling, plus parquet and cork flooring.  Heating and  cooling were provided by heated or chilled water circulated through radiant tubing embedded in  the walls.  Radiant cooling was a relatively new and untested technology at the time, and subse- quent problems with condensation on wall surfaces led to its abandonment.    The building was marketed by Harry Weese and Baird and Warner as cooperative apartments;  however they failed to sell and the building was instead operated for years as a rental property.   Harry Weese and John Baird sold the building in the mid-1960s, and in 1969 it was converted  to condominiums, which it remains to this day.    227 East Walton Place was an important commission for Harry Weese, then a 41-year-old ar-  7   chitect whose body of work up to that point had consisted mostly of suburban houses.  The  building's design was published in architectural journals after it was completed and republished  later throughout Weese’s career in articles about him.  It was also noted early on in architectural  histories such as architectural historian Carl Condit's Chicago, 1930-1960, where it was pub- lished along with such iconic residential high rises as Mies's 860-880 North Lake Shore Drive  towers and Bertrand Goldberg's Marina City complex.      In the 227 East Walton Place Apartment Building, we see motivations which would continue to  drive Weese throughout his career: his interest in historic architecture; his appreciation and  emulation of mid-century Scandinavian modernism, with its often-modest scale and visual sen- sibility; and his desire to create buildings that fit contextually into existing neighborhoods,  amidst historic buildings, while retaining the modernist insistence on functionality.        227 EAST WALTON PLACE AND   POST-WORLD WAR II CHICAGO APARTMENT DESIGN    The 227 East Walton Place Apartment Building is a significant tall apartment building built  early in the post-World War II boom years of the 1950s and 1960s, when Chicago’s lakefront  neighborhoods, including the Streeterville neighborhood in which the building is located, were  being transformed with the construction of high-rise apartment buildings.      The first widespread phase of tall-apartment building construction in Chicago occurred in the  1920s.  During that decade of great growth, many neighborhoods along Lake Michigan, from  Edgewater on the north to Hyde Park on the south, were built up with apartment buildings rang- ing from ten to twenty stories in height.  Most were designed in a variety of historic revival ar- chitectural styles, including Classical, Renaissance, Gothic and Tudor.    The Stock Market crash of October 1929, followed by the Great Depression, led to the cessation  of almost all Chicago real-estate activity, including apartment building construction.  This  building hiatus continued through the mid-1940s during World War II when next to no private  real-estate development occurred in America.  As the country emerged from the war, develop- ment slowly picked up, and by the late-1940s, tall apartment buildings began to be built again  in Chicago.    In the postwar period there was a popular consensus in Chicago and nationally that existing  housing stock, especially that built before the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, was inade- quate and in need of rebuilding.  In addition to driving suburban development, this consensus  led to government-subsidized urban renewal programs as well as privately-funded speculative  development of new types of multi-family housing within Chicago’s neighborhoods beginning  in the late 1940s.      New apartment buildings constructed in the post-war period tended to be designed in modern  architectural styles, as both contemporary economics and taste had turned toward visually- simpler, non-historic styles.  This emphasis on modernism took several different forms.  Inter-  9   nationally-renowned architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, at the time the head of the architec- ture school at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, favored a variation of the Interna- tional Style, a modern idiom developed in Europe during the 1920s and 1930s that favored  starkly functional-looking, metal-and-glass walls wrapping around steel or concrete structural  frames.  Mies emphasized transparency and sleekness while breaking completely with historic  architectural styles. The twin high-rise apartment buildings at 860-880 N. Lake Shore Drive  (built from 1949-51, a designated Chicago Landmark) were Mies's first expression of this  metal-and-glass architectural ideal in Chicago.      Another popular iteration of modern apartment tower design promoted by Mies and his follow- ers clearly expressed a building’s underlying skeleton frame, using the rectilinear grid formed  by the building’s structure as a primary visual element.  Glass, usually accompanied by metal or  masonry, was then used to create exterior walls within this exposed structural grid, formed typi- cally of cast concrete.  Such buildings as Mies’s Promontory Apartments at 5530-32 South  Shore Dr. in the Hyde Park neighborhood (built in 1949, listed on the National Register of His- toric Places) exemplify this model of the modern apartment tower.      Mies’s residential skyscraper designs, whether those with steel-and-glass curtain walls or with  exposed concrete structural frames, were enthusiastically embraced and emulated by post-war  American architects, although contemporary critics often commented that few designed as well  or as successfully in these modern styles as Mies himself.  In Chicago, tall apartment buildings  designed in one or the other of these Miesian-influenced modern styles during the 1950s and  1960s can be found in many lakefront neighborhoods, especially the Near North Side, Lincoln  Park, Lake View, Edgewater and Hyde Park.    Other very prominent apartment towers from the post-war period in Chicago include Schipor- reit & Heinrich’s Lake Point Tower (1965), Skidmore, Owings & Merrill’s John Hancock Cen- ter (1969) and Bertrand Goldberg’s Marina City (1960).  Weese’s 227 East Walton Place is  smaller than these heroically-scaled examples, however it is part of an alternative group of  modern apartment designs that stand outside the mainstream, including Loebl, Schlossman &  Bennett’s 1350-1360 North Lake Shore Drive (1948), a slab-like apartment building clad in  brick with window openings that angle out from the façade to capture lake views; and Holsman,  Holsman, Klekamp & Taylor’s series of low-rise cooperative apartments built for working- and  middle-class residents arranged in park-like settings (Winchester-Hood Garden Homes and  Lunt-lake Apartments, both built from 1949-51; and Parkway Garden Homes, built from 1950- 55).      ARCHITECT HARRY WEESE (1915-1998)    The 227 East Walton Place Apartment Building was designed by nationally-significant Chicago  architect and engineer Harry Weese.  Weese was a modern architect who believed in the pri- macy of function and that design could have a positive impact on society.  At the same time he  sought to make modern architecture more humane and textured, by relating it to the past and to  local context, atypical motivations in that profession in the 1950s.       10   "

WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,201 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Homan Avenue, from W. Fifth Avenue to W. Van Buren Street, S. Christiana  Avenue, from W. Jackson Boulevard to W. Gladys Avenue, S. Spaulding Avenue, from W.  Jackson Boulevard to W. Gladys Avenue, W. Gladys Avenue, from S. Homan Avenue to S.  Spaulding Avenue, and W. Jackson Boulevard, from S. Central Park Boulevard to S. Christiana  Avenue.    Reason: The old main consist of 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1888 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main job to  be completed in late May 2015. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Homan Avenue, S. Christiana Avenue, S. Spaulding  Avenue, W. Gladys Avenue, and W. Jackson Boulevard outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.                                             CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN JASON C.

If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  .    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  May 2015. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable  change, we will notify you.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!            "

In August, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin work to  install 2,600 feet of new 24-inch to 42-inch sewer main in S. Calumet Avenue (E. 89th Street  to E. 87th Place) and in S. Eberhart Avenue (E. 89th Place to E. 87th Street). The old sewer  dates back to 1893 and needs to be replaced.     During construction, the eastbound lane of E. 87th Street will be detoured: MLK north, 83rd  east, and Cottage Grove south. One lane westbound will remain open. Otherwise, when we  are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always  be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    9th Ward Office: 773-785-1100    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     "

There were a total  of 35 bids placed during this auction.              The reason this vehicle was decommissioned from the City’s Fleet was due to the following  determination by 2FM:  “The vehicle has roughly 144k miles on it. The shop wrote up a mechanical evaluation of around  $9,000 for parts and labor. The value of the vehicle is $7,600; at this point it's more cost  effective to get rid of the vehicle, than to put the $9,000 into the vehicle.”  It should be noted that the departments providing vehicles and equipment for the online auctions  impart due diligence and subject matter expertise to determine when items are suitable for  salvage. DPS monitors all of the auctions to ensure the City receives fair value for items sold and  the auction Terms & Conditions dictate that the City has the right to withdraw an item from  auction at any time if it is in the best interest of the City.    The Alderman’s second question was: Why is the auction information on the City website show  only auctions through 2006?  The information that was viewed during the DPS budget hearing (see screen shot of link below)  pertained to the live, in-person auctions that were held through 2006; this process predates, and  was replaced by, the online auctions, which reach a far greater audience and require far less  administration/personnel.                   To view a record of closed and current Online Auctions, the following steps should be followed:    Click on the “Online Auctions link (below)…     …it takes you to the Public Surplus page, where you can click on “Current Auctions” or “Closed  Auctions” to view all of the past Online Auctions.          DPS is planning to work with DoIT revamp this part of the City website in order to make this  information easier to find and follow.                  DEPARTMENT  O F PROCUREMENT SERVICES         CITY OF CHICAGO     To:   The Honorable Carrie M.

Hamlin Avenue, from W. Kinzie Street to W. Lake Street.     Reason:  The old main dates back to 1886 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late November 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Hamlin Avenue outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late November  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.                Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!            "

During this period, the Police Board decided or otherwise disposed of no such cases.         Time to Hearing and Decision   After the Superintendent files charges and they are served on the accused officer, the  officer has a right to obtain legal representation, receive discovery, and prepare a defense  to the charges. An evidentiary hearing is then scheduled.     Once a hearing is completed, the members of the Police Board receive and review the entire  record of proceedings in preparation for their monthly meeting. The Board meets in closed  session to consider the case. At the following month’s public meeting, the Board will take  final action on the case and adopt its written findings and decision.     The Board closely monitors the amount of time needed bring disciplinary cases to hearing  and decision. A fair and efficient disposition of each case is an important component of due  process, and keeping delays to a minimum is a priority because the accused officer is  ordinarily suspended without pay when the charges are filed.      The table below shows the median amount of time from the filing of charges to a hearing  and decision.

Appeals of Police Board Decisions      Under Illinois law, the parties to a Police Board disciplinary case (the Superintendent and  the accused officer) have the right to appeal the Board’s decision by filing a petition for  administrative review in the Circuit Court of Cook County.  A party dissatisfied with the  Circuit Court’s review of a Police Board case may appeal to the Appellate Court of Illinois.     The first section below provides data on suits in administrative review during the current  year.  The second section provides historical data on appeals filed since January 1, 2010. As  noted above, a particular case may be reviewed at several levels; in addition, court rulings  may cause the Board to issue more than one decision in the same case. The data on court  decisions in the sections below pertain to the final court decision regarding the Board’s  original decision.    Current Year Data  From January 1 through June 30, 2016, 5 Police Board decisions were appealed to the  Circuit Court of Cook County (all by the accused officers).      Courts issued 4 decisions regarding Police Board cases from January 1 through June 30,  2016, that are considered final*:             In 1 case, the Circuit Court of Cook County affirmed the Board’s decision.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 5,125 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Natchez Avenue (Grand- McLean), in N. Nagle Avenue (Grand-McLean), in W. McLean Avenue (Natchez-Narragansett),  and in W. Palmer Street (Natchez-Narragansett). The old pipe dates back to 1915, and needs to  be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Villegas’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:            BILLIE HOLIDAY   In Washington D.C., the first stone of the Lincoln Memorial was put into place.     The U.S. House of Representatives rejected a proposal granting women the right to vote.      Pluto was photographed for the first time, but not recognized as a planet.    John B. Gruelle was given a patent for his Raggedy Ann doll.    American jazz and blues singer Billie Holiday was born.    The first stop sign appeared in Detroit, Michigan.    Woodrow Wilson became the first President to attend a World Series game.                                              WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will install 5,125 feet of 8-inch water main in  N. Natchez Avenue (Grand-McLean), in N. Nagle Avenue (Grand-McLean), in W. McLean  Avenue (Natchez-Narragansett), and in W. Palmer Street (Natchez-Narragansett).    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1915 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We expect our work to start shortly, and be completed in December. Final restoration  will follow in the spring of 2016. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If  there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in December. Final  restoration will follow in the spring of 2016. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since  we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!      "

By early December 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 673 feet of new 8-inch, 6,825 feet of new 12-inch and  643 feet of new 16-inch water main in E. 47th Street, S. Prairie Avenue to S. Lake Park Avenue and  S. Drexel Boulevard, from E. 47th Street to E. 46th Street. The old water main dates back to 1892,  and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.

We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.

HAIRSTON   773-324-5555   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in early October  2015. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Redevelopment Project Area Information    In July 2010, the Tax Increment Financing (“TIF”) Allocation Redevelopment Act 65 ILCS 5/11-74.4-5-1, et  seq. (“TIF Act”) was amended to require municipalities to assemble a status report covering the history  and  performance  of  TIF  districts  that  have  been  in  existence  for  9  to  10  years.  The  Act  requires  the  report to detail:      1.  The amount of revenue generated within the district;  2.  Expenditures made for the Redevelopment Project Area (“RPA”), including TIF   3.  Status  of  planned  activities,  goals  and  objectives,  including  new  and  planned   fund expenditures;    construction;    4.  The amount of public and private investment within the TIF district; and   5.  Other relevant evaluation or performance data.      The information summarized herein is for the reporting period from the TIF district’s inception through  the  end  of  the  2011  calendar  year  and  the  2010  tax  year.  For  informational  purposes,  certain  other  supplementary information, such as upcoming planned projects, is reported as of December 2012.    Detailed data on the Diversey/Narragansett RPA was compiled to meet reporting requirements under  the  TIF  Act  and  is  presented  in  this  Ten  (10)  Year  Status  Report  (the  “Report”).  The  Report  contains  various  data  from  City  of  Chicago  (“City”)  departments,  including  audited  financial  statements,  Redevelopment  Agreements,  Intergovernmental  Agreements,  capital  improvement  expenditures,  and  TIF-funded  program  databases  (Small  Business  Improvement  Fund,  Neighborhood  Improvement  Program, and TIFWorks) to track financial and programmatic performance. Data sources are referenced  throughout this Report.    Project Area Context and Background    The approximately 154-acre Diversey/Narragansett RPA is located in the Belmont Cragin and Montclare  community  areas  on  the  City’s  northwest  side,  approximately  8.5  miles  from  the  Central  Business  District (“the Loop”). The RPA is roughly bounded by George Street on the north, Fullerton Avenue on  the south, Meade Avenue on the east, and Natoma Avenue and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and  Pacific Railroad on the west. The RPA boundary is shown in Exhibit 1 on the following page.    The RPA was designated as a TIF district on February 5, 2003, and is expected to expire no later than  December  31,  2027.  There  have  been  no  major  or  minor  amendments  to  the  Diversey/Narragansett  Redevelopment  Project  Area  Tax  Increment  Financing  Program  Redevelopment  Plan  and  Project  (the  “TIF Plan”) as of December 31, 2011.        3       City of Chicago      Exhibit 1. Diversey/Narragansett RPA   Diversey/Narragansett TIF District Ten (10) Year Status Report        Conditions at Time of TIF Creation     The RPA was determined to be eligible for TIF designation as a “conservation area” under the TIF Act,  which requires that at least 50 percent of buildings be 35 years of age or older, and three additional  eligibility factors be present to a meaningful extent and reasonably distributed throughout the RPA. The  following eligibility factors were described in the Diversey/Narragansett TIF Plan:     •  76 percent of structures were found be at least 35 years of age or older     The Diversey/Narragansett RPA was designated to foster improvements to the former Brickyard Mall,  Riis Park and an adjacent industrial area, with a primary focus on the mall, which lost three of its four  anchor tenants and saw total sales revenues decrease by approximately 75 percent between 2000 and  2001. Funds are targeted for the rehabilitation of existing buildings and to create job training programs.        4                  •  Factors present to a major extent:   o  Obsolescence  o  Deterioration  o  Excessive land coverage  o  Deleterious land use or layout  o  Environmental clean-up  o  Lack of growth in equalized assessed value (EAV)      •  Minor supporting factors:   o  Dilapidation  o  Presence of structures below minimum code standards  o  Excessive vacancies   City of Chicago      Exhibit 2.

Because of disuse and substantial costs to rehabilitate to  modem standards, the MRl building, the Research building,  and Interns and Residents building are all currently vacant.   Current Zoning:   Residential Planned Development #26   Proposed Zoning:   Same   Environmental Condition:   A Phase I and Phase II was conducted for Parking Lot ""H""  located at 2500 S.  Michigan.  Five anomalies were identified  but soil borings indicated there was no compelling evidence  that the anomalies were associated with USTs or piping.  Several compounds/contaminants were present exceeding  IEPA requirements.  Although no regulations require a No  Further Remediation letter, if desired, a NFR could be  obtained through either active remediation, risk-based  closure, or a combination of both under the IEPA SRP and  in accordance with TACO regulations.   III. BACKGROUND   On October 11,  2005, CDC approved the proposed designation of the 26th  and King Drive Tax  Increment Financing Project Area for the purpose of improving Mercy Hospital and the  development of vacant/blighted land.   Mercy  Hospital  and  Medical  Center  Campus  is  comprised  of four  buildings:  the  Main  hospital  building, the MRl building, the Research building and the Interns and Residents building along with  adjacent surface parking lots.  Due to limited cash flow generation from hospital operations and its  limited debt capacity, Mercy Hospital has been forced to defer several major capital projects and have  been unable to fund ongoing routine capital replacement for their hospital campus. Significant capital  improvement work needs to be done on the main hospital facility such as interior and exterior building  rehabilitation along with replacement and rehabilitation of outdated infrastructure and safety systems.  Over the years, the MRl building and the Research building have fallen into disuse and have become  In  addition,  in  July  of 2005,  the  Interns  and  Residents  building  became  vacant  due  to  vacant.  continued disuse.  The costs to rehabilitate these buildings to modem standards would be substantial.  Therefore, Mercy Hospital intends to sell its parcels just east of Prairie Avenue comprising of the  three vacant buildings and parking lots to a developer for a proposed residential for-sale and senior  housing development.  This would require Mercy Hospital to reconfigure their existing parking lots   to the west of the main hospital building.  This rehabilitation of the Mercy Hospital Campus is long(cid:173) term and multi-phased.  Moreover, the selling of its existing land, reconfiguration of existing parking  lots, and the use ofTIF increment from the proposed redeveloped land will improve Mercy's financial  position  and  allow  them  to  make  critical  investments  in  the  main  hospital's  infrastructure  and  equipment.  Consequently, these actions will  also help to improve Mercy's long-term competitive  position as a hospital.   IV. PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT TEAM   Development Entity: Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, a not-for-profit hospital established in  1852,  is  Chicago's first  hospital and the first  hospital in the State of Illinois.  From its  inception,  Mercy Hospital sponsored by the religious Sisters of Mercy has had an unwavering commitment to  servicing the  economically and  socially  disadvantage  in  its  immediate  neighborhood.  Today the  hospital continues to provide a broad spectrum of health care services to all the diverse communities  it serves.  It is licensed for 477 beds, has 321-available beds and  165-staffed beds.  The hospital has  six ( 6)  ambulatory care facilities in the metropolitan Chicago areas and six ( 6) occupational health  facilities  under  the  name  of  MercyWorks.  Mercy  Hospital  and  Medical  Center  employs  approximately 1,508 full and part-time employees.  As a teaching hospital, Mercy has an affiliation  with the  medical  schools of the University of Illinois  and  Loyola University and  trains over  100  residents per year.  Over 28,000 visits per year are provided to patients who seek care at this Center.  Mercy also has a Family Health Center, which offers clinical, and prescription services to the indigent  within the surrounding communities.  This is all  part of the mission of Mercy's healing ministry.   Consultants: The developer hired Daley & George to assist with the amendment to their Residential  Planned development.  An architect and general contractor will be determined at a later date.   V. PROPOSED PROJECT   Project Overview:  Mercy Hospital &  Medical Center proposes to  1) rehabilitate the interior and  exterior of their main hospital facility,  2) reconfigure portions of the main building and parking lots,  3) acquire and remediate parking lot ""H"", and 4) replace and upgrade clinical equipment as needed.   Major  expenditures  planned  include  hospital-wide  sprinkler  installation,  Energy  Star  window  replacement, building facade repair/renovation, cooling tower replacements and the rehabilitation of  patient care nursing stations, maternity and intensive care/surgery rooms.  Additional expenditures  are  planned  for  a  number  of electrical  and  heating,  ventilation  and  air  conditioning  (HV AC)  improvements,  information/data  infrastructure  upgrades,  and  roof  replacement.  Mercy  will  reconfigure portions of the main building and parking lots and pay site preparation costs for the  portion of the site to be sold for the proposed residential development.  Parking spaces are planned  to be added to the west side of the campus through the reconfiguration and the acquisition of parking  at a nearby church on 26th street.  In addition, the main hospital facility's first floor visitor ingress and  egress will be reconfigured along with the relocation of several departments within the building to  provide direct access from the reconfigured parking.  Mercy has committed to pay a portion of the  site preparation costs for the sale of the eastern portion of their site for the residential development  including building demolition, asbestos removal, and any environmental remediation costs. Mercy sold   nine (9) parcels comprising of parking lot ""H"" to the Sisters of Saint Francis Health in early 2005.  The sales agreement allows Mercy to reacquire the property anytime between April 2005 and April  2009.  Once reaquired, Mercy intends to redesign the parking lot to accommodate additional vehicles.  Also, a Phase I and II indicated the possible need for environmental remediation of Parking lot ""H"".  Mercy has faced increased capital demand due to the growing need to finance information technology  including computerized physician order entry and electronic medical record systems.  Mercy intends  to upgrade their clinical  equipment and  provide  several upgrades for:  information  systems,  radio  equipment, and various furniture,  flooring and wall paper as needed.   Environmental Features:  Mercy Hospital will include but are not limited to energy star windows,  energy efficiency for new HV AC systems, indoor quality improvements, and other sustainable design  and construction for the rehabilitation of the existing hospital.  In addition, Mercy has negotiated with  the proposed residential developer to provide 50% green roof coverage and energy star certification  for all  dwelling units.   VI. FINANCIAL STRUCTURE   The rehabilitation of the Mercy Hospital Campus is long-term and will take place in several phases.  The City, through the Department ofPlanning and Development (DPD), is planning to reimburse the  developer for any TIF-eligible costs from the total project costs, now estimated at $263,151,638.  Payment will be made as a possible combination of a developer note( s) and /or a pay-as-you-go basis  over the remaining life  of the 26th  &  King  Drive TIF District  (2029) for  a total  of $60,897,431,  including  interest.  If a  developer note  is  issued,  the  net  present  value  ('npv'),  which  would  be  approximately $20,785,000,  is  determined  by  discounting annual  stream of payments to 2006 at  approximately 7.5% (interest rate contingent upon market conditions). If the note is issued, it would  not  exceed  95%  of the increment  generated  over the  life  of the  TIF,  which  is  estimated  to  be  approximately $60.9MM.   The City's TIF financial  assistance will  be repaid from incremental tax revenues generated by the  project PIN #s.  Payments will commence after issuance ofDPD Certificate of Completions for the  project, based upon the exhibit in Mercy's application titled 'Mercy Hospital's Capital Expenditures  Cash Flow'. This exhibit, showing their cash flow and  schedule of improvements from 2006-2029,  will be included in the RDA as an exhibit. DPD will require Mercy Hospital to submit their updated  schedule of cash flow and expenditures, annually, by January 3!"" of each year,  and to demonstrate  a  minimum annual expenditure of$7.5mm for improvements listed in the above referenced exhibit.   Developer is entitled to project increment beginning with the year in which the 26th & King Drive TIF  District was established (2006).  Funds generated by project pins before the issuance of the Certificate  of Completion will be set aside for payout.   City will  make  payments  no  later than  either March  I""  or 2  months  from  receipt  of a  complete  requisition for payment for prior calender year (for example, incremental funds from 2006 will be paid  by March 2007, if requested by Jan 2007).   Uses of Funds  Emergency Systems  Exterior  Fire Safety System  HVAC  Interior Systems  Rehabilitation of Patient Care Labs  Reconfiguration of Bldg &  Site Prep  H  Lot Acquisition &  Remediation  Clinical Equipment  Sub Total Project Costs  Capital Expenditures over remaining life of TIF  TOTAL USE OF FUNDS   Sources of Funds  Capital Budget based on Cash from  Operations  TIF Assistance  TOTALSOURCESOFFUNDS   VII.

The  Mayor's Office for Workforce Development (MOWD) has been informed of the project and work  with the developer on job training and placement.   Construction Jobs:  The project will produce approximately 40 temporary construction jobs.   Affirmative  Action:  The  developer will  comply  with the  requirements of Chicago's affirmative  action  ordinance,  which  requires  contract  participation  of 24%  by  minority-owned  business   enterprises  (MBEs)  and  4% by  woman-owned business  enterprises  (WBEs).  The developer  has  provided notification of the proposed project, by certified mail, to eight associations of minority and  women contractors.  A sample  version of the letter and  copies of the post office receipts  for the  certified letters are presented as exhibits to this report.   City  Residency:  The  developer  will  comply with  the  requirements  of Chicago's  city  residency  ordinance,  which requires  that at least half of all  construction-worker hours be filled  by  Chicago  residents.  The developer will also comply with the requirement that all construction jobs are paid the  prevailing wage.   VITI.  COMMUNITY SUPPORT   Alderman Madeline Haithcock endorses the project and has provided a letter of support (see exhibits  for copy).  The project was presented to the community at a meeting held on August  16, 2005  and  was well-supported.  The following community organizations have endorsed the project: Near South  Planning Board.  (See exhibits for copies of support letters).   IX.  CONFORMANCE WITH REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLAN   The proposed project is located in the 26th and King Drive Tax Increment Financing Redevelopment  Project Area.
