In early December, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 987 feet  of new 6-inch water main, 1,346 feet of new 8-inch water main, 2,510 feet of new 12-inch water  main, and 3,308 feet of new 16-inch water main in E. 41st Street (State-MLK Drive), in E. 42nd Street  (Indiana-Calumet), in S. Calumet Avenue (41st Street-43rd Street), and in S. Prairie Avenue  (Pershing-44th Street). The old water main dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    3rd Ward Office: 773-373-9273    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,335 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Evergreen Avenue, from  N. Homan Avenue to N. Kedzie Avenue, and N. Spaulding Avenue, from W. Hirsch Street to W.  Potomac Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1896, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Maldonado’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner    cc:   Alderman Roberto Maldonado                   26th Ward    1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             Do you wonder what was happening in 1896?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                         German physicist Wilhelm Rontgen announced his discovery of x-rays.    The Tootsie Roll was introduced.    The first movie theater opened, charging ten cents for admission.    The modern Olympic Games began in Athens, Greece.    The first car accident occurred, when Henry Wells hit a bicyclist in New York City.    Yosemite became a national park.    ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" was written by John Philip Sousa.                                    EVERGREEN AND SPAULDING AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,335 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Evergreen Avenue, from N. Homan Avenue to N. Kedzie Avenue, and N.  Spaulding Avenue, from W. Hirsch Street to W. Potomac Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1896 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by late March 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Evergreen and N. Spaulding Avenue outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                                            ALDERMAN ROBERTO MALDONADO   3-1-1   773-395-0143   312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  March 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.    Want to learn more?  http://www.cityofchicago.org/watermanagement/bfp             DEPA RTM EN T OF WATER MANAGEM EN T            C ITY  OF CHICAGO    What is MeterSave?    MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

CHICAGO COMMISSION ON HUMAN RELATIONS  Entered: April18, 2012   City of Chicago     COMMISSION ON HUMAN RELATIONS     740 N. Sedgwick, 3rd Floor, Chicago, IL 60654     3I2n44-4111 (Voice), 3I2n44-1081 (Fax), 3I2n44-1088 (TDD)     IN THE MATTER OF:   Nickey McGhee  Complainant  v.  MADO Management, LP  Respondent   Case No.:  11-H-10   Date of Ruling: April18, 2012   FINAL RULING ON LIABILITY   I.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY   On February 8,  2011, Complainant Nickey E.  McGhee filed a Complaint with the City of  Chicago  Commission  on  Human  Relations  alleging  that  Respondent  MADO  Management  LP  (""MADO"")  engaged  in  racial  discrimination  by  refusing  to  allow  him  to  rent  an  apartment.  Complainant McGhee claims that Respondent's actions are a violation of Chapter 5-8-030 of the  Chicago Municipal Code because the refusal to rent was racially motivated.   On  March  11,  2011,  MADO  submitted  a  Response  to  Complaint  denying  that  it  had  discriminated  against the  Complainant because of his  race.  The Commission thereafter entered  and  mailed  on June  30,  2011,  an  Order  Finding  Substantial  Evidence  and  set  the  case  for  an  Administrative  Hearing.  On  September  9,  2011,  an  Order  Appointing  Hearing  Officer  and  Commencing  Hearing  Process  was  mailed  to  the  parties  setting  a  Pre-Hearing  Conference  for  October 21, 2011.   Following  that  Conference,  on  November  7,  2011,  the  Hearing  Officer  entered  and  mailed  to  all  parties  a  Scheduling  Order  directing  the  parties  to  submit  a  Pre-Hearing  Memorandum by November 23,  2011,  and setting the Administrative Hearing for  November 30,  2011.  The parties subsequently submitted Pre-Hearing Memoranda.   The  Administrative  Hearing  took  place  as  scheduled  on  November  30,  2011.  On   approximately December 23, 2011, Respondent submitted a Post-Hearing Brief.   On February  17,2012, the hearing officer issued his Recommended Decision on Liability  and  Damages,  recommending  a  finding  of no  liability  and  informing  the  parties  of the  right  to  submit objections  to  the  recommendation  pursuant  to  Commission Regulation  240.610(b).  No  objections have been received.   II.  FINDINGS OF FACT   1.   MADO  is  the  owner of commercial  and  residential  buildings  including  nursing   homes, various businesses, and a golf course. Tr. 6.   2.  1552-54 N.  LaSalle,  Chicago,  is  a property owned and  managed by MADO.  Tr.  6.  It  has  twenty-five (25) apartment units. Tr.  139.  Some of the units have been combined into single  apartments  from  multiple  apartments  over  the  years.  Tr.  132-139.  Although  the  numbering   1     system  is  1-36,  the  actual  number of apartments  is  only  twenty-five  (25)  because  of those  past  renovations.  Tr.  116-123,  140.  The rooms  are  rented to  men only as  they require  the occupants  to share a bathroom. Tr.130,  132.   3.  In the early part of January 2011, an apartment at  1552-54 N.  LaSalle was available to   rent.  Tr.  124.   4.  On  January  6,  2011,  April  Jacques,  a  receptionist  and  administrator  at  MADO,  prepared  a  Word  document  of current apartment  listings  to  be  signed  by  Ricky  Matuwski,  the  Property  Manager at  MADO,  and  then  faxed  it  to  the  Chicago  Reader on  Saturday,  January  8,  2011, for publication on January  13, 2011. Tr.  70- 72.   5.  The  Chicago  Reader  is  a  weekly  publication  that  contains  classified  advertising  materials  and  new  materials  of all  different kinds  and  is  circulated free  of charge  in the  City of  Chicago and throughout its suburbs. Tr. 73.   6.  On  January  13,  2011,  the  Chicago  Reader  published  the  classified  advertisement   (Resp. Exh. 2) which read:   1552-54  NORTH  LASALLE.  Men  only  rooming  house.  One  room  per  tenant.  Hardwood  floors,  heat,  electricity  are  included.  No  pets.  Month-to-month  lease  agreement $350 per month. One month security deposit. Please call312-787-9400  for viewing and other info.   7.  The  rental  unit  referred  to  in  the  January  13  advertisement  was  apartment  23  (""Unit   23"") and it was  the only apartment then unoccupied and  available at  1552-54 N.  LaSalle. Tr.  74­ 75, Tr.  124.  Unit 23  was a one-room apartment with one sink and one bed. Tr.  140-141.   8.  The  racial  makeup  of the  1552-54  N.  LaSalle  building  occupants  as  of January 26,   2011  was five Caucasians, four African-Americans, and sixteen Hispanics. Tr.  131,  134-5.   9.  On January 20,  2011, Jacques  again  prepared a Word document of current apartment  listings to be signed by Matuwski, and then faxed it to the Chicago Reader on Saturday, January  22,  2011,  for  publication on January  27,  2011.  Tr.  73.  The advertisement  was  the  same as  that  described in paragraph 6.  Resp. Exh. 2.   10.  Mr.  Villegas was a Hispanic male who was  interested in renting Unit 23. Tr. 70.   II.  Sometime after January 13,2011, but before January 24,2011, Villegas viewed Unit   23  through an appointment with MADO. Tr. 84.   12.  On January  24,  2011,  Villegas  came  to  the  MADO  office  and  met  with  Matuwski,  filled out an  application for  Unit 23,  went with Matuwski to  again view  the apartment,  and  said  he would return on January 25,  2011, to pay MADO the security deposit. Tr.  84-85.   13.  On January  25,  2011,  Villegas  returned  to  the  MADO  office  and  gave  Jacques  the  security deposit. Tr.  86.  With the security deposit paid, the apartment was considered by MADO  as  off the market. Tr.  86.  On January 26, 2011, Jacques prepared for Villegas a rental agreement.  Tr.  86-87.  Villegas signed the rental agreement that day. Tr. 87.   2     14.  On January 25,  2011,  Jacques  called another person who  was  interested  in  viewing   Unit 23, told him that the apartment was taken, and cancelled his appointment. Tr.  80,  82.   15.  Complainant Nickey McGhee is  African-American. Comp. Par.  I.   16.  On the  evening  of January  26,  2011,  McGhee  went  to  the  Chicago  Reader's  main  headquarters and acquired a copy of the upcoming issue that was to  be released the next morning  Tr.  15,  74.  McGhee  read  through  the  real  estate  section of the  Chicago  Reader and  saw  the  MADO classified advertisement. Tr.  15-16.   17.  On  the  morning  of  January  27,  2011,  McGhee  called  the  number  listed  in  the  advertisement and spoke  to  a woman he  identified as  Michelle.  Tr.  21,  60.  McGhee made two  calls  to  that  number,  each  lasting  less  than  one  minute.  Tr.  21-22.  Immediately  thereafter,  McGhee went to  1552-54 N.  LaSalle to see  the building.  Tr.  24.  He  testified that he  liked what  he  saw  of the building,  although  the  entrance  was  locked,  and  wanted  the  apartment  because it  was  affordable.  Tr.  24,  26,  27.  He  thereafter  stopped briefly at  the neighboring  cleaners  to  talk  with  a  woman there  about  getting  into the  building before proceeding to  the  MADO office.  Tr.  24, 26, 64.   18.  At  the  MADO  office,  McGhee  introduced  himself to  the  Caucasian  woman  at  the  desk there as  the caller from earlier that morning. Tr. 26.  Upon being asked about 1552-54 rental,  he testified  that the  woman  said  that  ""there's nothing  available.""  Tr.  27.  McGhee  asked  if she  was  sure  because ""the ad just came out,  and  I just called."" Tr.  26-27.  McGhee  claims  that  the  woman then ""said very rudely and abruptly: There's nothing available."" Tr.  27.  McGhee walked  away  feeling,  he  testified,  ""betrayed ...  bitter  and  angry ...  discriminated.""  Tr.  27.  McGhee  says  that  as  a  result  he  lost  time  from  his  work  and  incurred  mental  and  emotional  distress.  Tr.  31.  MADO witnesses testified that it did not employ anyone named Michelle and the only Caucasian  employee who works at the front desk stated she had never seen McGhee. Tr.  94,109.   19.  On  January  27,  2011,  Jacques  prepared  a  Word  document  of current  apartment  listings to be signed by Matuwski, then faxed  it to the  Chicago Reader on Saturday, January 29,  2011,  for  publication  on  February  3,  2011  Tr.  88-89.  The  document  showed  no  available  apartment units at  1552-54 N.  LaSalle. Tr. 89.   20.   In the  first  week of February 2011,  McGhee  returned to  the  MADO  office.  Tr.  29.  The  African-American  woman  at  the  desk,  Jacques,  informed  McGhee  that  there  were  no  vacancies  and instead offered him a list of rentals  in alternate  locations. Tr.  29.  This  list had no  properties  in McGhee's  price range so he  left the office. Tr.  29.  According to Jacques, McGhee  was  asked  if  he  wanted  to  leave  his  name  and  address  in  the  event  there  was  a  subsequent  opening at  1552-54 LaSalle and he declined to do so. Tr. 99-100.   21.  On  November 29,  2011,  MADO  contacted McGhee  and  advised him  it  did  have  a  room  available  at  1552-54  N.  LaSalle.  Tr.  32.  McGhee  declined  to  pursue  this  opportunity  saying ""[I]t's an insult to me after I had to  go through all this .... That would be like going into the  lion's den."" Tr. 32.   III.  APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS   1.  Section 5-8-030 of the Chicago Fair Housing Ordinance states:   3     It  shall  be  unfair  housing  practice  and  unlawful  for  any  owner. .. firm  or  corporation  having  the  right  to  sell,  rent,  lease,  sublease,  or  establish  rules  or  policies for any housing accommodation, within the City of Chicago, or any agent  of any  of these,  or any real  estate broker as  such ...  (C)  to  refuse to  sell,  lease  or  rent, any real estate for residential purposes within the City of Chicago because of  the  race,  color,  sex  gender  identity,  age,  religion,  disability,  national  origin,  ancestry,  sexual  orientation,  marital  status,  parental  status,  military  discharge  status or source of income of the proposed buyer or renter.   2.   In the  Commission of Human  Relations'  Regulations  implementing  the  Chicago   Fair Housing Ordinance, Regulation 420.130 states:   It  is  a violation of the [Chicago Fair Housing Ordinance) for a person to refuse to  sell, rent or lease a dwelling to  a person or to refuse to negotiate with  a person for  the sale,  rental  or leasing of a dwelling because of that person's membership  in a  Protected Class (see Reg.100(26) above).  Such prohibited actions  include, but are  not limited to: ...   (a) 	  Failing  to  accept  or  consider  a  person's  offer  because  of  that  person's   membership in a Protected Class;   (b) 	 Failure  to  sell,  rent or lease a dwelling to,  or failing  to negotiate for  the  sale,  rental  or  leasing  of  a  dwelling  with  any  person  because  of  the  person's  membership in a Protected Class; ...   (c)  Indicating  to  a  person  through  words 	 or conduct  that  the  dwelling  which  is  actually available  for  inspection, sale, or rental has  been sold or rented (or is  otherwise  unavailable)  because  of  the  person's  membership  in  a  Protected  Class; ...   (g) Limiting information to a person by word or conduct regarding suitably priced  dwellings  available  for  inspection,  sale  or  rental  because  of  the  person's  membership in a Protected Class.   3.   Commission Regulation 100(26) defines ""Person"" as:   [O]ne  or  more  individuals,  corporations,  partnerships,  political  subdivisions,  municipal corporations or other governmental units or agencies associations, labor  organizations, unincorporated organizations, trustees in cases under Title 11  of the  United States Code, receivers,  trustees or other fiduciaries,  and any successors or  assigns thereof.   4. 	  Commission Regulation 100(27) defines ""Protected Class"" as:   [O]ne  or  more  of the  following:  race,  color,  sex,  gender  identity,  age,  religion,  disability,  national  origin,  ancestry,  sexual  orientation,  marital  status,  parental  status, military discharge status, or source of income.   4     IV.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW   l.   McGhee  is  a  member  of  a  protected  class  and,  if  denied  housing  by  MADO   because of his race, would be protected by Section 5-8·030.   2.   In  order  to  establish  a  prima  facie  case  of  racial  discrimination,  a  protected  complainant  has  to  show  that  ""the  landlord  knew  of the  complaint's  interest  in  apartment  in  question  and the  landlord ...  rejected  the  person  while  the  property  was  available.  Leadership  Council for Metropolitan  Opera  Communities  v.  Souchet,  CCHR No.  98-A-107  (Jan.  17,  2001)  at  p.  8 [emphasis the decision's].  As  the Commission stated in Lopez v.  Arias,  CCHR No.99-H­ 12,  (Sept.  20,  2000)  at  p.  7:  ""There  can  be  no  discriminatory  refusal  to  rent  when  there  is  nothing available to rent.""   3.   At the  time McGhee  first  made contact with MADO  with  respect to  renting  Unit  23,  that  apartment,  which  was  the  only  available  apartment  in  the  building,  had  already  been  rented.  While it is  possible that he was  mistakenly told that Unit 23  was available on January 27,  2011,  during  one  of  his  two  under-one-minute  telephone  calls,  the  evidence  established  unequivocally that all  units  in  the  LaSalle building were occupied as  of January 25,  2011.  As  a  result, there has been no discriminatory refusal to rent in violation of Section 5-8-030.   4.   There  is  additional  evidence  here  which  buttresses  the  absence  of  racial  discrimination:  the  lack of credibility to  McGhee's  account of his  telephone conversations  with  MADO,  the  racial  composition  of the  tenant  population  at  1552-54  LaSalle,  and  McGhee's  February 2011  refusals to pursue the opportunity of renting a unit at  1552-54 LaSalle.   V. DISCUSSION   McGhee claims that MADO discriminated against him because he was  African-American  when  it  did not allow him to  rent  an  apartment at  1552-54 N.  LaSalle  in January 2011.  In  order  for  McGhee to prevail on this  claim,  as  previously  noted,  he has  to  show  that an  apartment  was  available  to  rent  at the  time he  sought  to  rent  it.  Without  this  basic  starting  point,  there  would  was  no housing for  MADO to deny McGhee because of his race and,  therefore, a refusal  to  rent  because of the race of the proposed renter would have been impossible.   The  undisputed  evidence  demonstrates  that  all  of  the  units  at  1552-54  N.  LaSalle,  including  Unit  23,  had  been  rented  as  of  January  25,  2011.  While  the  Chicago  Reader did  contain  an  advertisement  for  showing  the  availability  of  Unit  23  as  of  that  date,  this  advertisement resulted from  its  placement the  prior week consistent with  MADO's practice and,  no  doubt,  the  Reader's requirements.  It did  not guarantee that an  apartment would be available  on the date of publication and, as  is  true of all such housing advertisements, the seller or landlord  was  free  to rent or sell  the property in  question prior thereto.  That is  what occurred in this case.  Villegas  had  already  rented  Unit  23  and  that  unit  was  off the  market before  McGhee  sought to  rent it.   In light of the foregoing analysis, it is not necessary to  resolve the credibility dispute as  to  the content of McGhee's January 27, 2011, telephone calls to  MADO.  The hearing officer found  McGhee's  testimony  about  those  calls,  however,  to  suspect.  McGhee  asserted  that  MADO's  representative not  only informed him that Unit 23  was  available but, additionally, described that  unit  and  its  ""amenities""  and  provided  him  with  directions  to  the  MADO  office.  The  hearing  officer  found  it  unlikely  that such  a detailed  discussion could have  occurred  in  the  49- and 46­  5     second-long telephone calls reflected on McGhee's phone records.  Moreover, the absence of any  MADO  employee  named  Michelle,  the  failure  of the  only  Caucasian  MADO  desk employee to  recognize McGhee and  the normal  MADO business practices of checking to  insure that a unit  is  available  prior  to  representing  that  it  is  and  only  scheduling  an  apartment  viewing  when  a  MADO  representative  is  available  all  militate  against  McGhee's  version  of  the  January  27  telephone conversations and his subsequent actions that day.   The hearing  offtcer  also  pointed  out  that  the  mixed  racial  composition  of those  persons  renting  apartments  at  1552-54  N.  LaSalle  in  January  2011  as  well  as  MADO's  subsequent  representations to  McGhee that he could rent an  apartment at either 1552-54 N.  LaSalle or at any  other  of  its  rental  locations  provide  additional  considerations  for  finding  that  the  account  of  events  given  by  MADO  witnesses  was  credible  and  that,  accordingly,  there  was  no  racial  animus.   The  Commission  reviews  a  hearing  officer's  proposed  findings  of  fact  pursuant  to  Section  2-120-510(1)  of the  Chicago  Municipal  Code,  which  provides  in  pertinent  part:  ""The  commission  shall  adopt  the  findings  of  fact  recommended  by  a  hearing  officer. .. if  the  recommended findings  are not contrary to  the  evidence presented at  the hearing.""  This  standard  of review  takes  into  account  that  the  hearing  officer  has  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  the  testimony and demeanor of witnesses.  Poole  v.  Perry  &  Assoc., CCHR  No.  02-E-161  (Feb.  15,  2006);  see also  McGee  v.  Cichon,  CCHR  No.  96-H-26  (Dec.  30,  1997).  The Commission will  not  re-weigh  a  hearing  officer's  recommended  findings  of  fact  unless  they  are  against  the  manifest  weight  of the  evidence.  Stovall  v.  Metroplex  et  al.,  CCHR  No.  94-H-87  (Oct.  16,  1996); Wiles  v.  The  Woodlawn Organization et al., CCHR No.  96-H-1  (Mar.  17,  1999).   Here, the Commission finds  that the hearing officer's factual findings  in this case are not  against  the  manifest  weight  of  the  evidence,  and  the  hearing  officer's  conclusions  from  the  evidence are consistent with applicable law.   VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION   In  conclusion,  the  hearing  officer  recommended  a  finding  that  Complainant  Nickey  McGhee  has  not established  by  a  preponderance  of the  evidence  that  MADO  Management  LP  violated the Chicago Fair Housing Ordinance.  The Board of Commissioners accepts  and adopts  the  recommendation  that  Complainant has  not  proved  by  a  preponderance  of the  evidence that  Respondent violated the  Chicago Fair Housing  Ordinance.  Accordingly,  the Commission finds  in favor of Respondent and the Complaint in this matter is  DISMISSED.

In November, the Department of Water Management’s crews will begin the work to install a  new sewer main in S. Perry Avenue, from Marquette to 68th Street. The old sewer dates  back to 1885 and needs to be replaced.     We will require the full and continuous closure of Marquette Road at Perry for about one  week. Traffic will be detoured and signs will be posted in advance.  Otherwise, when we are  working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons.  Outside of working  hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.  You will always be able to reach  your home or business.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    6th Ward Office: 773-635-0006    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.
