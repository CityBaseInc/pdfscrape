This is part of our approach  to renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with  you our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed  about the project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,715 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Cullerton Street,  from S. Racine Avenue to S. Sangamon Street. The old pipe dates back to 1872, and  needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Solis’ office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood  through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the  project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct  ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program  and our Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main  was installed beneath your street. Among other things:                 VICTORIA WOODHULL        Bloomingdale’s department store opened in New York City.    Thomas J. Martin patented the fire extinguisher.    Charlotte Ray, the first African American female lawyer, graduated from   Harvard University.     Arbor Day was celebrated for the first time, in Nebraska.    The Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College began its first academic   session. The university was later renamed Virginia Tech.     Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to be nominated for President of  the United States, although she was a year too young to quality and did not  appear on the ballot.    CULLERTON WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,715 feet of 8- inch water main in W. Cullerton Street, from S. Racine Avenue to S. Sangamon Street.       Reason:  The old main dates back to 1872 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late August 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Cullerton outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in  place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours.  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we  can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN DANIEL SOLIS   773-523-4100                             ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021            FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS     What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If  you have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also  call Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the  voicemail message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside  of our working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the  workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late August  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the  services from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour  notice when this is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old  pipe will break.  They can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If  we do this, we will let you know what is happening, even though we may be unable to  give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be  good neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By  working together, we can complete this important project as friends working for the  improvement of our community.                         DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your  neighbors to reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective  response as the only strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood  basis to work with us on practical steps (public and private) to protect your  property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters  to monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for  only the water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while  protecting one of our most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This  means that with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their  water bills.      Homeowner Incentives         Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:   A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the   meter had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit  www.metersave.org, call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account  number ready.  Space is limited based on funding availability and the number of  volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter  complete with the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of  charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to  Water Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1   place inside the home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount  of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this  limited time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise,  Water Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the  sustainability of our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500  gallons per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household  water consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water  consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This  saves 25 gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers  typically use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in  the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use  by 20-50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use  thousands of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save  money and water by preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45  million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could  face severe water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the  Chicago Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water  from Lake Michigan.               Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!

Harrison.  While the final denial letter references a previous denial letter based primarily   due to law enforcement and deleterious impact bases this final denial was solely based on   the position that the issuance of this tavern license would tend to create a law   enforcement problem.  The applicant filed a timely Notice of Appeal and this matter   proceeded to a de novo hearing before this Commission.  The applicant was represented   by attorney Roderick Sawyer and the City of Chicago was represented by Daniel   Rubinow and Jamie Zehr.           The City presented the testimony of 11th District Police Commander Penelope   Trahanas.  She has been a Chicago Police Officer for 24 years and has been Commander   of the 11th District since August of 2009.        1      In her position as 11th District Commander she received a request for comment on   this application for a liquor license at this location.  In response to this request she wrote   a letter in objection to the issuance of this license.  She identified City’s Exhibit 1, as that   letter she wrote in opposition.          The witness described the 11th District as originally the most violent district in the   city.  It is number one in homicides.  The 3601 West Harrison location is in the   immediate are of a known gang conflict area.  That is an area established by an analysis   group to identify certain areas within the city where there is a high amount of crime and a   high propensity for violence.           The witness detailed several reasons for her opposition to the license.  The first is   that the area has a high number of parolees living in the area.  Two gangs are   continuously involved and outside manpower requests are continuously made to cover   the area.  One block east of the applicant’s location is a liquor store that has issues with   people loitering and hanging out.  She believes a liquor license one block away would   only add to the issues already in the area.  There has not been violence immediately   connected to the liquor store, but the loitering, drug dealing and prostitution are already   issues.  Her concern is that a tavern one block away will exacerbate that issue.  The   issuance of this license would deplete the limited manpower.  The 11th District is already   short on manpower.  Closing time is when traditionally the time for shootings and fights.    As part of her response, she ran statistics that showed in the last quarter of 2009 in that   area there were 27 arrests for narcotics, 13 arrests for soliciting, 2 arrests for unlawful use      2   of weapon, 1 arrest for criminal damage, and one arrest for gambling.  The statistics also   showed an additional 59 calls for service which included shots fired, robberies and other   disturbance calls.          Commander Trahanas opined there was an additional law enforcement problem   with this application because the original application was for a sports bar and grill which   was a misrepresentation and would have had an unsecured area of access.  She is   uncertain if this issue has been remedied.          The Commander testified to a meeting with three community residents who were   concerned with a license issuing because there had been several nights where shots were   fired from the rooftop which concerned them this would be a gang hangout.  The   Alderman also expressed concerns about the attraction this location would become for   gang members.          On cross, Commander Trahanas described the applicant’s location as mostly   industrial with the only business open after 5 o’clock being the liquor store. She does not   believe the reason for the arrests in the area was that the area was abandoned and did not   believe criminals would find it easier to commit crimes in abandoned areas. She does not   consider a bar, a bar licensed by the City of Chicago, to be a reliable business.  A   business which would attract the well-known gang element and the parolees in the area to    come and drink alcohol is not a benefit to her district.  She admitted a McDonald’s is in   the district and that gang members have been arrested at McDonald’s but added      3   McDonald’s does not serve alcohol and gang bangers do not congregate there for long   periods of time.  Commander Trahanas admitted she assumed the gang bangers would   congregate at the applicant’s location.  While the Commander would not agree she is not   in favor of any alcoholic places in the 11th District she could not think of one place that   serves alcohol in the 11th District that she feels is a viable business.  She did admit the   most common call for service was for narcotics and these calls came in both high-traffic   and low-traffic areas.  This area is one of the volatile areas in the district.  This type of   business will attract the negative influences she is trying to remove.  She does not believe   a liquor establishment would attract others from the community and believes there are   wonderful decent people in the 11th District afraid to come out because of negative   influences.  She did admit she did not know if neighbors would support a liquor   establishment.           The Commander repeated her opinion that this establishment would have an   adverse impact on the community and would increase the risk of people violating the law   as well as increase noise and congestion in the area.  She did not do an investigation of   her own into the applicant and the officer holders of the applicant.          On re-direct, Commander Trahanas attributed loitering and violence and police   action to the open liquor store one block from the applicant’s location.  Her opinion is   that if there was no liquor store that activity would go away.  That opinion was based on   precedents of closing liquor stores with the results being an end to loitering in this area.    If there is no license at 3601 W. Harrison there is no place for gang bangers to hang out      4   and less violence.  She did add that there is a fast food location adjacent to 3601 W.   Harrison that is open and has been open.  She cannot recall the hours of operation or if it   is a sit-down restaurant but she believes the people applying for this liquor license   operate that restaurant.  There have been no police issues at that restaurant location.          The Municipal Code of the City of Chicago allows for the denial of an application   for a liquor license if its issuance would “tend to create a law enforcement problem.”    The Municipal Code did not define what this term meant and until recently no case law   discussed its meaning.  In the case of Vino Fino Liquors, Inc. v. The License Appeal   Commission of the City of Chicago, 1-07-3269 (First District – Second Division,   Appellate Court of Illinois).  Justice Theis reviewed the ordinance in its entirety and   stated:                                                                   Examination of the broader context and scheme of this   portion of the ordinance discloses that the City’s intent is   to prohibit the issuance of a license to individuals and   entities controlled or owned by individuals who have a   prior history of disobeying liquor laws and the law in general.    The ordinance requires the applicant to disclose all of the   information so that the LLCC can examine the relevant   individuals’ history to make this determination.  The purpose   of these measures is to promote the City’s goal of protecting   public health and safety (See 235 ILCS 5/1-2 West 2006).    Thus, to deny a license to an applicant who would “tend to   create a law enforcement problem” is to deny a license to an   applicant who would not obey liquor control laws generally   or who would impede enforcement of those laws.    Applying that definition to the facts of this case would require that this   Commission reverse the decision of the LLCC.  This is a de novo hearing and there must   be evidence in the record that would prove the basis for denial.  The evidence in this      5   record from Commander Trahanas does not meet the City’s burden of proof that this   applicant would not obey liquor control laws generally or would impede enforcement of   those laws.          There remains the question of whether the Appellate Court’s ruling limits denial   of an application for a liquor license on the basis that the issuance of the license would   tend to create a law enforcement problem to fact situations in which the City can meet its   burden that the applicant would not obey liquor control laws generally or who would   impede enforcement of those laws.  If that is the law, denial of an application of a liquor   license under this criteria would require specific evidence about the background of the   applicant that would prove the applicant would not obey the law.  It would prevent the   City from ever using this basis to deny an application based on circumstantial evidence   and opinion evidence from law enforcement officials.  The City could never deny an   application based on the type of evidence presented in this case.  With all due respect to   the Appellate Court this Commission feels that the Municipal Code does allow the City to   proceed with a denial of an application on the law enforcement basis without needing to   prove the applicant would tend to break the law.  To require such evidence in all cases   dealing with law enforcement denials would limit the City’s ability to promote its goal of   protecting the public health and safety.           The issue now becomes whether the testimony of Commander Trahanas was   sufficient for the City to have met its burden of proof that the issuance of this license at   this address to this applicant would tend to cause a law enforcement problem.  It seems      6   logical to include within that the term the issue of whether the issuance of this license   would also tend to exacerbate existing law enforcement problems.  Commander Trahanas   has testified about the violence and crime throughout the 11th District and has noted in   her testimony the location of this premise is within a “known gang conflict area.”  She   has testified to problems of loitering in the area of a liquor store located about a block   away and she has given her expert opinion based on 24 years of law enforcement   experience that such problems will move to this location if a license issues.  She also   gave her opinion that the issuance of this license would adversely impact the community,   increase the risk of people violating the law, increase noise and congestion and further   deplete police resources.          One must review this testimony from Commander Trahanas in light of other   testimony that she could not think of one reliable business that serves alcohol in the 11th   District.  While she denied being opposed to all alcoholic places in the 11th District that   concept permeated her testimony at this hearing.  There is probably a basis in fact for the   concept that the issuance of any further liquor licenses in the 11th District would tend to   cause law enforcement problems, but that concept is not a reason to deny a license under   the Municipal Code.          Each applicant case must be scrutinized as to the particular facts of that case.  If   the applicant wishes to open a liquor store as opposed to a tavern that fact would be   important. If the applicant did not have a history of operating a fast food restaurant   around the corner from the site of this premise without any police problems, that fact      7   would be relevant.  If the location of the applicant premises was in an area already   plagued with problems with existing taverns, that would be a relevant fact.  If specifics   were given supporting concerns of increased noise and congestion and depletion of police   patrols were given, such facts would be relevant.          Based on the record in this case and dealing only with the facts of this case in the   record, the City failed to meet its burden that the issuance of this tavern license at this   location to this applicant would tend to cause a law enforcement problem.              The decision of the Local Liquor Control Commission is reversed.    COMMISSIONER SCHNORF’S CONCURRING OPINION       I concur with the decision that the denial of this application is reversed and find   that the Vino Fino case controls this case.                                   8   THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED That the said order or action of the      Local Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago be and the same hereby is     REVERSED.     Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a petition for rehearing may be filed  with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the  mailing of this order is deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an  administrative review action in the Circuit Court, the petition for rehearing must be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order as such petition is a  jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

These appeals are brought before the License Appeal   Commission to challenge revocations, suspensions, or fines of existing liquor licenses by   the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection/Local Liquor Control   Commission.  In these matters, the disciplinary proceedings at the hearing level are   examined, reviewed, and appellate arguments are entertained.  Additionally, our   Commission has reviewing jurisdiction over denials of applications for new liquor   licenses.  Applicants who have been denied their request for a license are entitled to a   trial de novo to determine whether the denial of their application was appropriate.       The License Appeal Commission has collected, through the Department of Finance,   $2,125 in filing fees to date.  The Commission is budgeted for one full-time position.      As always, my office and I will work with the Office of Budget and Management and   members of City Council to continue to lower operation costs and provide savings to the   citizens of Chicago.

Sedgwick, 4th Floor, Chicago, IL 60654  Phone 312-744-4111, Fax 312-744-1081, TTY 312-744-1088  www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations                           SETTLEMENT AND MEDIATION             This publication describes some of the rules and procedures at the Chicago Commission on Human Relations  which  apply  to  settlement  of  cases,  settlement  conferences,  and  mediation.    This  information  does  not  constitute legal advice and is not a full statement of the law and procedure that may apply to a given case.    Commission  Policy.    The  Commission  on  Human  Relations  encourages  voluntary  settlement  of  discrimination cases.  However, no party is ever required to settle or to accept particular terms which may be  discussed.  Parties may always discuss and negotiate settlement on their own if both sides are willing.  In  addition,  authorized  Commission  staff  or  an  independent  mediator  appointed  by  the  Commission  may  facilitate settlement discussions.  If an agreement is reached, there are two possible ways to document the  settlement  so  the  case  can  be  closed.    Partial  settlements  are  possible–such  as  settlement  between  a  complainant and one of several respondents.  The Commission’s regulations about settlement are found in  Subpart 230 and printed at the end of this publication.    Staff-Facilitated  Settlement  During  Investigation.    During  the  investigation  of  a  case,  an  assigned  investigator may ask parties if they are interested in exploring settlement and may facilitate settlement  discussions.  The investigator may arrange for parties to meet together at the Commission’s office if they are  willing.  If a party makes a settlement offer through the investigator, the investigator will communicate the  offer to the other side and seek a response.     Mediators and Mediation.  Mediation (sometimes called conciliation) is a process calling for parties to work  together  with  the  aid  of  a  neutral  facilitator  (mediator  or  conciliator)  who  assists  them  in  reaching  a  settlement.  A Commission mediator is a person appointed to conduct a settlement conference or otherwise  attempt to secure a voluntary settlement.  The mediator is not a Commission employee but may be paid as an  independent contractor.  The mediator does not investigate, serve as hearing officer, or participate in any other  way in the adjudication of the same case.  The mediator’s role is advisory and non-binding, as the resolution  of the dispute rests with the parties themselves.  The mediator is authorized to determine how the settlement  conference will proceed.  See Regs. 100(7), 100(8), and 230.110.    Settlement  Conferences.    The  Commission  decides  whether  it  will  hold  a  settlement  conference  in  a  particular case.  A settlement conference may occur at any time while a case is pending, and parties may  request a settlement conference.  The purpose of a settlement conference is to discuss whether the parties can  agree to settlement terms which resolve the case without need for further investigation or an administrative  hearing.  An independent mediator, appointed by the Commission, will conduct the conference.  The mediator  may  confer  with  the  parties  together  or  individually  in  an  effort  to  help  them  reach  an  agreement.    A  settlement conference is not a hearing, and parties are not expected to present witnesses or other evidence.  No  formal record is made.  See Regs. 230.110 and 230.120.    Settlement Conference Procedures.  If the Commission decides to schedule a settlement conference, it will  mail  a  scheduling  order  to  the  parties.    The  fact  that  a  settlement  conference  is  scheduled  does  not  automatically postpone any filing deadline or other scheduled proceeding (such as a hearing or pre-hearing  conference) in the case, although the Commission can order postponement.   See Reg. 230.110.    Attendance Requirements. Once a settlement conference is scheduled, all parties must personally attend  unless the Commission issues an order making attendance optional.  A person attending for a business party  must have authority to settle.  Participation of persons other than the parties is in the discretion of the  mediator.  If a party fails to attend, or attends without authority to settle, the Commission may impose  procedural sanctions such as default or dismissal, a fine, and payment of the costs of other parties who were  inconvenienced. See Reg. 230.110 and Subpart 235.    Attorney Participation.  Any party participating in a settlement conference may be represented by an   attorney who attends the conference.  The party must also attend unless the attorney provides documentation  of authority to settle on the party’s behalf.  The attorney must have filed and served an attorney appearance  pursuant to Reg. 270.310, either before or at the beginning of the settlement conference.      Rescheduling a Settlement Conference.   If unable to attend a settlement conference for good cause, it is  necessary to seek a continuance as soon as possible, by filing and serving a written motion pursuant to Reg.  210.320(b).  Forms for preparing this motion and documenting service are available from the Commission or  its web site.  Telephoning is not sufficient to excuse a party from attending.  Although a party should  telephone the Commission if a last-minute emergency arises, the call must be followed up with a written  motion establishing good cause for the absence.  In filing or responding to a motion for continuance, parties  are asked to include information about their availability, to assist the Commission in rescheduling.  The  Commission will issue an order, which will set a new date if the motion is granted.  See Reg. 210.320(c).     Confidentiality of Settlement Discussions.  No mediator or Commission staff member may disclose to the  public the content of settlement discussions.  Nothing that is discussed may be used as evidence in any  investigation or hearing on the merits of the complaint.  A mediator will not disclose to other Commission  personnel the content of settlement discussions the mediator has facilitated, unless the parties consent.  See  Reg. 230.120.    Drafting Settlement Agreements.  During the investigation stage of a case, if the parties agree on settlement  terms,  the  investigator  may  agree  to  draft  a  written  settlement  agreement  for  their  signature  and  the  Commission’s approval.  A mediator may be willing to draft a settlement agreement, especially a brief one.   Parties often take care of the drafting and signing of the written agreement themselves.  In that case, the  Commission may issue an order giving them a deadline to submit the settlement document.  Commission  personnel will not draft private agreements which will not be submitted for Commission approval.  Regardless  of who drafts a written agreement, each party signing it must make sure the draft correctly states the terms the  party has agreed to.        Closing a Settled Case.   Once parties have agreed on settlement terms, Reg. 230.130 describes two ways to  close the case or dismiss a settled claim:      ·   Approved Settlement Agreement.   If the parties want the Commission to approve the settlement   and retain jurisdiction to seek court enforcement of it, they must put the settlement terms in writing.   The Commission has a settlement agreement form which parties may use.  The settlement agreement  must be signed by each party agreeing to the settlement.  An attorney may not sign unless the  agreement includes a signed certification or other documentation that the attorney has authority to  sign the agreement for the client.  The signed settlement agreement must then be submitted to the  Commission for approval.  The Commission will issue an order approving the agreement if it is  “knowingly and voluntarily entered into, unambiguously drawn, capable of being enforced, signed by  persons with authority to do so, and consistent with the ordinance.”  The Commission may also  require that a party submit information to allow the Commission to determine ability to comply.   Private Settlement.  If the parties want to keep the settlement terms private, the complainant (or the  complainant’s  attorney)  can  sign  and  submit  a  withdrawal  pursuant  to  Reg.  210.190.    The  Commission has a form which may be used.  On receiving the withdrawal, the Commission will issue  an order dismissing the settled case or claim.  The Commission will not retain jurisdiction to seek  enforcement  of  the  settlement  and  will  not  reopen  the  case  if  the  agreement  was  not  honored.   However, a party may be able to sue in state court to enforce a private agreement as a contract.      ·       Enforcing an Approved Settlement Agreement.   If a party (usually the complainant) believes an approved  settlement  agreement  was  violated,  the  party  may  proceed  independently  (i.e.  without  Commission  involvement) to enforce the agreement under other applicable law.  Typically, the party would file a civil  lawsuit in state court under principles of contract law.  The party may also ask the Commission to seek       2   enforcement of the agreement.  This is done by filing and serving a written motion, and the procedures are  explained in Reg. 230.140, printed below.  The Commission may fine a party for violating an approved  settlement agreement and may ask the City of Chicago Department of Law to file a complaint in state court to  enforce the agreement on behalf of the Commission.  Successful enforcement results in a civil court judgment  for the amount owed (or possibly an order for specific performance).  The Commission does not attempt to  collect or execute any judgment issued in favor of a party other than the Commission itself, although the party  can proceed independently.           Part 100    (7)   COMMISSION REGULATIONS ABOUT SETTLEMENT AND MEDIATION   “Conciliation” or “Mediation” is a process calling for parties to work together with the aid of a neutral  facilitator–a conciliator or mediator–who assists them in reaching a settlement.  The concilator or mediator’s  role is advisory and non-binding, as the resolution of the dispute rests with the parties themselves.  Where used,  “conciliation” and “mediation” have the same meaning.   General Definitions     (8)   “Conciliator”  or  “Mediator”  means  a  person  designated  by  the  Commission  to  conduct  a  settlement  conference  or  otherwise  attempt  to  secure  a  voluntary  settlement,  but  who  does  not  participate  in  the  investigation, serve as hearing officer, or in any other respect participate in the adjudication of the same case.   Where used, “conciliator” and “mediator” have the same meaning.      Settlement Conference Procedure   Settlement Policy and Settlement Conference     Reg. 230.100    It is the policy of the Commission to encourage the voluntary settlement of complaints, although the Commission shall  not require settlement or particular settlement terms.  Any authorized Commission staff member may facilitate settlement  discussions and draft a settlement agreement reflecting agreed terms for the parties to sign.  The Commission may also  hold a settlement conference pursuant to Reg. 230.110 in an attempt to secure voluntary settlement.    Reg. 230.110    The  Commission  may  schedule  a  settlement  conference  conducted  by  an  independent  mediator  appointed  by  the  Commission.  Unless otherwise agreed by all participating parties, such a settlement conference shall occur no sooner  than 14 days after the date of mailing the scheduling order.  A scheduled settlement conference does not stay proceedings  or constitute an extension of time for any filing unless so ordered.  The mediator shall confer with the parties in an  attempt to secure a voluntary settlement of the complaint.  The mediator is authorized to determine how the conference  shall proceed.  A settlement conference is a scheduled proceeding at which attendance of all parties is mandatory unless  otherwise ordered, and each party must have at least one person in attendance who has authority to settle.  Each party  may be represented by an attorney of record; however, attendance of an attorney only is not sufficient unless the attorney  provides documentation of authority to settle on the party’s behalf.  Participation of additional persons in a settlement  conference is in the discretion of the mediator.  If a party fails to attend a settlement conference or attends without  authority to settle, the Commission may determine what if any sanction is just and proper among the options set forth in  Subpart 235.     Reg. 230.120    Neither a mediator nor the Commission shall disclose publicly the content of any settlement discussions concerning a  Commission case.  No stenographic or other formal record shall be made of settlement efforts at a settlement conference  or elsewhere.  Neither party may use the fact that an offer was made, accepted, or rejected at a settlement conference or  during other settlement discussions as evidence during the investigation or administrative hearing concerning the merits  of the claim under discussion.   Nondisclosure of Settlement Discussions        3   Retained Jurisdiction   No Admission of Violation   Private Settlement   Approved Settlement Agreement   Closure of a Case by Settlement   Reg. 230.130    Parties may settle a claim or complaint either by approved settlement agreement or by private settlement as the parties  may agree.  Settlement closure procedures are as follows:    (i)    If the parties agree to a settlement which they want the Commission to approve with retained jurisdiction to seek  enforcement, the settlement terms must be reduced to writing, signed by the parties, and submitted to the Commission for  approval.  Attorneys may not sign a settlement agreement on behalf of a client unless the attorney or the client includes  with the agreement a signed certification or other documentation that the attorney has authority to sign the agreement on  the client’s behalf.  If the proposed settlement is knowingly and voluntarily entered into, unambiguously drawn, capable  of being enforced, signed by persons with authority do to so, and consistent with the ordinance, the Commission shall  issue an order approving the settlement and dismissing the settled claim or complaint.  The Commission may require as a  condition of approval that any party to a settlement submit such information as the Commission deems necessary to  determine ability to comply.  If the Commission does not approve the settlement, it shall order further appropriate action.    (j)    The Commission shall retain jurisdiction over the case to seek enforcement of an approved settlement agreement as  described in Reg. 230.140.    (k)    Entering into an approved settlement agreement or private settlement is not an admission by any party as to whether an  ordinance violation was committed.    (l)    If the parties agree to a settlement which they want to remain private (i.e., not approved by the Commission), in order for  the Commission to close the case or dismiss the settled claim, the complainant must sign a withdrawal of the complaint or  claim as set forth in Section 210.190.  The Commission shall not retain jurisdiction to seek enforcement of any private  settlement agreement.    Reg. 230.140    If a party believes there has been a violation of an approved settlement agreement, the party may proceed independently  to enforce the agreement under any applicable law.  If the party wishes to invoke the Commission’s retained jurisdiction,  the party must file a motion for enforcement and serve it on all other parties, stating the nature of the alleged violation.   All other parties shall have 14 days from filing of the motion to file and serve a response, unless the Commission issues  an order allowing additional time.  The Commission may conduct an investigation into the alleged violation and may  issue any orders it deems necessary to exercise its retained jurisdiction.  If the Commission finds substantial evidence that  a party has violated the terms of an approved settlement agreement, the Commission shall promptly notify the parties in  writing, may fine any noncompliant party, and may request the Department of Law to seek judicial enforcement in state  court on behalf of the Commission.  If the Commission concludes that substantial evidence of violation of the agreement  is lacking, it shall notify the parties in writing.       Noncompliance with Approved Settlement Agreement        4

In mid-April, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin work to  install a junction structure at the intersection of Pulaski and 60th Street. Following, our in- house crews will install a new sewer in 62nd Street (Hamlin-Lawndale), in Lawndale  Avenue (63rd Street-61st Place), in 60th Street (Pulaski-Springfield), and in Springfield  Avenue (59th Place-61st Street). The old sewer dates back to 1910 and needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    13th Ward Office: 773-581-8000    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner
