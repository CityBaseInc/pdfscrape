This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,980 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Lawndale Avenue, from  W. Fullerton Avenue to W. Dickens Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1900 and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Colón’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s about the time the old water main was  installed beneath your street.  Among other things:           HAMBURGER      •  Hawaii became a U.S. territory.  •  The hamburger was created by Louis Lassing in Connecticut.  •  Actor Spencer Tracy was born.  •  The U.S. Navy’s first submarine made its debut.  •  The second modern Olympic Games opened in Paris, and lasted for 5 months.  •  L. Frank Baum wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.  •  The first electric bus became operational in New York City.  •  English handwriting experts established the art of calligraphy.                                        LAWNDALE AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,980 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Lawndale Avenue, from W. Fullerton Avenue to W. Dickens Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consist of a 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1900 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late July 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Lawndale Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   ALDERMAN REY COLÓN   773- 365-3535   312-742-1021                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July 2013.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:   (cid:153) A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.    (cid:153) Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,    (cid:131)  (cid:131)  water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)  (cid:131)  outdoor water conservation kit or  (cid:131)  (cid:131)  And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:   (cid:153)  Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.  (cid:153)  Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.  (cid:153)  Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.  (cid:153)  Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.  (cid:153)  If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.  (cid:153)  Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.  (cid:153)  Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.  (cid:153)  Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.    (cid:153)     WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

Sedgwick, Suite 400, Chicago, IL 60654      Phone 312/744-4111, Fax 312/744-1081, TTY 312/744-1088   www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations   MILITARY STATUS DISCRIMINATION   FAQ   Chicago has amended its Human Rights and Fair Housing Ordinances to address discrimination targeting  current  and  former  members  of  the  military.    Effective  March  16,  2016,  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  military status will be prohibited in the City of Chicago in all areas under the Commission’s jurisdiction:  employment, public accommodations, credit transactions, bonding and housing.  This protection includes  discrimination  targeting  individuals  on  the  basis  of  his/her  military  discharge  status  and  extends  to  individuals  who  are  on  active  duty,  or  in  any  reserve  component  of  any  branch  of  any  state  or  Federal  armed forces, or a veteran thereof.     1.  What is considered “Military Status?”     A person will be able to claim military status protection if he or she is on active duty or in the reserves of  any branch of any state or federal armed forces.  This protection also extends to veterans of any of these  branches.  Lastly, any person who has been a target of discrimination based on his/her military discharge  status can also claim protection under this category.     2.  Do  the  new  protections  require  employers  to  give  preference  to  applicants  based  on  their   military status?   No,  the  new  protections  do  not  require  employers  to  give  preference  to  applicants  on  the  basis  of  their  military status.  However, employers who  have adopted a veteran’s preference hiring policy  must apply  their policy fairly and consistently.     3.   If an employee has disruptive Post Traumatic Stress Disorder episodes in the workplace, is the  employer required to ignore it?   No.    An  employer  should  treat  any  apparent  manifestation  of  PTSD  like  any  other  potential  disability- related need of an employee and pursue the proper course of action under its reasonable accommodation  policy.   4.   Is an employer required to save the position of a service member employee while the employee  is deployed for training or active duty?   The military status protections recently enacted by the City do not include any reemployment obligations.   However, employers should be aware that there are Federal and State laws which impose reemployment  obligations upon employers as well as the accrual of seniority and benefits during this time.       5.  Under the Fair Housing Ordinance,  are landlords prohibited from refusing to  rent  to service   members who may be deployed during the duration of the lease agreement?   Yes.  Landlords cannot refuse to rent to military service members simply based on a possibility that they  will be deployed during the duration of the lease.  However, if deployment happens during the lease term  and appropriate notice is given to the landlord, the landlord must be willing to terminate the lease without  penalty if the service member cannot arrange for continued rent payments during such deployment.   6.  Are landlords prohibited from refusing to rent to applicants who intend to use their G.I. Bill to   pay for housing?   Yes.    The  G.I.  Bill  constitutes  a  lawful  source  of  income  and  should  be  accepted  as  a  valid  form  of  payment to cover housing expenses.     7.  May a landlord refuse to rent to a military service member if the landlord is from a country   that the United States military has occupied or invaded?   No.  A landlord may not refuse to rent to a military service member based on the fact that the person is a  member of the military, irrespective of any socio/political objection to U.S. military involvement.     8.  Are  former  service  members  still  protected  under  these  new  provisions  if  they  were   dishonorably discharged from the military?    Yes.    The  fact  of  discharge  from  the  military,  whether  honorable  or  not,  does  not  impact  the  anti- discrimination protections.     9.  Are current or former service members required to have served in the military for a specific   length of time in order to have the military status anti-discrimination protections?   There  is  no  requirement  that  someone  serve  a  minimum  amount  of  time  in  the  military  before  being  entitled to military status protections.    10.  Would  the  protections  cover  military  service  members  from  branches  of  service  in  other   states?  What about other countries?   The military status protections under Chicago’s discrimination ordinances extend to any service member  of any branch of the military in any state in the United States, but do not include military personnel from  other countries.   11.  Who is going to enforce the new City law?   The Chicago Commission on Human Relations (CCHR) is charged with enforcing this law.   12.  How can a person file a complaint under this new law?   Within 180 days of the alleged discrimination, individuals claiming discrimination based on this, or any  other recognized, basis may appear in person between the hours of 9 AM and 3 PM at the Commission on  Human Relations (740 N. Sedgwick, 4th floor) to have a neutral staff member assist with the filing of the  complaint.  information,  see  http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cchr/supp_info/file_a_discriminationcomplaint.html.      Alternatively,  complaints  may  be  mailed   in.     For  more   13.  What are the penalties for violating the new City law?   Any person or entity who violates any of the provisions of the new law may be fined not less than $100  and  not  more  than  $1,000  for  each  offense.  Additionally,  violations  of  the  law  may  result  in  damages  awarded  to  the  successful  complainant,  payment  of  complainant’s  attorney  fees  and  costs,  injunctive  relief, as well as business license discipline for the respondent in question.

An attorney-at-law, and the employees of an attorney-at-law, who is a tax preparer; 2.	A certified public accountant, and the employees of a certified public accountant, who is a tax preparer; 3.  An  officer  or  employee  of  a  federal,  state,  or  local  governmental  agency  who  provides  tax  preparation services in the scope of his employment; or 4.	 An  administrator,  conservator,  guardian,  executor,  trustee,  receiver  or  other  representative  appointed by the court who provides tax preparation services in the scope of that appointment.  •	 Check	the	Preparer’s	History.	 Check with the Better Business Bureau to see if the preparer has a   questionable history and how they are rated.   •	 Make	Sure	the	Preparer	is	Available.	 Make sure you will be able to contact the tax preparer after  you file your return, even after the April 15 due date. This may be helpful in the event questions  arise about your tax return.   •	 Avoid	Large	Refund	Claims.	 Be wary of any preparers who claim they can obtain larger refunds   than other preparers.   •	 Check	the	Preparer’s	Qualifications.	All paid tax return preparers are required to have a Preparer   Tax Identification Number from the IRS.  •	 Know	Your	Rights.	Avoid preparers who don’t provide you with an estimate of the cost of services  and a Consumer Bill of Rights before you use their services. A copy of the Consumer Bill of Rights  can be found in English and Spanish at www.cityofchicago.org/BACP.  •	 Find	a	Free	Tax	Preparer.		The City of Chicago has partnered with the Center for Economic Progress and  Ladder Up to support eligible families and individuals who cannot afford professional tax preparation  services. Visit www.taxprepchicago.org to find the nearest free tax preparation site.  Report	abusive tax preparers to Business	Affairs	and	Consumer	Protection	  by calling	311 or visiting	www.cityofchicago.org/BACP.   @ChicagoBACPCityofChicago.org/BACPDepartment of Business Affairs and Consumer ProtectionCity Hall, 121 North LaSalle Street, Room 805, Chicago, IL 60602Be careful when selecting a licensed tax preparation business to prepare your tax return.
