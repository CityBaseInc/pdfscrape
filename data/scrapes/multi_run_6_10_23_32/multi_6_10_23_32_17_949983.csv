Starting in early February, the Department of Water Management’s crews will install a new  sewer main in W. Chase Avenue, from Clark to Paulina. The old sewer dates back to 1955  and needs to be replaced.     This project includes making a connection to the existing sewer at the intersection of Chase  and Clark and as such, the full and continuous closure and detour of Clark is required for a  few days. Otherwise, when we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety  reasons, but you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working  hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    49th Ward Office: 773-338-5796    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner

Board Members   There are indications from the Mayor’s Office that an appointment of two new members  is imminent.     I am also pleased to announce that Pastor Mary Carr has been re-appointed for a full 4- year term, expiring July 31, 2019.      Education-Classes    Staff continues to work with the Department of Innovation & Technology (“DOIT”) to  replace the system for scheduling people for 4-year classes. The requirements document  was submitted to DOIT in early May, and we met with the programmers on June 8 and   Open Session Minutes  June 24, 2015  Page 2     will again meet with them on June 29.  We aim to have the new system running by the end of  2015.     Twelve employees attended classes May 28 and June 9; nine (9) are scheduled for class on July  7.    On June 4, the Executive Director participated in a panel discussion on Ethics for Government  Attorneys,  together  with  representatives  from  the  Attorney  Registration  and  Disciplinary  Commission and the John Marshall Law School.    On June 10, staff conducted a class for the 48th Ward staff, and on June 26 will conduct a class  for the 15th Ward.    On June 23, staff conducted a program for senior City Council staff (especially Chiefs of Staff).   50 employees attended.    On July 13, staff will host a delegation of anti-corruption officials from Kyrgyzstan.    The Executive Director was invited to serve as a panelist on organizational ethics at the Annual  Meeting and Conference on Teaching and Learning of the American Accounting Association in  Chicago.  The presentation would be on Sunday, August 9.      Staff is scheduling several classes for all other  City Council staff employees and independent  contractors.      C.                      D.                       To  date,  all  but  one  (1)  employee  and  six  (6)  appointed  officials  required  to  file  their  2015 Statements of Financial Interests by June 1 have filed.  As per the Ordinance, the  Executive Director has determined that 31 employees and 34 appointed officials violated  the Ordinance by failure to file by that deadline. Of these, 4 were assessed fines of $250  per  day,  and  the  remaining  seven  (7)  non-filers  continue  to  accrue  a  $250  daily  fine.   Staff  notified  all  late  filers  and  will  notify  their  department  heads  (and  the  Office  of  Legislative  Counsel  and  Governmental  Affairs)  next  week.  The  names  of  all  filers  determined  to  have  violated  the  Ordinance  will  be  posted  on  the  Board’s  website  beginning on July 1.   2015 Statements of Financial Interests    On-line Training     To date, 497 lobbyists have completed the 2014-2015 lobbyist program.  Their deadline  is June 30. Reminders were sent on June 1 and June 15.   To  date,  14,250  employees  have  completed  the  2015  mandatory  education  program.  Their deadline is December 31, 2015.  Staff released a DVD version of the training to  those departments that have requested it, to enable them to ensure that employees without  computer access complete the training by the deadline. The aldermanic version will be  released in August.   Open Session Minutes  June 24, 2015  Page 3   Ongoing Investigative Record     E.                F.            G.

We continue to post, on the Board’s website, the ongoing investigative record, showing  the status of every completed investigative report brought to the Board by both inspectors  general  since  January  1,  2012,  and  the  status  of  every  petition  to  commence  an  investigation brought to the Board by the Legislative Inspector General.  The record is  consistent with the confidentiality provisions of the Ordinance.   Lobbyists-regulation and enforcement   Currently, 575 lobbyists are registered for 2015, and the agency has collected $297,751 in  lobbyists’  registration  fees.  On  June  23,  we  sent  notices  reminding  lobbyists  of  the  upcoming July 20 deadline to file their quarterly reports.    Lobbyists—Inspector General Audit   The  auditing  personnel  in  the  IG’s  office  met  with  staff  on  June  11,  and  are  nearing  completion  of  their  tentative  audit  report.    They  presented  their  tentative  conclusions.   Some  included  helpful  suggestions,  others  would  appear  to  require  amendments  to  the  Ordinance, and still others appear to be based on a reading of the Ordinance with which  professional staff disagrees.   Summer Student Interns   We are pleased that we will be hosting two high school students, one in an unpaid and the  other in a paid internship, beginning June 29 and July 6, through August 7.  Our paid  intern is participating through a program that is managed by ASPIRA,  Inc. of  Illinois,  which is our Board member Daisy Lezama’s employer; our unpaid intern is participating  through the City’s Department of Human Resources.   Proposed Amendments to the Ordinance   At  last  week’s  City  Council  meeting,  a  package  of  amendments  to  the  Ordinance  was  submitted to the City Council.  If necessary, the Executive Director will appear before the  Council’s Committee on Rules & Ethics to answer questions about the proposal, prior to  the next City Council meeting, scheduled for July 29.   Advisory Opinions     Since the May 2015 meeting, the agency has issued 307 confidential informal advisory  opinions (in addition to those formal opinions issued or approved by the Board).     •     •        The leading categories in this period (in descending order) were: travel, gifts, the   reverse revolving door, post-employment, and lobbying.   49%  of  these  were  from  City  employees  in  administrative  or  management  positions,  13%  from  non-administrative  or  managerial  employees,  18%  from  lobbyists, 1% from City other government agencies, 4% from department heads,   Open Session Minutes  June 24, 2015  Page 4                                  K.

IV.          7%  from  City  elected  officials  (or  aides  calling  on  their  behalf),  6%  from  City  appointed officials, and the remainder from members of the public, vendors, and  the media.   •   •           52% came via email; 47% via telephone; the remainder via walk-ins.   Employees or officials from nearly every City department (including the City   Council) are represented, with the most numerous ones, in descending order,   coming from employees or official in: City Council, Office of the Mayor, Chicago  Public Library, Public Health, Police, Law, and Buildings.   Staff met with programmers from the Department of Innovation & Technology on June  17 regarding a on a “beta” version of a secure, searchable database for all such informal  advisory  opinions.    This  will  enable  Board  staff  to  receive  instantaneous  reports  of  opinions issued by topic, department, title, date, etc. We will test this version beginning  in early July. It is being developed without additional cost to the City or the Board.   2016 Budget   The  agency’s  2016  budget  appropriation  request  is  due  on  July  10.    We  anticipate  no  increases  from  last  year’s  budget,  and  are  looking  at  ways  to  cut  the  non-personnel  budget by several thousand dollars.  The agency’s 2015 appropriation is $798,000.   Freedom of Information Act    Since  the  last  regularly  scheduled  Board  meeting,  the  office  has  received  one  (1)  new  request  under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act.  It  sought  seven  (7)  named  FOIA  requestors’ FOIA requests on certain dates to the Board, and our responses. We located  responsive  records,  and,  after  making  required  redactions  (on  the  advice  of  the  Law  Department), sent the responsive records to the requestor.   OLD BUSINESS           V.

Sawyer’s (6th Ward) request, I am providing you with information  regarding a water construction project in your neighborhood. This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,312 feet of 8-inch water main in E. 74th Street, from S.  Cottage Grove Avenue to S. Ingleside Avenue, S. Ingelside Avenue, from E. 74th Street to E. 75th  Street, S. Drexel Boulevard, from 380 feet North of 74th Street to E. 75th Street, and S. Ellis  Avenue, from 350 feet North of E. 75th Street to E. 75th Street. The old pipe dates back to 1891,  and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Sawyer’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:            Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap   and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.                                      74TH, INGELSIDE, DREXEL AND ELLIS WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,312 feet of 8-inch  water main in E. 74th Street, from S. Cottage Grove Avenue to S. Ingleside Avenue, S. Ingelside  Avenue, from E. 74th Street to E. 75th Street, S. Drexel Boulevard, from 380 feet North of 74th  Street to E. 75th Street, and S. Ellis Avenue, from 350 feet North of E. 75th Street to E. 75th  Street..    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1891and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by late January 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on E. 74th Street, S. Ingelside Avenue, S. Drexel  Boulevard, and S. Ellis Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the  street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your  home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a  lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                                                 ALDERMAN RODERICK T. SAWYER   3-1-1   773-635-0006   312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  January 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

Both  projects  involve  programs  created  by  [I]  under  City  contracts  still  active,  and  project  team  members  are  able  to  make  decisions  or  take  actions  affecting  [l's]  contract  and  ongoing City business.  This letter confirms our conversation of January 31,  2003,  in  which  we  advised  you  of  Board  staff's  conclusion  that,  because  each  team  member is  in  a position  to  affect [l's]  City  business,  pursuant to§§ 2-156-040  (b)  and  (c)  of  the  Ordinance,  so  long  as:  1)  the  value  of  the  dinner  to  each  City  employee comes to  less than  $50;  and  2)  the dinner offer is  not made or accepted  based on  any mutual understanding that team members' official actions,  decisions  or judgments concerning [l's] City business would be affected by the offer, then the  Ordinance  neither  prohibits  [I]  from  making  this  offer,  nor team  members  from  accepting it.   Our conclusion  regarding  this  offer is  based  solely on  the  application  of the  City's  the  facts  presented;  other  laws,  rules,  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  to  regulations or policies may apply to the  situation.  If any of the  facts  stated  in  this  letter are  inaccurate or incomplete,  please  inform  us  immediately,  as  any  change  could alter our conclusion.

We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Ariel Reboyras                     30th Ward    1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1               Do you wonder what was happening in 1907? That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                         For the first time, a ball dropped in Times Square in New York to signal the new year.    President Theodore Roosevelt shook a record 8,513 hands in one day.    The first cabs with taxi meters began operating in London.    Finland became the first European country to give women the right to vote.    The automatic washer and dryer were introduced.    Oklahoma became the 46th State.    Actor John Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa.                                               LAWNDALE WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,028 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Lawndale Avenue, from N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Milwaukee Avenue     Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1907 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late October. Restoration will follow in late November. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Lawndale outside of our working hours.  When we are  working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able  to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN ARIEL REBOYRAS   773-794-3095      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late October.  Restoration will be completed in late November. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

CHAIR’S REPORT            III.     EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT   A.   Education     Classes and Other Presentations    Since the last Board meeting, 114 employees and officials attended classes held on  December 20 and January 5, 12 and 17.  Staff also conducted a class for the City Clerk  appointee and her Senior Staff on January 12.  There are 129 scheduled for upcoming  classes on January 19 and 26, and February 2, 7 and 16.     On January 19, staff will conduct a class for members of the Commission on Animal  Care and Control, at the request of its Chair.   On February 23, staff will conduct two classes for SSA Commissioners and Service  Provider representatives.   On January 11, at the request of Chair Bill Conlon, the Executive Director and Legal  Counsel made a 25 minute presentation to the Public Affairs Committee of the Union  League Club; the Chair himself was unable to attend.     Open Session Minutes  January 18, 2017  Page 2      On February 14, staff will make a 60 minute presentation to a group of anti-corruption  officials from Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Territories, at the  request of World Chicago and the Mayor’s Office.   On-line Training   As will be reported in greater detail in closed session, on January 4, 2017 the Executive  Director issued 12 probable cause notices to 11 employees and one (1) alderman who  had not completed the 2016 annual mandatory ethics training course as required.   Eight (8) of these have resulted in determinations that the individuals violated the  Ordinance, but no fines will be assessed as they completed it prior to the fine period  taking effect.  As required by law, their names and violations will be posted on the  Board’s website.   A total of 31,159 officials and employees completed the training.  The astoundingly low  number of persons (12) who did not comply with the Ordinance’s deadline is a  testament to the dedication of Board staff, particularly Ed Primer, Doretha Jackson, and  Ana Collazo, and the network of ethics liaisons we have in every department and  aldermanic office.   The 2016-2017 mandatory lobbyist training will be posted, closely coinciding with the  annual lobbyist registration deadline of January 20.   New Educational Materials   All Board educational materials have been fully revised, though, as will be discussed in  closed session, there are further revisions to be made to the “Plain English Guide to  Being Lobbied,” for City employees and officials.       Since the last Board meeting on December 19, 2016, staff has issued 164 informal opinions  (three (3) others are being presented today, pending Board approval). During this time, the  leading categories were, in descending order: travel, gifts, travel, campaign financing, use of  City property/authority*; post-employment, and outside employment.  The leading City  departments from which requesters came in this period were (in descending order): City  Council, Chicago Police Department; Mayor’s Office; Department of Aviation; Department of  Public Health; Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events; and Department of  Finance.  75 of these were from City employees in administrative or management positions; 24 from  non-administrative/managerial employees; 17 from eight (8) individual department heads;  24 from City elected officials (including 13 individual aldermen); four (4) from aldermanic  Chiefs of Staff or staffers calling on behalf of the alderman; two (2) from ethics officials in  other agencies; two (2) from former City department heads; and the remaining 16 from: five  (5) lobbyists, two (2) City appointed officials, six (6) from contractors or vendors; the rest  came from the public and the media (these last are not actually advisory opinions).   50% came via email; 49% via telephone; the remainder via walk-ins.   Several informal opinions of note will be discussed in closed session.     Advisory Opinions    B.      C.   E.      Website Modifications/Advisory Opinions   Open Session Minutes  January 18, 2017  Page 3  *At the recent COGEL (Council on Governmental Ethics Laws) conference, we learned that  this topic was the leading topic of investigations reported by state, county and municipal  ethics commissions with investigative authority between November 2015 and November  2016.     All formal Board opinions are now posted on the Board’s website, in accordance with the  Ordinance’s confidentiality provisions.  Further, summaries and keywords for each of these  opinions are available on the Board’s searchable index of opinions.  There are only a handful  of other ethics agencies that have comparable research tools.   We are unaware of jurisdictions that make their informal opinions public—though there are  others who issue them confidentially and enable requesters to rely on them in the event of  an investigation or enforcement procedure.   Staff is nearing the completion of the next phase: to publish reports of the investigations  conducted by the Board of alleged violations of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance (not of  the former Campaign Financing Ordinance) between 1987 and 2013.  The investigations  themselves are confidential, but the Board is authorized to publish summary reports of its  investigations, findings and recommendations (and has done so in the past). There are  approximately 45 of these.      We continue to post on the Board’s website an ongoing investigative record showing the  status of every completed investigative report brought to the Board by both the Inspector  General (“IG”) (a total of 2 since July 1, 2013) and the former Office of the Legislative  Inspector General (“LIG”), since January 1, 2012, and the status of all 50 petitions to  commence investigations that were presented to the Board by the former Office of the  Legislative Inspector General. It is updated as appropriate, consistent with the Ordinance’s  confidentiality provisions. However, as there have been no completed investigative reports  sent to the Board in nearly one full year, there has been little to update.       July 2013 amendments to the Ordinance provide that, when a person seeks advice from the  Board about past conduct, and discloses to the Board facts leading it to conclude that he or  she committed a past violation of the Ordinance, the Board must determine whether that  violation was minor or non-minor.  If it was minor, the Board, by law, sends the person a  confidential letter of admonition.  If it was non-minor, then, under current law, the person is  advised that he or she may self-report to the inspector general or, if he or she fails to do so  within two weeks, the Board must make that report.     Since the time this provision (§2-156-070(b)) became effective, the Board has advised three  (3) aldermen, one (1) aldermanic staffer, and two (2) department heads or former  department heads that their past conduct violated the Ordinance. In 3 of these 5 cases, one  involving an alderman, the second an aldermanic staffer, and the third a former department   Disclosures of Past Violations   D.

Lobbyists-Regulation and Enforcement   2017 Statements of Financial Interests     head, the Board concluded that the apparent violations were not minor or technical, and the  individuals self-reported to the respective inspector general.  To date, we have received no  reports of commenced investigations (in the case of the former LIG) or completed  investigations (from either the IG or LIG) of any of these matters. In the other cases, the  Board sent confidential letters of admonition, as required by Ordinance. There is no legal  requirement imposed on the IG to report back to the Board on any actions it takes on  matters or persons referred to it by the Board, unless the IG completes an investigation and  submits a petition for a finding of probable cause to the Board based on that investigation.  This is unlike the arrangement in New York City between its Conflicts of Interests Board and  Department of Investigation.  Staff is making preparations to send out the 2017 form to all employees and officials who  will be required to file them by the close of business on May 31, 2017.  We anticipate about  3,600 filers for 2017. This requires sending spreadsheets to each department, aldermanic  office and City Council Committee and to the Office of Legislative Counsel and Government  Affairs with lists of 2016 filers instructing them to update the lists according to the criteria  set by the Board and Ordinance for who must file the form.  As in past years, the Board’s  EFIS system will send out email notices to all filers on or about March 1, 2017.      As of the close of 2016, there were 619 lobbyists registered, and the Board had collected  $346,350 in registration fees. This figure represents about 42% of our operating budget.     The annual registration (or re-registration) deadline for lobbyists is by the close of  business, Friday, January 20.  All lobbyists’ filings must be completed on-line, using the  Board’s ELF system. As of this writing, approximately 175 lobbyists have registered for  2017, and approximately 216 have filed their quarterly reports for the final quarter of 2016,  and the Board has collected $72,250 in registration fees.  All lobbyists who fail to register or  terminate or file activity reports, as required, will be subject to the due process procedures  and penalties for violating the Ordinance, including fines of up to $1,000 per day, and a  public announcement of their violations.   Since the last regularly scheduled Board meeting, the office has received two (2) new  requests under the Freedom of Information Act. One request was a statement about a  Supreme Court case; the requestor was advised this agency had no responsive documents.  The other request was for one filed statement of financial interests from an alderman, and a  request for a list of all penalties for 5 years assessed against the alderman for late filing of  those statements. The requestor was sent a .pdf of the one responsive record the agency  had, and was advised that the Board has no record indicating any penalties imposed for late  filing.

In addition, staff  reported no change in status with respect to Case No. 13039.OLIG.  Case No. 16032.A, Gifts  In this case, the Board VOTED 4-0 (Mary T. Carr, Fran R. Grossman and Nancy  Andrade, absent) to approve the draft appendix to the opinion in this case, holding  that a City employee or official who accepts an offer to purchase tickets to a high- demand event at face value or less, and who performs an official public function  early on in the event, and then wishes to leave the event, is prohibited from giving  his or her ticket (to use for the remainder of the event) to other City employees or  officials or to members of the public. The Appendix will be posted on the Board’s  website as an appendix to the original opinion.     3.

Case No. 16047.C, Money for Advice      The Board heard staff’s report on a citizen complaint received and referred to the  Office of Inspector General for action it deems appropriate.   Member Stephen W. Beard left the meeting at 5:38 p.m.        6.  Case No. 17001.01.TR, et seq., Training    Staff reported that, pursuant to Governmental Ethics Ordinance §§2-156-145 through - 148, and §2-156-465, all City employees and elected officials are required to complete  an online ethics training each year no later than December 31.  Failure to timely  complete this training results in: (i) a finding of an ethics violation; (ii) the public  release of the violator’s name; and (iii) potential fines to the violator ranging from  $200-$750 for each day until the training is completed.  The Board’s Executive Director  imposes the daily fine following a seven (7) day grace period after notifying the subject  of a probable cause violation.    On January 4, 2017, the Board’s staff issued 12 Probable Cause Notices of Ethics  Violations to individuals who had not completed the 2016 training.  Of those cases,  there were eight (8) ethics violations (seven (7) employees and one (1) alderman); one  (1) case withdrawn (the employee terminated City service on 12/30/2016); three (3)  cases waived (one (1) whose status was in progress, and one (1) new employee, and  one (1) new part-time employee with technical issues). No fines were imposed.   Staff also reported that, on January 11, 2017, the Board’s Executive Director received a  letter from the alderman who had not timely completed the training, and the letter  asserted defenses.  However, the Board, having discussed the validity of these  assertions in executive session, VOTED 4-0 (Nancy C. Andrade, Mary T. Carr and   B.

Beard, absent)  to direct staff to notify each of candidates for the Special Election for 4th Ward  alderman (to be held February 28, 2017) who had not yet filed Statements of Financial  Interests that they have until a date certain to file, and that, if they fail to file, the Board  will impose appropriate sanctions, including making public their names and violations  for failure to file.  8.  Case No. 17003.A, Money for Advice  In this case, the Board VOTED 4-0 (Nancy C. Andrade, Mary T. Carr and Stephen W.  Beard, absent) to direct staff to prepare an advisory opinion for the February meeting  advising an alderman and a City council employee that: (i) “City council employees,”  meaning persons paid by contract to perform services for aldermen or their ward  offices, are subject to the Ordinance’s Substantive Code of Conduct (Article II) as  though they are “employees”; (ii) discusses the restrictions the Ordinance places on  City employees or officials who would be the beneficiaries of GoFundMe campaigns;  and (iii) advises aldermen and department heads of best practices with respect to  monitoring their employees’ activities with respect to GoFundMe campaigns.    9.

Case No. 17005.LOB, Lobbying  In this case, the Board, having heard staff’s extensive report on potential unregistered  lobbying by an individual that took place for more than four (4) months, and the  procedural posture of the case, as well as potential penalties that the Board could  impose on the unregistered lobbyist as well as the client who retained that individual,  the Chair directed the staff to prepare revised probable cause notices to be considered  by the Board at a special meeting the following week so the Board could issue them,  and directed that Board members ascertain whether they would need to recuse  themselves due to a potential conflict, under Board Rule 2-5. (Nancy C. Andrade, Mary  T. Carr and Stephen W. Beard were absent from the meeting, and Zaid Abdul-Aleem  recused himself from discussion of this matter.)      At 5:50 p.m., the Board VOTED 4-0 (Nancy C. Andrade, Mary T. Carr and Stephen W. Beard, absent) to  adjourn the meeting.   bd-minutes-2-15-17-os-final

Bagaman ang Ebola outbreak ay isang humanitarian crisis sa West Africa, hindi  naglalagay ng makahulugang panganib sa mga mamamayan ng U.S. ang epidemya. Hindi madaling kumalat ang  Ebola virus. Ipinaliliwanag ng fact sheet na ito ang ilang mga pangunahing kaalaman tungkol sa karamdaman.     Ano ba ang Ebola?  Ang Ebola ay isang hemorrhagic fever virus na pakalat-kalat na lumabas simula sa unang pagkilala dito noong 1976 at  pinangalanan alinsunod sa isang ilog sa Democratic Republic of Congo sa Africa, kung saan ito unang kinilala. Natukoy  din ang virus sa mga kabag o paniki at mga primate. Nagdudulot ang Ebola ng malubhang karamdaman. Nasa pagitan ng  50 at 90% ng mga taong nahawahan ng virus ang namamatay.   Anu-ano ba ang mga sintomas?  Ang mga sintomas ng Ebola ay kinabibilangan ng: lagnat, pananakit ng ulo, pananakit ng kasukasuan at kalamnan,  panghihina, diyariya o pagtatae, pagsusuka, pananakit ng tiyan, kawalan ng ganang kumain at abnormal na pagdurugo.  Maaaring magkaroon ang ilang mga pasyente ng singaw, namumulang mga mata, sinok, ubo, pananakit ng lalamunan,  pananakit ng dibdib, kahirapan sa paghinga o paglunok o pagdurugo sa loob o sa labas ng katawan.   Ang mga sintomas ay pinakangkaraniwan nang nagsisimula 8-10 araw matapos makapitan ng Ebola virus nguni't  maaaring lumitaw nang kasing-aga ng 2 araw at hanggang sa 21 araw pagkatapos ng exposure o pagkalantad.   Paano ba kumakalat ang Ebola ?  Ang Ebola virus ay kumakalat sa pamamagitan ng direktang pagkadikit sa dugo o iba pang mga likido mula sa katawan  (suka, tae, ihi, gatas sa dibdib, pawis, semilya) ng isang taong nahawahan na may mga sintomas o sa isang taong  kamakailan lang namatay dahil sa Ebola. Maaari din itong kumalat sa pamamagitan ng mga bagay (objects) o lugar  (surfaces) na kontaminado ng mga likido mula sa katawan ng isang taong nahawahan ng Ebola virus, halimbawa ay  damit o kumot. Hindi kumakalat ang Ebola sa pamamagitan ng hangin o ng tubig, o pagkain sa pangkalahatan.  Gayunpaman, sa Africa, maaaring kumalat ang Ebola bilang resulta ng paghawak ng bush meat (pangangaso ng mga  ligaw na hayop para kainin) at pagkadikit sa mga nahawahang kabag o paniki. Maaari din itong kumalat sa pamamagitan  ng pagkain ng isang hayop na nahawahan ng Ebola, kabilang mga kabag o paniki.    Ang isang taong nahawahan ng Ebola virus ay HINDI makapagpapasa nito sa ibang tao bago lumitaw ang anumang mga  sintomas.     Sino ba ang nanganganib sa Ebola?  Napakababa ng panganib para sa pangkalahatang publiko na mahawa ng Ebola. Ang mga healthcare provider o mga  miyembro ng pamilya na nangangalaga sa mga pasyenteng nahawahan ng Ebola sa West Africa ang mas higit na  nangaganib dahil nadidikit sila sa dugo o iba pang mga likido mula sa katawan.    Ano bang gamot ang mayroon?  Walang lisensiyadong gamot o bakuna para sa sakit na Ebola virus, bagaman sumasailalim sa pagsisiyasat ang dalawa.  Ang gamot para sa Ebola ay pagsuporta ng mga intravenous fluid, pagme-maintain ng blood pressure at oxygenation at  paggamot sa mga karagdagang impeksiyon kung mayroon.    Paano ko ba mapangangalagaan ang sarili ko?  Iwasan ang mga hindi kinakailangang paglalakbay sa mga apektadong lugar ng outbreak ng sakit na Ebola virus. Kung  nasa isang apektadong lugar ka:   •  Iwasang madikit sa dugo at likido mula sa katawan ng isang taong may karamdaman.  •  Huwag hahawak ng mga bagay na nadikit sa dugo o likido mula sa katawan ng isang taong nahawahan.  •  Gumamit ng protective clothing o pananggalang na kasuotan (mga guwantes, gown o damit na mahaba, maskara   at salamin sa mata) kapag nangangalaga sa mga taong may-sakit.   •  Bantayan ang kalusugan mo sa loob ng 21 araw pagkatapos lisanin ang apektadong lugar. Humanap kaagad ng   medikal na pangangalaga kung nakararanas ka ng mga sintomas ng Ebola.       Para sa higit pang impormasyon: http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola   10/2014

A plan of operation was presented to the Local Liquor Control Commission and it   was not approved.  On December 27, 2010, the applicant was advised by a letter from    Gregory Steadman, in his position as the Local Liquor Control Commissioner, that the   plan of operation submitted did not provide reasonable assurances that the issuance of the   liquor license would not have a deleterious impact on the surrounding community.   This   letter stated the primary concerns expressed by the community were that the issuance of   the license would adversely affect the surrounding neighborhood by an increase in traffic,   litter, noise and illegal consumption of alcohol by people on the public way.  Specifically,    it was noted the plan of operation did not address the community concern that the   issuance of a liquor license will increase commercial traffic from Walgreens that will be   routed westbound on Glenlake.  This would cause an increase of traffic, noise and safety   issues.          Subsequent to the filing of this appeal, the applicant was allowed to file an   amended plan of operation.  While there was no written amended denial letter addressing   this plan, testimony at the hearing established this amended plan of operation did not   satisfy the Local Liquor Control Commissioner that the issuance of this liquor license, at   this location, would not cause a deleterious impact on the surrounding community.           2      Since this is a denial of an application of a Packaged Goods license the issue   before this Commission is to determine de novo the propriety of that decision.  This   Commission must first determine if the City has met its burden that the issuance of the   license would cause a deleterious impact.  If the City does not meet that burden, the   denial would be reversed outright.  If the Commission determines that the City has met its   burden that the issuance of this license would cause a deleterious impact, the Commission   must then address if the decision that the proposed amended plan of operation did not   adequately address the issues causing the deleterious impact on the community.                A synopsis of the evidence will help understand this decision.    Debra Silverstein has been the Alderman of the 50th Ward since May of 2011.    Since then her focus has been working on cleaning up the neighborhood and working   with the police to try to get crime off the street.  She is familiar with the Walgreens   business that has applied for a license to sell packaged liquor goods at that location.  That   area is one of her ward’s hot spots.  There are a couple of buildings that are involved with   the Troubled Buildings Program.  There are gangs and drugs going on in that area, and it   is her belief that having a liquor store around the corner would enhance the negative   activity in that area.  She opposes a liquor license in that particular area because it is a   “hot spot area.”  Her opinion is based on the fact there are gang members and drug   dealing not too far away from the Walgreens.  Having the chance to buy liquor would   increase problems in that area.  There is also problems with garbage and littering in the   area.  There are also concerns from residents with added traffic going down on Glenlake.       3      Alderman Silverstein met with representatives of Walgreens a month before   testifying.  They were unable to satisfactorily address her concerns.          The Alderman stated she has put a moratorium on all packaged goods licenses in   the ward but that does not mean she is opposed to all such licenses.  The moratorium can   be lifted in two block areas with her approval.  She imposed the moratorium to have more   control as to how and under what circumstances liquor licenses are issued in the 50th   Ward.          She could not recall the exact date she met with the representatives of Walgreens.   Donovan Pepper and a Tom Murphy were at the meeting, as was some people from her   office.  The objections expressed were not as to Walgreens as a business entity, but with   this location.  She expressed her overall support for Walgreens and how it conducts   business in her ward.  She believes Walgreens to be a good corporate citizen and she   welcomes them in the 50th Ward.  She does believe that if Walgreens has packaged goods   its operation of business could possibly result in an increase in crime in her ward.  She   has not done any study or investigation to determine if Walgreens is a contributor to   crime in her ward.  She has found Walgreens to operate in compliance with City of   Chicago ordinances.  She feels safety cameras are a positive but those security cameras   do not go a few blocks away.  Her concern is what happens after consumers leave the   store.  She does not have the details about Walgreens’ proposed plan of operation that   would limit and impose certain restrictions on how and under what circumstances liquor   would be sold at this location.  She is not aware of any of Walgreens internal hiring      4   policies with regards to selling to eligible persons.  She reiterated her concerns are the   gang members not too far away and being able to get alcohol just two blocks away.  She   is aware that Walgreens has voluntarily opted not to carry low-end malt liquor, fortified   wines and single serving containers of that nature.            The Alderman repeated her position that this area should not have liquor at all.    She explained that at this moment this is a hot spot area with a lot of crime.  Until that is   cleared up, she does not want any establishment selling liquor.          She has not undertaken any type of traffic study to ascertain if the location of   Walgreens negatively impacted traffic flow.  The concerns about traffic are based on   what she is hearing from residents.  She did acknowledge the configuration of Walgreens   and its parking lot and curb cuts was reviewed and approved by the City, but added that   was without the alcohol.  She did not know what percentage of customers travel to   Walgreens in foot.  She does not know and does not feel it relevant to know the   anticipated overall percentage of sales of alcohol at this location if they were granted a   license.          Michael Lindberg has been a Chicago Police Officers in the 24th District for his   entire sixteen year career.  He is familiar with this Walgreens since his assignment on   foot patrol on Devon Avenue is approximately two blocks away.  He is at this hearing as   the representative of the 24th District.  He was asked to attend by the sergeant of   neighborhood relations.  The former Commander Michael Wick retired the day before      5   Lindberg’s testimony.  Lindberg testified he is worried about people buying 40 ounce   bottles or tall 20 ounce cans and going to the vacant lots across from Walgreens to drink   and litter.  His opinion would be affected to an extent if he found out Walgreens would   not sell 40 ounce bottles or twenty ounce cans.  He is also concerned for the potential for   homeless because you usually find homeless begging by places that sell liquor.          His concern about gang activity in the area deals with older gang members buying   alcohol and distributing it to minors.  He has noticed problems with the sale of drugs or   narcotics all around the area on the east side of Western.  He would give an opinion on   whether the license should or should not be issued but he does have concerns.          Officer Lindberg did not know if Commander Wick has voiced an objection to   this particular license.  He did not know who owned the unfenced vacant lots, but those   are a source of problematic crime and activity.  He does not know if the City of   Chicago’s Building Gang Unit has been directed to the vacant lot.  The officer admitted   he had no knowledge as to the products Walgreens intends to sell at this location and did   not review any of Walgreens’ policies with regard to the sale of alcohol.  He has not   reviewed the security system for this location and has not spoken to anyone who works at   this Walgreens store or any corporate representative of Walgreens.  Lindberg also stated   the Walgreens at this location is not affiliated with gang activity and he believes   Walgreens will call if gang members loiter in the parking lot.          6      Sadie Gerbic has lived at 6046 N. Campbell for sixteen years.  She has been   involved with the 5040 Neighbors Association, which was created due to the   development of the Walgreens property.  She also attends CAPS meetings and has had   block meetings at her home.  Her home is to the west and south of Walgreens.  She was   involved in obtaining petitions in opposition to Walgreens. Her concerns if a packaged   goods license is issued to Walgreens is increased litter and about the traffic flow onto   Glenlake into the residential area.  She hoped people coming from the business would not   go westbound through the neighborhood at increased speeds.  She has not noticed any   substantial increase in traffic on Glenlake since Walgreens opened, but is concerned she   will if liquor is sold at Walgreens.  She sees cars double parked by a liquor store at   Peterson and Maplewood.  There is concern with litter since she has seen a huge increase   in liquor bottles in black bags in her alley.  She feels it is more appropriate for liquor to   be sold in commercial areas, not in residential areas.  She started collecting the petitions   in August of 2009, and she and others obtained about 200 signatures.  She attended an   initial zoning meeting but had mailed the petitions to Walgreens and others.  The issue at   that was whether to permit Walgreens to build a drive-thru because that was a zoning   change.  That zoning change and drive-thru was subsequently approved.  She is   concerned about litter, traffic safety and an acceleration of drinking.          The petitions were circulated with respect to a matter before the Zoning Board of   Appeals and were circulated before the liquor license application was filed.  While the   increase in traffic has been minor, she opposes the license in part because of a concern   that a liquor license might lead to an increase in vehicular traffic proceeding westbound       7   concerns.  People are also drinking and having sex in cars.  The traffic situation at the   new Walgreens is very dangerous because of traffic coming from the new parking lot and   the old parking lot is for the old Walgreens directly across the street.  People are trying to   make the light at Granville and Western and cut each other off.  She does feel the   configuration of the Walgreens parking lot is dangerous.  She does not know about the   formal plan of operation presented by Walgreens but did read it would sell only beer and   wine.  The source of most alcoholic beverage related issues is Peterson’s Liquors at   Maplewood and Peterson.          Anastasia Glapan has lived at 2601 West Farwell for the last twenty years.  That   is about seven blocks north of this Walgreens.  She is concerned about the issuance of a   license at this location due to the gang bangers in the area.  The older gang members buy   alcohol for the youngsters.  It is a safety concern.  Additional trash and littering are also   concerns.  She admitted she is not aware of Walgreens’ policies of the sale of alcohol or   security policies at this location, or how employees are trained to ensure proper   identification is shown before alcohol is sold.  She agreed she is opposed to any   additional licenses being issued at or near her home at this time.  The problem is that   Walgreens does not take responsibility once the liquor is sold and it is off their premises.    It then becomes the community’s problem.  She is not aware of any proposed plan of   operation.           Debra Sidock has lived in the neighborhood for twenty years and is temporarily   living at 2639 West Ainslie.  She is planning to return to this neighborhood.  She opposes      10
