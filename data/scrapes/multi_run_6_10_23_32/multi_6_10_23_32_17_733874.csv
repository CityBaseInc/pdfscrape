In September, Department of Water Management crews will begin work to install a new  sewer main in N. Parkside Avenue (Diversey-George) and in W. George Street (Linder- Luna). The old sewer dates back to 1927 and needs to be replaced.     During construction, our project will require a full continuous closure of Diversey at  Parkside for about one week. Detour routes will be posted in advance. Otherwise, when we  are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always  be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    31st Ward Office: 773-278-0031    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                                                                                114TH STREET WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 551 feet of 8-inch water  main in E. 114th Street, from S. Cottage Grove Avenue to the Alley East of S. Langley Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by mid July 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on E. 114th Street outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                  CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN ANTHONY BEALE    773-785-1100                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid July 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

Starting in early April, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will  install 1,400 feet of 24-inch, 30-inch, and 36-inch new sewer main in S. Langley Avenue  (40th Street-Oakwood Boulevard), and in E. Oakwood Boulevard (Langley Avenue- Vincennes Avenue). The old sewer dates back to 1889 and needs to be replaced.     For a period of time, eastbound traffic on Oakwood Boulevard will be closed at S. Vincennes  Avenue. Vehicular traffic will be detoured from Vincennes north to Pershing, east to  Cottage Grove, and back to Oakwood Boulevard. Our contractor will provide and maintain  access for local and emergency vehicles during the construction period. Otherwise, when   working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business. Outside of working hours, a travel lane will  be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    3rd Ward Office: 773-373-9273    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,637 feet of 8-inch water main in W. 73rd Street, from S.  Kedzie Avenue to S. California Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1909, and needs to be  replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Lane’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Lona Lane               18th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                  Do you wonder what was happening in 1909?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:               ERROL FLYNN        The first U.S. university school of nursing was established, at the University of   Minnesota.     Joan of Arc was declared a saint.    The first Lincoln head pennies were minted.    The Indianapolis 500 race track opened.    Actor Errol Flynn was born.    Workers began pouring concrete for the Panama Canal.    The first subway car with side doors went into service in New York City.                           WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,637 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. 73rd Street, from S. Kedzie Avenue to S. California Avenue.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in July. Final restoration will follow in August. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN LONA LANE   773-471-1991      PETE SCALES – DEPARTMENT OF WATER MANAGEMENT        312-744-8822                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in July. Final  restoration will follow in August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at  the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

You may wish to contact a lawyer  or your local legal aid or housing counseling agency to discuss any right that you  may have.     Pursuant to the City of Chicago's Protecting Tenants in Foreclosed Rental Property  Ordinance, if you are a qualified tenant you may be eligible for relocation  assistance in the amount of $10,600 unless the owner offers you the option to  renew or extend your current written or oral rental agreement with an annual rent  that: (1) for the first 12 months, does not exceed 102 percent of your current annual  rent; and (2) for any 12-month period thereafter, does not exceed 102 percent of  the immediate prior 12-month period's annual rent. The option to renew or extend  your lease shall continue until the property is sold to a bona fide third-party  purchaser.     If you are eligible as a qualified tenant and the owner fails to pay you the  relocation assistance that is due, you may bring a private cause of action in a court  of competent jurisdiction seeking compliance with the Protecting Tenants in  Foreclosure Rental Property Ordinance, Chapter 5-14 of the Municipal Code of  Chicago, and the prevailing plaintiff shall be entitled to recover, in addition to any  other remedy available, his damages and reasonable attorney's fees.”      Tłumaczenie polskie      Poniższe powiadomienie nie jest nakazem opuszczenia lokalu.

One Stop Mart, Inc.     Shantanna M. Griffith, President   Applicant (Packaged Goods)    for the premises located at     6360 South Kedzie Avenue      v.               Department of Business Affairs & Licensing   Local Liquor Control Commission       Scott V. Bruner, Director                     This matter comes before the License Appeal Commission for a hearing de novo on the   ORDER    denial of the Appellant=s request for a packaged goods license.  It was denied because the store is   located in a moratorium district and because the issuance of this license would cause a   deleterious impact on the community.       With regard to the moratorium issue it was stipulated by the parties that the premises   were and are located in a moratorium area.  The moratorium bars any additional packaged goods   licenses.  In most cases that stipulation would be determinative of the case.  In this case which   the applicant stipulated to the moratorium she went forth with evidence on the argument that the   legal theory of equitable estoppel should bar the Local Liquor Control Commission from   denying the issuance of the license because of the moratorium.    Equitable estoppel is based on the principle that one may not act in a certain matter and                       1   then take an inconsistent position which prejudices another who acted in reliance on the act.  It   arises when one party, by his or her words or conduct, intentionally and through culpable   negligence, reasonably induces another to rely on his or her representations, and as a result of   that reliance, the other changes his or her position to his or her injury.       The use of equitable estoppel against a municipality is not favored and will be allowed   only in extraordinary or compelling circumstances.  Village of Wadsworth v. Kerton 311 Ill. 3d   829, 726 N.E. 2d 150.  To involve equitable estoppel against a municipality there must be an   affirmative act on the part of the municipality such as a legislative enactment rather than the   authorized acts of misinterpretation or ministerial misinterpretation.  A municipality cannot be   estopped by an act of its agent beyond the authority expressly conferred on that official Hamwi   v. Zollar 299 Ill. App. 3d 1008, 702 N.E. 2d 593.  Representations of an attorney are insufficient   to bind a municipality under equitable estoppel. 264 Ill. App. 3d 887, 637 N.E. 2d 110.       The issue to be addressed first is whether the actions of then Alderman Thomas or the   actions of the employees of the Department of Business Affairs & Licensing were such that they   would estop the City of Chicago from denying the license.  The answer is no as to both.    Shantanna M. Griffith, the owner of the corporate applicant, testified she was aware that a   moratorium was in effect prior to starting the application process.  When she started the process   in October 2006, that an agent of the Department of Business Affairs & Licensing told her to get   the support of the alderman.  Theodore Thomas was the Alderman and he originally opposed the   application.  After he met with community groups he withdrew his opposition and on march 19,                       2   2007, he wrote a letter to Scott Bruner, Director of the Department of Business Affairs and   Licensing, memorializing his support and withdrawing his objection to SLW One Stop mart,   Inc., obtaining a liquor license.  What Alderman Thomas did not do was to take any of the steps   needed to lift the moratorium.  Alderman Thomas was defeated in his bid for re-election in April   2007, and Alderman Foulkes testified she is opposed to lifting the moratorium on liquor stores   applicable to this address.  The actions of former Alderman Thomas were insufficient to impose   equitable estoppel against the City.  There were specific procedures that needed to be followed   for the moratorium to be lifted and they were not done.       The actions of the employees of the Department of Business Affairs and Licensing did   not provide a sufficient base on which to impose equitable estoppel.  While Ms. Griffith suggests   that the Department of Business Affairs and Licensing should not have taken the $4,400 in   application fees and should not have processed the application which led to building inspections   that required spending thousands of dollars to bring the building into code, it does not change the   fact that such actions are not sufficient to impose equitable estoppel.  Ms. Griffith knew at all   times that a moratorium was in effect.  While the evidence is conflicting on this point, Ms.   Griffith may also have been advised specifically by Business Affairs and Licensing that the letter   from Alderman Thomas was not sufficient and the moratorium must be lifted prior to the   issuance of the license.  There is evidence that it was Ms. Griffith who made a knowing decision   to file the application with the moratorium still in effect.             While this Commission understands Ms. Griffith=s feelings that the process may have                  3   been unfair to her the evidence presented at this hearing is not sufficient for the principle of   equitable estoppel to be imposed and an order be entered granting the packaged goods license.        Since the moratorium is in effect and according to Alderman Foulkes will remain in   effect it is not necessary to address the issue of whether the City proved by a preponderance of   the evidence that the granting of the packaged goods license would cause a deleterious impact on   the community.    THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED That the said order or action of the Local   Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago be and the same hereby is AFFIRMED.    Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a petition for rehearing may be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order is deemed  to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the Circuit Court, the  petition for rehearing must be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order as  such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.
