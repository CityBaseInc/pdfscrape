Description of Tax      Effective  January  1,  1992,  the  Chicago  Telecommunications  Tax  (Chicago  Municipal  Code  (“M.C.C.”)  chapter  3-70)  (hereafter  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  “Telecommunications  Tax”)    was  imposed  on  the  act  or  privilege  of  originating  or  receiving  telecommunications  in  the  city  of  Chicago  at  a  rate  of  5%  of  gross  charges.   Effective January 1, 1998, the Chicago Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance  Fee (M.C.C. chapter 3-75) (hereafter sometimes referred to as the “IMF”) was imposed  on  the  act  or  privilege  of  originating  or  receiving  telecommunications  in  the  city  of  Chicago  at  a  rate  of  2%  of  gross  charges.    Effective  January  1,  2003,  the  Chicago  Simplified Telecommunications Tax (M.C.C. chapter 3-73) (hereafter sometimes referred  to as “the Simplified Tax” or  “tax”) replaced the Telecommunications Tax and  the IMF.   The  rate  of  the  Simplified  Tax  is  7%  of  gross  charges.    In  general,  the  terms  of  the  Simplified Tax are essentially the same as those of the Telecommunications Tax.     The  tax  is  imposed  on  the  act  or  privilege  of  originating  or  receiving  telecommunications  in  the  city  of  Chicago.    The  tax  applies  to  both  intrastate  telecommunications (telecommunications that originate and terminate within the state of  Illinois)  and  interstate  telecommunications  (telecommunications  that  either  originate  or  terminate outside Illinois).  The tax rate is 7% of the gross charge for telecommunications  purchased at retail from a retailer.  (Municipal Code of Chicago, hereinafter “M.C.C.,” 3- 73-030.)  Every telecommunications retailer maintaining a place of business in Illinois,  which is subject to the jurisdiction of the city, must collect the tax from its customers  who originate or receive telecommunications in Chicago. (M.C.C., 3-73-040.)   Retailers  must register with the department of revenue (M.C.C., 3-73-060) and (in general, subject  to the provisions of M.C.C., 3-4-186, 3-4-187, 3-4-188 and 3-4-189) remit the tax to the  department on a monthly basis.  (M.C.C., 3-73-050.)  Retailers who remit the tax in a  timely manner may retain 1.0% of the tax collected to reimburse them for collection and  remittance expenses.  (M.C.C., 3-73-40(D).)        2.  Prepaid Telephone Calling Arrangements    Prepaid telephone calling arrangements are not considered telecommunications     subject to the Simplified Telecommunications Tax.  They are instead subject to state and  local sales taxes.  ""Prepaid telephone calling arrangements"" means the right to  exclusively purchase telephone or telecommunications services that must be paid for in  advance and enable the origination of one or more intrastate, interstate, or international  telephone calls or other telecommunications using an access number, an authorization   code, or both, whether manually or electronically dialed, for which payment to a retailer  must be made in advance, provided that, unless recharged, no further service is provided  once that prepaid amount of service has been consumed.  Prepaid telephone calling  arrangements include the recharge of a prepaid calling arrangement.  For purposes of this  Section, ""recharge"" means the purchase of additional prepaid telephone or  telecommunications services whether or not the purchaser acquires a different access  number or authorization code.  ""Prepaid telephone calling arrangement"" does not include  an arrangement whereby a customer purchases a payment card and pursuant to which the  service provider reflects the amount of the purchase as a credit on an account for a  customer under an existing subscription plan.          Meaning of “Gross Charge”   3.      The  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  is  imposed  upon  the  gross  charge for telecommunications.  (M.C.C., 3-73-030(A).)  The term “gross charge” means  the amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in  the city of Chicago and for all services provided in connection therewith by a retailer,  valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services  and property of every kind or nature. No deduction may be taken on account of the cost  of the telecommunications, the cost of materials used, labor or service cost or any other  expense whatsoever.  (M.C. C., 3-73-020(F).)  If a retailer provides services that are not  necessary  for,  or  directly  related  to,  the  retailer’s  provision  of  telecommunications  to  customers, and the charges for these services are disaggregated and separately identified  from  other  charges,  then  the  retailer  need  not  include  the  charges  in  gross  charges.   Examples of these services may include directory advertising, specialized designing or  engineering  services,  specialized  security  measures  and  consulting  services.    ""Gross  charges""  for  private  line  service  include  charges  imposed  at  each  channel  point  within  Illinois, charges for the channel mileage between each channel point within Illinois, and  charges for that portion of the interstate inter-office channel provided within Illinois.                4.   Customer Equipment Charges   Gross  charges  do  not  include  charges  for  customer  equipment  including  equipment  that  is  leased  or  rented  by  the  customer  from  any  source,  but  only  if  the  charges are disaggregated and separately identified from other charges. (M.C.C., 3-73- 020(F)(4).)    For  purposes  of  this  provision,  customer  equipment  includes,  but  is  not  limited to, all items generally classified as customer equipment or terminal equipment,  such  as  telephone  instruments  and  station  sets,  dialers,  modems,  private  branch  exchanges (PBX’s), inside wiring, facsimile machines and pagers.  Although charges for  customer equipment may not be subject to the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications  Tax, the lease or rental of customer equipment may be subject to the Chicago Personal  Property Lease Transaction Tax.  (M.C.C., chapter 3-32.)     5.  Computer-Related Charges     Charges for automated data storage, retrieval and processing services or for the  use of computer time or other equipment are not included in gross charges.  (M.C.C., 3- 73-020(F)(3).)  Automated information retrieval or data processing charges also are not  included in gross charges.  For example, customers who access on-line computer data  bases are subject to the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax on the charge for  the transmission of the data, but not on the charge for the data processing or inquiry.  If a  telecommunications retailer provides both transmission and data processing services,  however, the charge for the data processing services will be subject to the tax unless it is  disaggregated and separately identified on billing statements and in the books and records  of the retailer.  In addition, customers who access on-line computer data bases may be  subject to the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax.  (M.C.C., chapter 3-32;  Meites v. City of Chicago, 184 Ill.App.3d 887, 540 N.E.2d 973 (1st Dist. 1989).)     6.   Value-Added Services           Value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act   Generally, persons that provide customers access to the Internet (""Internet Service   on the form, content, code and protocol of information for purposes other than  transmission are not subject to the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax.   (M.C.C., 3-7 3-020(Q)(2).)  For example, charges for computer data, and protocol  conversions (permitting computers to exchange data, regardless of the language or  protocol a computer’s out-put may be in) are not subject to the tax.  To avoid taxation,  however, charges for these services must be disaggregated and separately stated.   Furthermore, charges for services that are provided for the purposes of transmission are  subject to the tax, even if the form, content, code or protocol of the information is acted  upon in the course of providing the services.  Thus, for example, charges for the service  commonly referred to as “Voice Over Internet Protocol” (or “VOIP”) are subject to the  tax.      Providers"" or ""ISPs"") and who do not, as part of that service, charge customers for the  line or other transmission charges that are used to obtain access to the ISP's server or  other point of access, are not considered to be telecommunications retailers from these  activities.  This is the case so long as such ISPs do not, as part of their billing, charge  customers for such line charges and instead pay their telecommunications suppliers all  transmission costs that they incur in providing the Internet service.  In this situation, an  ISP's customer pays his telecommunications supplier for all transmission costs incurred  while using the service.  The single monthly fee charged by the ISP, which often  represents a flat charge for a package of items including Internet access, e-mail, and  electronic newsletters, would generally not be subject to tax.  If, however, the ISP  charges customers for line or other transmission charges, then it should provide its  telecommunications suppliers with Certificates of Resale and should collect and remit the  tax.  For example, if an ISP provides customers with Internet access, as described in this  section, but also provides customers the use of a 1-800 service to access the ISP, and  separately assesses customers per minute charges for the use of the 1-800 service, then  the ISP is considered a telecommunications retailer and incurs telecommunications tax on   the charges made for the 1-800 service.  If the charges are not disaggregated as provided  in subsection (c), then all charges are subject to the telecommunications tax.     7.  Advertising Revenue   Gross  charges  do  not  include  advertising  revenue  either  from  directory  sales  (such as “yellow pages”) or from message additions to telecommunications. For example,  revenues from an advertising message preceding a time/weather call are not included in  gross charges.     8.  Certain Services Included in Gross Charges   Gross charges include, but are not limited to, charges for unlisted or unpublished  numbers, operator assistance, directory information, call-waiting, call-forwarding, burglar  alarm services and answering services provided by telecommunications retailers.     9.   “900” Numbers                                       The Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax applies to telephone calls made  to 900 numbers if the caller is located in Chicago and receives a billing at the caller’s  service address.  The telecommunications retailer, however, is required to collect the tax  only  upon  the  line  charge.    The  invoice  to  the  caller  for  a  900  number  call  need  not  separately  state  the  line  charge  and  tax.    For  example,  a  call  to  a  900  code  number  is  made to register an opinion in a poll. The caller is billed $1.00. The $0.80 transmission  charge  is  retained  by  the  telecommunications  retailer,  and  $0.20  is  given  to  the  poll  tabulator.  $0.80 is included in gross charges.     10.  Information and Entertainment Services   Gross charges include the transmission charges for information or entertainment  services  such  as  time/weather,  gab  line/party  line  and  other  public  announcement  services.  However, charges for the message content or information of these services are  not included in gross charges.     11 .  Persons Selling to Retailer’s Customers   a.   If a telecommunications retailer receives billing and collection fees  from  persons  selling  services  or  products  to  the  retailer’s  customers,  and  these  fees are billed and collected by the telecommunications retailer, the fees are not  included in gross charges.  For example, a call to a 900 code number is billed by  the telecommunications retailer as follows:    $25.00 - purchase price charged to   caller for product or service    $ 0.35 - call charge ($0.20 call, $0.15   billing and collection fee).   Only the $0.20 charged for the telephone call is included in gross charges and subject to  the tax.     b.   The  following  fees  also  are  not  included  in  gross  charges:    (i)  billing and collection fees paid by persons selling services or products directly to  a telecommunications retailer’s customers; and (ii) billing and collection fees paid  by  a  telecommunications  retailer  to  a  credit  card  company  whose  holders  have  charged calls.   12.  Other Taxes                               Gross  charges  do  not  include  the  taxes  imposed  by  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  Ordinance,  the  Illinois  Telecommunications  Excise  Tax  Act,  section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the charges imposed on consumers for 911  service.  (M.C.C., 3-73-020(F) (1).)         13.  Exemption for State Governments and Universities   The  exemption  for  state  governments  and  state  universities  created  by  statute  extends  only  to  telecommunications  they  purchase  for  their  own  use.  (M.C.C.,  3-73  - 020(N)(1).)  They are not exempt from the obligation to collect and remit tax on sales of  telecommunications  to  others  when  they  act  as  retailers  of  telecommunications.    For  example, a state university is exempt from the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications  Tax  on  purchases,  by  the  university,  of  telecommunications  for  use  by  its  faculty  and  staff in the course of their duties.  However, the university is required to collect and remit  tax on sales of telecommunications to students in university dormitories.     14.  Retailers and Resellers of Telecommunications   a.   Retailers  of  telecommunications  are  persons  who  engage  in  the  business of making sales of telecommunications at retail.  (M.C.C., 3-73-020(L),  (N).)  Telecommunications retailers include, but are not limited to, persons that  operate  or  provide  radio  repeater  services,  paging  services,  radio  dispatch  services, facsimile transmission services and party line services.   b.   of   are   Resellers   telecommunications   considered  telecommunications retailers and, therefore, are required to collect and remit the  Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax based upon the gross charges they  receive  for  telecommunications.    In  the  event  that  a  retailer  who  resells  telecommunications has paid the tax to a local exchange carrier or other retailer,  the reseller may make an application (including supporting documentation) to the  department for a credit memorandum.  Telecommunications resellers include, but  are not limited to, universities and hotels.    15.  Mobile Operations Reporting Option   a.     Retailers  of  telecommunications  who  provide  cellular  phone,  mobile radio, paging or other services, where the customer’s service address is in  fact not a fixed site but rather a motor vehicle or other mobile location, shall use  the customer’s place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications  Sourcing Conformity Act, Public Law 106-252, as amended from time to time,  which as of January 1, 2003 provides that the “place of primary use” means the  street  address  representative  of  where  the  customer’s  use  of  the  mobile  telecommunications service primarily occurs, and which further provides that this  means the residential street address or the primary business street address of the  customer within the licensed service area of the home service provider.  For air- to-ground  systems  and  the  like,  ""service  address""  shall  mean  the  location  of  a  taxpayer's  primary  use  of  the  telecommunications  equipment  as  defined  by  telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.  (M.C.C., 3-73--020(O).)     Retailers    should  not    apportion  gross  charges  based  upon  the  physical  location  of  a  mobile  portable  telecommunications  device  at  the  time  service  is  provided.  For  example,  a  retailer  providing  service  to  a    place  of  primary use in Chicago must collect Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax  on all telecommunications billed to  the customer.    16.  Interstate and International Telecommunications   b.   a.   Obligation of agents.  If a local exchange carrier acting as an agent   of a long distance carrier, inter-exchange carrier, alternative operator service or  billing and collections contractor (a) bills local customers for long distance  service, local service and the taxes applicable for those services and (b) remits a  portion of the collections to its principal, then the local exchange carrier or retailer  must remit tax to the department of revenue only for the amounts it retains. The  local exchange carrier or retailer is required to maintain billing and accounting  data and to provide the data to the department of revenue upon request.   b.   Obligation  of  principals.    Principals  are  responsible  for  remitting  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  on  all  amounts  paid  over  to  them  by  their  agents.    Long  distance  carriers,  inter-exchange  carriers  and  other  retailers who retain local exchange carriers or other agents in Illinois to bill and  collect  gross  charges  from  Chicago  customers  are  considered  to  be  retailers   Interstate telecommunications means all telecommunications that either originate  or  terminate  outside  Illinois.  This  term  includes  telecommunications  that  originate  or  terminate  outside  the  United  States  of  America.  Consumers  paying  a  foreign  tax  on  telecommunications  may  file  a  claim  for  credit  with  the  department  of  revenue  in  the  same manner as with taxes paid to other municipalities. (M.C.C., 3-73-020(G); M.C.C.,  3-73-030(B).)     17.  Responsibility for Accounting and Payment of Tax                       maintaining a place of business in this state.  Thus, they are required to register  with the department and file returns.   c.   Collection fee.  The 1.0% commission authorized by M.C.C., 3-73-   040(D) may be claimed only by the retailer filing a return with the department of  revenue, not by the billing agent, unless the agent also files a remittance return on  behalf of the retailer and remits the applicable tax.    18.  Bad Debts   Gross  charges  do  not  include  bad  debts.    However,  if  any  portion  of  a  debt  deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the telecommunications retailer must report and  pay the tax on that portion of the debt paid during the reporting period. (M.C.C., 3-73- 020(F)(7).)  For purposes of this provision, the term “bad debt” means any portion of a  debt that is related to a sale at retail, for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible  or  excludable,  that  has  become  worthless  or  uncollectible  as  determined  by  relevant  federal income tax standards. (M.C.C., 3-73-020(F).)                19.  Credits        A consumer who has paid both the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax  and a similar tax imposed by another municipality on the same transmission may file a  claim  for  credit  with  the  department  of  revenue.    The  claim  must  be  accompanied  by  documentation  showing  the  taxes  charged  to the  taxpayer  and  relating  the  taxes  to  the  specific call or transaction.  A credit may be available in Chicago to the extent of the tax  imposed  by  the  other  municipality,  if  actually  paid,  but  not  exceeding  the  Chicago  Simplified Telecommunications Tax paid. (M.C.C., 3-73-030(B).)     20.  Application of State Rulings and Regulations    Published   regulations   and   rulings   promulgated     Illinois  Telecommunications  Excise  Tax  Act  (35  ILCS  630/1  et  seq.)  apply  to  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  unless  (1)  a  state  ruling  or  regulation  relates  to  a  provision  of  the  Illinois  Telecommunications  Excise  Tax  Act  that  differs  in  substance  from  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  Ordinance  or  (2)  the  city’s  department  of  revenue  has  promulgated  a  ruling  or  regulation  relating  to  the  same  subject.     under   the   21.

By early July 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,193 feet of new 8-inch water main in W. 22nd Place,  from 395 feet west of S. Wood Street to S. Wood Street, W. 23rd Street, from S. Wolcott Avenue to      S. Wood Street and S. Wood Street, from W. 23rd Street to 80 feet south of S. Blue Island Avenue. The  old water main dates back to 1873, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  25th Ward Office: 773-523-4100  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

Our private contractor is currently installing a new tumbling basin at Wabash and 53rd Street and  a connection structure at State and 53rd Street. Following, our own crews will install a new sewer  in E. 53rd Street, from S. State Street to S. MLK Drive. The old sewer dates back to 1900 and  needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Dowell’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,     Thomas Powers  Commissioner     Cc: Alderman Pat Dowell         3rd Ward                                              1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1       Do you wonder what was happening in 1900?  That’s about the time the old sewer main was  installed beneath your street.  Among other things:           HAMBURGER        Hawaii became a U.S. territory.    The hamburger was created by Louis Lassing in Connecticut.    Actor Spencer Tracy was born.    The U.S. Navy’s first submarine made its debut.    The second modern Olympic Games opened in Paris, and lasted for 5 months.    L. Frank Baum wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.    The first electric bus became operational in New York City.    English handwriting experts established the art of calligraphy.                                       PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management’s private contractor is currently installing a  new tumbling basin at Wabash and 53rd Street and a connection structure at State and 53rd Street.  Following, in-house crews will install a new sewer in E. 53rd Street, from S. State Street to S.  MLK Drive.    Reason:  The old sewer main dates back to 1900 and needs replacement. The area bounded by  52nd Street on the north, 54th Street on the south, MLK Drive on the east, and State Street on the  west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  The contractor’s work is in progress, and we expect the job to be completed in late  October. Installation of the new sewer will take place from late October to mid-January. Final  restoration of the damaged streets/parkways will follow in May 2014. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:   We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours. When we are working in  the street, we may have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to  reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place. Outside of working  hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Dowell, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!      
11291`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dcd/general/housing/ARO_FAQs.pdf`Success`Success`3`3`Not a fillable PDF.`2015 ARO Frequently Asked Questions effective October 13, 2015   current as of August 7, 2015        Q. If a project includes a City lot – will the ARO apply to the entire project, even if the entire project is not  built on City land?   A. Yes – the Ordinance is specific that “whenever the city sells real property to any developer and such  property or any portion thereof is developed”… with a Residential Housing Project containing ten or more  units, the ARO applies. This is true even when the lot is utilized to satisfy minimum off-street parking,  minimum lot area, setback or other zoning or Municipal Code requirements or standards.      Q. Does the ARO apply to elective Planned Developments?   A: Yes, the ARO would apply, if the PD was located in a downtown zoning district, or the underlying zoning was  increased or changed to trigger the ARO (or City land or financial assistance was provided as part of the PD),  and the developer built a residential housing project on the site.    Q. Does the ARO apply to student housing?   A: The ARO exempts dormitories that are owned and operated by or on behalf of an educational institution.     Q. Does the ARO apply to hotel conversions?   A. If a developer wants to amend a PD to switch units from hotel keys to room keys, the change may reclassify  the building as residential, triggering the ARO if more than ten residential units are added.     Q. Does the ARO apply to hotel/condo units?  A. Hotel/Condo units are under exclusive ownership and therefore are considered dwelling units, triggering  the ARO.     Q. Will Special uses trigger the ARO?  A. Special uses are not technically considered a zoning change and thus will not trigger the ARO.    Q. Is the ARO triggered if a developer is adding units to an existing building?   A: Typically, the ARO only applies to the units that are being added to the existing building. In order not to be  subject to the ARO, existing units must be residential units. Note that if units are converted to condos or meet  the definition of “substantial rehab, they may trigger the ARO requirement, even if they were existing.     If a project receives financial assistance or City land, the existing units and any new units are subject,  collectively, to the ARO.         Page 1 of 3   2015 ARO Frequently Asked Questions effective October 13, 2015   current as of August 7, 2015        Q. What if a developer increases the floor area or unit count to a subarea within a Planned Development  but doesn’t increase the overall FAR or unit count: will the ARO be triggered?  A. The ARO will not apply unless the overall Floor Area is increased, and at least 10 additional residential  units  are developed (constructed; substantially rehabbed or converted from rental to condos) as part of the  amendment. If those triggers are met, the ARO will apply only to any additional units.    Q. Are there any exemptions to the ARO?   A. The ARO does not apply to any Residential Housing Project located on property that was rezoned and  thereby converted to a nonconforming use.  If the City Council subsequently approves a change in zoning  solely for the purpose of restoring the Residential Housing Project to a conforming use, that zoning change will  not trigger the ARO.      Q: Is “Class L” considered financial assistance?   A: Class L is a property tax exemption granted through the County, and is not considered City financial  assistance.    Q. Is the granting of City land considered financial assistance?   A: No.    Q. Does the ARO apply to projects that are receiving tax credits or other financial assistance from the City or  State?   A: Tax Credits constitute financial assistance, and, thus, the ARO applies. However, because the affordability  requirements for tax credits often exceed those of the ARO, the requirements associated with the tax credits  or other financial assistance will govern unless they expire or are withdrawn prior to the 30-year term  required for ARO projects. For PDs receiving Tax credits, Developers are required to include a statement that  requires that, should tax credits become inactive, the 30-year ARO term will apply for the remainder of the 30- year term.     Q. What if the market price and the affordable price are the same – or similar?   A. There is no provision in the ARO that exempts units that are already “affordable” by market standards.     Q. For Rental ARO projects, does it matter which unit in a building is affordable? As long as they continue to  provide affordable units in the required type (i.e. one-bedroom), can they switch from year to year?   A. The units designated as the ARO units must be similar in size and finishes, and must have the same number  of bedrooms as those initially designated as ARO units – but they do not need to be the same units.     Q. Is Parking required to be provided in the price/monthly rent of affordable units?   A. Parking is required to be provided in the price of affordable units if it is provided in the price/rent of the  market units.         Page 2 of 3   2015 ARO Frequently Asked Questions effective October 13, 2015   current as of August 7, 2015        Q. Can I pay my fee-in-lieu with a credit card or through wire transfer?  A. No, the only payment that is accepted is a check, made out to the City of Chicago and hand-delivered to the  ARO PM. It is advised that you make an appointment prior to delivering the payment, in order to ensure that  the ARO PM or their designee is available to receive the check.    Q. I am interested in purchasing a unit created prior to the 2015 ARO, but I earn 110% of the Area Median  Income. Can I purchase the unit?  A. In most cases, no: the terms that were in place at the time of the creation of the unit will, at minimum,  govern the initial sale of the unit, even if it is sold after the effective date of the 2015 ARO.

Any Establishment that is APS-certified under these rules and regulations   must apply for certification of any new or additional location operated by the  Establishment.   6   b.  All unit pricing must be in  United States dollars and cents.  Where the Unit   Price is less than $1.00 per unit priced, the Unit Price shall be shown in at  least cents to the tenth of a cent (for example, show 28.7 cents per ounce, or  0.287 dollars per ounce).   c.  Unit pricing is not required if an Establishment only carries one brand in only   one size.   d.  Variety Combination Packaging and Specialty Establishments shall be exempt   from Unit Price requirements.   e.  Undiluted, concentrated products and un-reconstituted powdered drink mixes   shall be unit priced uniformly with other similar undiluted, concentrated  products and un-reconstituted powdered drink mixes.  Thus, all powdered ice  tea mix packages would be unit priced using the same unit of measure as other  powdered ice tea mix packages, but not necessarily using the same unit as  ready-to-drink ice tea sold in a bottle.  The foregoing is only an example to  illustrate the concept behind the rule, which is that items that compete with  each other must be unit priced uniformly.   RULE 6   Inspection.   Upon receipt of an application, the Commissioner shall cause an   inspection of each APS location for which certification is sought. Inspection will  take place within 90 days after receiving the application letter and payment, or  within 120 days if certification for more than one Establishment is sought.   RULE7   Failure of Inspection.   a.  If the Establishment fails to pass its APS inspection. the Establishment shall   be re-inspected upon payment of are-inspection fee as set forth  in Rule 9.   b.  Re-inspections may require further documentation submitted for inspection   andre-inspection may be limited to such documentation, depending upon each  Establishment's individual situation.   RULES   Renewal of Certification.   Each APS certification must be renewed every four (4) years.  Prior to the  expiration of the current APS certificate, the Department will send a renewal  application.  This application for each business location must be completed and  returned to the Department within the time period specified by the Department.  Nothing in these Rules and Regulations, however, shall relieve an Establishment  from the responsibility of maintaining and renewing its APS Certification.   8   RULE9   APS Certification Application Inspection Fees.   The inspection fee authorized by the City Council shall be remitted to the  Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection within 30 days of  notification of the amount of fees due.  Pursuant to§ 4-276510(b), for Large  Stores, a fee of $500.00 is required for certification of the first store location and  $100.00 for each additional location; for Small Stores, a fee of$250.00 is required  for the first store location and $50.00 for each additional location.  A fee of  $100.00 (Large Stores) and $50.00 (Small Stores) is required for every re(cid:173) inspection necessary due to the failure or late re-scheduling of an applicant's  initial APS certification inspection under these Rules and Regulations.  Not  receiving a renewal application shall not be a defense to a charge of failing to  renew.   SECTION II.   APS  - PRICING   RULE 10   Effect of APS Certification and APS Application.   An Establishment will be exempt from individually price marking each item  offered for purchase only if the Establishment ( 1) has an APS letter of  certification or (2) has a valid, paid application on file and otherwise complies  with Rule 2.   RULE 11   Double Check Procedures.   All  APS  Establishments must designate  an employee at each Establishment's  location, who can verify (a) the on-site accuracy of the information entered into an  automated APS pricing system; (b) the proper placement of shelf labels; and (c)  the proper placement of all other Establishment signage.   RULE 12   Point-Of-Sale Device Requirements.   All APS must provide visible indication, which can be observed from a  ""reasonable"" customer position, of an  item's Price and description (including, if  applicable, the item's weight and measure) as the item is scanned.   RULE 13   Receipt Requirements.   a.  Except as otherwise provided in these rules, every purchase must be   documented by a receipt.  A copy of the receipt must be offered to the  customer.   9   c.  Department Stores need only affix or place a label on a shelf if the items  displayed for sale on the shelf are not already individually price-marked.  Merchandise offered for sale at a counter that is manned with a sales associate  available for immediate assistance is exempt from this rule.   RULE16   Non-Shelved, End Cap, or Other Display Item Signage.   a.  A sign no smaller than 511  x 711  is required for item displays not located on   shelves.  When any question arises as to whether an item is displayed upon a  shelf or not, this non-shelved item rule shall be applied.   b.  The same information as required for Shelf Labels must be included on such   signs.  In addition, the name of the item and its selling price must be no  smaller than  1 II  high bold type.  The following information must be in letters  or numerals no smaller than  ~ 11  high bold type: the regular price (if a sale  item), the item's brand name, if any, and the item' s size OR weight OR  measure OR count.   c.  Department Stores may have signs for non-shelved items on which the selling  price is smaller than 1"" high bold type, but in no case shall such signs display  a price that is smaller than Y..  "" high bold type.  Department Stores need only  affix or place a label on a non-shelved display if the items displayed for sale  are not already individually price-marked.  Merchandise offered for sale at a  counter that is manned with a sales associate available for immediate  assistance is exempt from this rule.   d.  A non-shelved, end cap, or other type of display sign does not require the  Unit Price IF the item displayed is displayed elsewhere in the store with a  shelf label that includes the Unit Price.   RULE 17   Infant Formula.   Establishments which sell reconstituted infant formula, may disclose on the shelf  label or signage the Unit Price per ounce of the formula after water has been  added and the formula is ready for consumption, as well as the total amount of  ounces that the formula makes after reconstitution.   RULE 18   Items which must Be Individually Price-marked.   Any pre-packaged item which does not display the UPC symbol or other such  symbol capable of being electronically scanned must be individually price(cid:173) marked.   11   "

Sinceramente,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Comisionado              PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,221 feet of 8-inch water main  in S. St. Louis Avenue, from W. 58th Street to W. 59th Street, and in W. 58th Place, from S. Central Park  Avenue to S. St. Louis Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old pipe  dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be completed by  late December. Restoration will follow in late May 2014. Dates may change depending on weather and  other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on St. Louis and 58th Place outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to  reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a  lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are agreeable to  parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water main,  please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and  metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  These screens should be  removed prior to flushing.  This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing  sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line  as a result of the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.      CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN EDWARD M.

The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to reduce  the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only strategy— homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on practical steps (public  and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

St. Louis Avenue (58th St.-59th St.), y en W. 58th Place (Central Park-St. Louis).    Razón:   La cañería principal antigua consiste de tubería de 6 pulgadas y queremos ampliar la  capacidad. Además la tubería antigua se remonta al año 1909 y necesita ser reemplazada.     Horario:   En breve comenzaremos a instalar la nueva cañería de agua y esperamos que el  trabajo sea terminado a fines de diciembre. Restauración seguirá a finales de mayo 2014. Fechas  pueden cambiar dependiendo del tiempo y otros factores. Le notificaremos si hay algún cambio  considerable.     Trafico:   Permitiremos el movimiento de tráfico en St. Louis y en  58th Place fuera de horas de  trabajo. Cuando estamos trabajando en la calle tenemos que cerrar al tráfico por razones de  seguridad. Usted siempre tendrá acceso a su propiedad o negocio incluso si esto significa poner  una placa de metal en lugar. Fuera de horas de trabajo un carril quedara abierto solo para el  tráfico local.    Estacionamiento:   Según lo necesario fijaremos anuncios de “Prohibido Estacionarse” durante  las horas de trabajo. Estamos de acuerdo con el estacionamiento fuera de esas horas, pero  tendremos que insistir que los coches se muevan para el principio del próximo día de trabajo.  Preservaremos tanto estacionamiento como sea posible.     Después de que su antigua cañería de agua ha sido reemplazada y se han conectada a su nueva  cañería de agua, abrir todos los grifos de agua y manguera y enjuague el agua durante 3 a 5 minutos.   Sedimentos y metales se pueden acumular en la pantalla de aireador ubicada en la punta de su grifería.  Estas pantallas se deben retirar antes de que enjuague el agua.  Este lavado ayudará a mantener la calidad  óptima de agua mediante la eliminación de sedimentos, herrumbre o cualquier partículas de plomo que  pueden han soltado de la línea de servicio de agua de la propiedad como resultado de la reemplazando de  la cañería de agua.   Si usted tiene alguna pregunta o inquietud sobre la calidad del agua, por favor  llámenos al 312-744-8190.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to monitor water  usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the water actually used,  encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and number of  plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that with minimal effort,  participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter had not   been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   Homeowner Incentives   rain barrel,        outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org, call 311, or  call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is limited based on funding  availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with the  automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water Management  vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the home.  Bills will be  issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited time offer  of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).        1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water Management  will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of our  water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons per  month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 30% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 10 gallons per  wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically use half  the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20-50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands of gallons  of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by preventing needless  watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million Olympic- sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe water shortages by  2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake Michigan.

MeterSave es un programa para animar a dueños de casa en Chicago a instalar un contador,  voluntariamente, para medir el uso del agua.  Un contador permite a un dueño, sea de una casa singular o  de un edificio de dos pisos, a pagar solamente por el agua usado en realidad, animando esfuerzos para  conservar agua y dinero y protegiendo a la vez uno de nuestros más preciosos recursos naturales.      Las facturas para casas sin contador están basadas en factores como el tamaño del edificio, el tamaño de  la parcela de terreno y el sistema de cañerías y el número de aparatos fijos. Casas con contador pagarán  según el uso preciso del agua.  Esto significa que con esfuerzo mínimo, dueños participantes podrían  ahorrar gastos para el agua.       Incentivos para propietarios   Propietarios sin contadores de agua que participen en MeterSave calificarán para lo siguiente:     Una garantía de 7 años que la factura para el agua no sobrepasará lo que hubiera sido sin contador.   La factura no excederá del precio asignado para ese año.     La elección de uno de los siguientes (mientras que las fuentes duren):     barril para guardar la lluvia    equipo para la conservación de agua fuera de la casa     equipo para la conservación de agua dentro de la casa      ¡La elección de dos de los incentivos mencionados si participan todos los dueños de una  cuadra!     Preguntas frecuentes:   ¿Cómo y cuándo inscribirme en el programa?  Propietarios interesados de casas singulares o de residencias de dos pisos sin contadores de agua pueden  visitar la página de internet www.metersave.org, llamar a 311, o llamar a 312-744-4H2O. Tenga por favor  su número de cuenta de 12 dígitos listo.  El espacio es limitado basado en disponibilidad de la  financiación y el número de voluntarios.    ¿Cuánto costará participar?  El Departamento de Administración de Agua para la Ciudad de Chicago instalará GRATIS un contador  de agua en su casa completo con la tecnología de lectura automática del contador (automatic meter  reading, o AMR).     La tecnología AMR permite que la lectura del contador se transmite a través de una tecnología de radio  inalámbrico a los vehículos de la Administración de Agua mientras pasan por las casas, y así se evita la  necesidad de leer el contador dentro de la casa. Las facturas se le pasarán cada dos meses y reflejarán sólo  la cantidad real de agua usada.      ¿Tengo que tener mi cuenta para agua al corriente?  Sí. Propietarios tienen que tener su cuenta o su plan de pagos al corriente para poder participar en esta   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1       oferta por tiempo limitado de una garantía de 7 años.      Para información sobre un plan de pagos, llame al 312-744-4H20 (4426).     ¿Cuándo puedo conseguir un contador?  La previsión en línea de la instalación del contador está disponible en www.metersave.org.  Si no,  Administración de Agua le llamará para hacer una cita para la instalación del contador.        Cambios pequeños adoptados por la gente en Chicago pueden tener un impacto tremendo en  mantener el suministro sostenible de agua, como:     Cerrar el agua mientras lavando los dientes o afeitándose. Esto puede ahorrar más que 500   galones cada mes por cada persona.     Instalar inodoros de alta eficacia. Inodoros consumen 26% del agua usada en casa. Un inodoro que   pierde agua desperdicia 200 galones de agua cada día.     Instalar lavadoras de alta eficacia. Esto puede ahorrar energía y el consumo de agua.    Llenar el lavatorio con agua para lavar platos en vez de lavarlos bajo agua abierta. Esto ahorra 10   galones cada vez.     Si tiene un lavaplatos, que se llene antes de prenderlo. Los lavaplatos típicamente usan la mitad de   la energía, un sexto del agua, y menos jabón comparado con lavando los platos en el lavatorio.     Trabajar con plantas indígenas de Chicago en su jardín. Esto puede reducir la cantidad de agua   usada afuera entre 20% y 50%.     Usar barriles para guardar la lluvia, para regar el césped y el jardín.    Usar un temporizador o un sensor de lluvia para controlar el riego del césped. Sistemas para regar   gastan miles de galones de agua cada ciclo. Instalar un temporizador o un sensor evitará el riego  innecesario y ahorrará dinero y agua.       AGUA   Nuestro Recurso Más Precioso    El Lago Michigan ha perdido casi 32 trillones de galones de agua – el equivalente de más que 45 millones   de piscinas olímpicas – en la última década. Nuestra región podría enfrentarse a una falta de agua en el   año 2050 si no logramos tomar acción decisiva.      Más que la mitad del consumo de agua en Chicago ocurre en las casas.   Más que 5.4 millones de personas, igual a 44% de la población del estado de Illinois, cuentan con el   Departamento de Administración de Agua en Chicago para el suministro fiable de agua potable del Lago   Michigan.         ¡Inscríbase hoy por un contador para ahorrar agua y dinero!

The project is being constructed to reduce flooding in the Albany Park Neighborhood.  Major  storm events in 2008 and 2013 highlighted the significant flood risk posed by the Chicago River  in this area.  Following the April 2013 flood, Mayor Emanuel along with state, Federal and local  agencies developed a plan to divert excess flood water from the Chicago River to the North  Shore Channel.       What is the project about?      During flood events, excess river water will be diverted into an 18-foot diameter tunnel via an  inlet structure located near Springfield Avenue along the south bank of the river within a small  section of undeveloped Chicago Park District land.  The tunnel will run 150 feet below Foster  Avenue eastward approximately 5,800 feet to an outlet structure in River Park along the east  bank of the North Shore Channel.  Two large shafts will be excavated through soil and rock to  the base of the tunnel.  The tunnel will be excavated using a Tunnel Boring Machine.  The rock  excavated during the tunneling will be removed from the outlet shaft at River Park and  removed from the site.  Once the tunnel construction is completed, the two park areas will be  restored.  The park on Foster Avenue at Springfield will become a new park amenity which was  previously used only for Park District stockpiles and maintenance.  The park area at River Park  will include a new well drained baseball field and regulation soccer field.        Who is doing the work?   The project is being undertaken by the City of Chicago.  The Chicago Department of  Transportation (CDOT) is the lead City agency in charge of the project.  The project is funded  using a combination of funds from the City of Chicago, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation  District of Greater Chicago (MWRDGC), Illinois Department of Natural Resources and U.S.  Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The two construction work areas are on  property owned by the Chicago Park District.  Kenny Construction is the construction contractor  and WSP – Parsons Brinkerhoff is CDOT’s construction management consultant.        When will the construction be happening?   Work will begin in May 2016 and continue for two years.  During the spring and summer of  2016, work will include setting up the construction work areas and excavating the inlet and  outlet shafts.  The tunneling work will start in late fall 2016 and continue through late 2017.   The inlet and outlet structures will be constructed in 2017 with final construction and site  restoration finishing in spring 2018.        Where will the work be done?   There will be two construction sites located on Chicago Park District property.  The main  construction site is located at the north end of River Park, immediately south of Foster Avenue  on the east bank of the channel.  This site includes the outlet shaft and structure and will be the  location of most of the tunnel excavation activities.  The inlet structure site is located north of  Foster Avenue near the Springfield Avenue intersection.      The tunnel will be located under Foster Avenue.  There will be no construction or lane closures  on Foster Avenue itself.  Trucks will use Foster Avenue to remove tunnel rock and bring in  materials for the construction.  Worker parking will be within the contractor’s work area and  not on residential streets.  The existing bike path in River Park will be temporarily closed during  construction and a new path and pedestrian crossing signal will be added temporarily across  Foster Avenue.        How will the shafts and tunnel be built?   The shafts will be excavated vertically through approximately 70 feet of soil and 75 to 100 feet  of rock.  Sheet piling or other earth retention systems will be used to support the surrounding  soils throughout construction.  The rock will be excavated using controlled blasting overseen by  an Illinois licensed blaster and an independent blasting consultant.  The contract includes  stringent specifications regarding safety, vibration and noise limits, vibration and settlement  monitoring as well as a public awareness program to inform the community of blasting  activities.     Most of the tunnel will be excavated using a tunnel boring machine, or TBM.  The TBM is a very  large mechanical device which bores through the rock and removes the chipped rock through a  conveyance system back through the tunnel and up the shaft at River Park.  The excavated  material is then loaded on trucks and removed.  Over 100 truck trips will be required daily   during full tunnel mining operations.    Once the tunnel is excavated, the exposed rock will be stabilized using steel rock bolts, grouted  as needed to reduce groundwater seepage into the tunnel and lined with concrete for long  term stability.           Has this type of work been done before in Chicago?   More Detailed Questions……   The City of Chicago and MWRDGC have constructed numerous tunnels over many decades for  stormwater and potable water conveyance.  MWRDGC has constructed over 109 miles of rock  tunnels as part of the Deep Tunnel project.  The Albany Park tunnel contractor has constructed  many tunnels nationally and in Chicago including most recently the three mile long MWRDGC  39th Street tunnel.       What about blasting noise and vibration? Will the work damage my house?   Public safety is paramount.  Although the blasting operations will cause vibrations, it is highly  unlikely that it will cause damage to adjacent property. However, as a precaution, the  contractor will conduct a pre-construction settlement survey of private properties within 500  feet of the blasting locations.  Throughout the project, the settlement, vibration, and noise  levels will be continuously monitored. If the levels exceed specified stringent thresholds, the  construction team will take steps to mitigate the noise and vibrations. .   How will residents be notified about blasting and other construction activities?   A public information meeting will be scheduled through the Alderman’s office for your ward.   Additionally, project information and schedule will be posted on the ward website in advance  of major construction operations.  During blasting, a horn alert warning system will be  implemented in conjunction with warning signage to alert the nearby public of an impending  blast.  Blasting will be scheduled once per day, only during weekday, daytime hours,  approximately every other day.   How will dust be controlled?   Housekeeping of the project site and impacted roadway will be monitored and addressed to  minimize the dust from trucking and construction operations.   How much additional truck traffic will there be?   There will be a higher than normal volume of truck traffic on Foster during daytime hours due  to the removal and delivery of materials, but there are no plans to restrict or close lanes on  Foster Avenue or any of the cross streets. The project team is currently coordinating with Office  of Emergency Management and Communication (OEMC) to address the possibility of the higher  volumes increasing travel times.     Which wards are involved?   The project involves three aldermanic wards – the 33rd (Deborah Mell), the 39th (Margaret  Laurino) and the 40th ward (Patrick O’Connor).     How will the community be protected from flooding until the tunnel is finished?   Stating in May 2016, City forces will be constructing a temporary flood barrier wall along Foster  Avenue and the south side of the Chicago River to reduce flooding risk while the tunnel is being  constructed.  This wall will consist of concrete jersey barriers and sand bags.  This work will be  completed in June 2016.  City agencies will continually monitor the river levels and take   necessary steps to minimize flooding risk during construction.  The general alignment is shown  below.   How will I cross Foster Avenue at the park during construction?    Foster Avenue and all intersection crosswalks are scheduled to be open throughout  construction, with the exception of Foster and Avers.  At the intersection of Foster and Avers,  CDOT will be installing a traffic signal, ADA ramps, and roadway resurfacing, crosswalk detours  will be provided while this intersection is being improved.    Additionally a crosswalk and signal will be installed at the intersection of Virginia across Foster  for bicyclist and pedestrians to cross Foster.   What will the sites look like once construction is complete?   Once the tunnel construction is completed, the two park areas will be completely restored.   Eugene Park on Foster Avenue at Springfield will become a new park amenity which was  previously used only for Park District stockpiles and maintenance, new entrances and pathways  will offer a renewed functionality of the park space for the public.   The park area at River Park  will include a new well drained baseball field with new fencing and backstop, a regulation  soccer field, and new bicycle and pedestrian pathways.   What is the cost of this project?   $70 Million   How can I get more information?   A public information meeting will be scheduled for this summer before any blasting occurs  through the Alderman’s office for your ward.  Regular project information and schedule  updates will also be provided through your ward office.

On November 8,  2001,  Board  staff  inaugural party for [the company  advised  you  by  telephone  that  the  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  you  from  accepting  the  tickets;  this  letter  is  provided  pursuant  to  your  request  on  November 13, 2001  for a written statement in that regard.   You  stated  that  in  your  capacity  as  Assistant  Commissioner  for  the  ], you supervise the performance of [the  Collective  [Department  1  ],  a  private company that is  responsible  for  maintenance  of   public facilities (restrooms, concourse, walkways, etc.) at the [site   ].  The [companies  ] that use this [site  ] lease space from the City,  but  maintenance  for  their facilities  is  the  responsibility  of the  [companies]  themselves,which hire their own cleaning companies.  You are  not  involved  in the negotiation of the leases (this  is  handled by the real  estate division of  the [Department 1  ])  or  for  the  supervision  or  oversight  of the  leased  ]  ],  and   facilities.  You stated that you also represent the [Department 1   in  meetings  with  Federal  agencies  at  the  [site  oversee the City's security arrangements at the  [site].   You and several other [Department 1  to  attend  an  inaugural  party  for  [the  company  2001  at Navy Pier.  Other attendees included [   ] employees were invited  ]  held  on  August  1,   ] .  You estimate  that there were approximately 200 people at the party.  Upon your arrival at  the function you signed a card, which was then placed in a box.  At the end  of the  evening,  an  that  seven  prizes  of  round   announcement  was  made   trips for   two to   Case No. 01050.Q  December 19, 2001  Page 2   [A  ]  would  be  awarded.  The  tickets  were  awarded  by  a  random  drawing  of the  cards that guests had filled out upon arrival.  Winners had to  be present to  win the  tickets.  You  stated  that you won the  seventh and  last set of tickets  of the  evening  (yours  was  the  fourteenth  name  called  in  the  last  drawing).  All  tickets  were  donated  by  the  [Hotel  R,  the  Hotel  S,  the  Hotel  T,  and  Companies  U  and  V].  To  your  knowledge,  the  only  company  that  has  any  relationship with the  City is  [Company A  ],  which leases  space  at  [the  site ].  You stated that  you  had  no  role  in  leasing  this  space  to  the  company  and  make  no  decisions  concerning  [the  company   ] in your City employment.   The  Ordinance  provision  most  relevant  to  your  question  is  Sec.  2-156-040,  which  states,  in  relevant part:   (b)  No  person shall  give  or offer to  give to  any  official,  employee  or  City  contractor,  or  to  the  spouse  or  minor  child  of either  of  them,  and none  of them shall  accept,  anything of value,  including,  but not  limited to,  a  gift,  favor  or promise  of future  employment,  based  upon  any  mutual  understanding,  either  explicit  or  implicit,  that  the  votes,  official  actions,  decisions  or  judgments  of  any  official,  employee  or  City  contractor,  concerning  the  business  of  the  City  would  be  influenced thereby.  It shall  be  presumed  that  a  nonmonetary  gift  having  a  value  of  less  than  $50.00  does  not  involve such an understanding.   (c)  No  person  who  has  an  economic  interest  in  a  specific  City  business,  service  or  regulatory  transaction  shall  give,  directly  or  indirectly,  to  any  City  official  or  employee  whose  decision  or  action may substantially affect such transaction, or to the spouse or  minor  child  of such  official  or employee,  and  none  of them  shall  accept,  any  gift of (i)  cash or its  equivalent regardless  of value,  or  (ii)  an  item  or  service  other  than  an  occasional  one  of nominal  value (less than $50.00) provided, however, nothing herein shall be  construed  to  prohibit  such  person  from  accepting  gifts  from  relatives.   While  Sec.  2-156-040(b)  prohibits  a  City  employee  from  accepting  anything  of value  (which  would  include  airline  tickets)  based  upon  any  mutual  understanding  that  his  official  actions,  decisions  or  judgments  concerning  the  business  of  the  City  would  be  influenced  by  such  acceptance, the random nature of your selection as a winner from among the 200 (by your count)  persons  in  attendance  at  the  party  tends  to  rule  out  any  intent  to  specifically  influence  your  actions  as  a  City  employee.  (See  Case No. 00022.Q,  where  the  Board  addressed  the  issue  of a  City employee whose name was  chosen  in a random drawing for  free  registration to  an annual   Case No. 01050.Q  December 19, 200 1  Page 3   conference  of a  professional  organization,  valued  at  $800.00.  The  Board  determined  that  the  Ordinance  did  not  prohibit  the  employee  from  accepting  the  free  registration,  as  the  random  nature  of the  drawing  ruled  out  any  intent  to  influence  any  of the  employee's  governmental  actions  in  violation  of Sec.  2-156-040.  See  also  Case  No.  90022.A,  where  staff advised  an  employee  who  had  won  an  $800.00  gift  certificate  in  a  drawing  that  the  random  nature  of the  drawing tended to rule out intent to specifically influence her actions as a City employee.)   Sec.  2-156-040(c) prohibits an employee from accepting any ""gift"" from  any person who  has  an  economic  interest  in  a  specific  City  business,  service  or  regulatory  transaction,  when  the  employee's decision  or action may  substantially affect  such a transaction.  You  have  said that  you make no  decisions and take no  actions in your City position that would affect any economic  interest that any of the prize donors  have in any City business,  service or regulatory transaction.  Therefore, under this section the acceptance of the tickets is not prohibited.   Therefore, based on previous Board opinions and the facts  you have presented, it is  Board staffs  opinion  that  the  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  you  from  accepting  the  tickets  you  won  in  the  drawing.   Staffs opinion is  not necessarily dispositive  of all  issues  relevant to  this  situation,  but is  based  solely on the  application of the City's Governmental Ethics  Ordinance to  the  facts  stated in this  opinion.  If the  facts  stated  are  incorrect  or  incomplete,  please  notify  us  immediately,  as  any  change may alter our opinion.  Other laws or rules  also may apply to this situation.  Be  advised  that City departments have the authority to  adopt and enforce rules  of conduct that may be  more  restrictive than the limitations imposed by the Ethics Ordinance.   We  appreciate your inquiry  and  your  concern to  abide  by the  standards  embodied in the  Ethics  Ordinance.  We enclose a copy of the Ordinance for your convenience.  If you have any further  questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.   Very truly yours,   ]   [signature  John H.  Mathews  Legal Counsel   Approved by:   ]   [signature  Dorothy J.
