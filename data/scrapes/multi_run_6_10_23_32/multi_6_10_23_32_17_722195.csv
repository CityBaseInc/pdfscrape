In late July, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin  preliminary construction work around Schubert and Hamlin. Following, in mid-September,  the Department of Water Management’s crews will begin work to install a new sewer main  in W. Schubert Avenue (Hamlin-Monticello). The old sewer dates back to 1904 and needs to  be replaced.      When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will  be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    31st Ward Office: 773-278-0031    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner

Superfine, Legal Counsel Courtney L.D. Kimble, Attorney/Investigator Edward Primer, Program Director Paully Casillas, Staff Assistant  The Board VOTED 4-0 (Michael F. Quirk, absent) to approve the Open Session Minutes of the August 18, 2010 meeting.   II.  Chair’s Report  None.   III.  Executive Director’s Report       A.  Education–Classes  We have resolved the glitches in the mandatory 4 year education notification system. There are currently 25 persons scheduled for class on September 23, 32 on October 7, 34 on October 21, and 39 on November 4.     On  September  1,  staff  presented  a  90  minute  session  to  all  21  employees  of  the Office of Compliance, at the request of its Acting Executive Director.  On September 13, staff presented a 45 minute session to the 9 Commissioners of the Old Town Park SSA, and 2 employees of its Service Provider, at the request of the Chair of that Commission.  On September 20, staff will again make a 25 minute presentation at New Employee Orientation.  About 60 employees are scheduled to attend.  On September 24, staff will present the third of 4 classes to about 225 Department of Aviation contractors at O’Hare, at the request of the Commissioner of Aviation.  Open Session Minutes September 15, 2010 Page 2  B.  Education–Mandatory Annual Ethics Education  I’m pleased to announce that, to date, we are at 71% compliance City-wide with the 2010  all-employee  online  training:  33,673  employees  scheduled,  and  23,844 completions. 6 of 50 aldermen have completed their training to date.  As to lobbyist training, to date, 75 lobbyists have completed the program–about 13% of the expected total.  C.  Statements of Financial Interests  To date, there remain 17 employees and 8 appointed officials who have yet to file their 2010 forms as required by law.  We are at 99% compliance.  There will be more on these individuals in closed session.  To date in 2010, the office has collected $11,680 late filing fees.  Staff is working diligently on the on-line filing, retrieval, and data processing system for Statements of Financial Interests. The project is now well into the user testing phase.    We are making arrangements to post on our website the filed 2010 Statements as well, and expect this to be accomplished in the next month.  D.  Lobbyist Registration  There are currently 547 lobbyists that have registered with the City for this year.  To date,  $272,775.00  in  lobbyist  registration  fees  have  been  deposited  with  the Department of Revenue.  July 20, was the deadline for lobbyists to file their semi-annual activity reports.  To date, we have received approximately 85% of these reports. In accordance with the Ordinance, staff will send out any and all required delinquency notices to lobbyists.  E.  Illinois Freedom of Information Act  Since  the  last  regularly  scheduled  Board  meeting,  the  office  has  received  1  new request  under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act:  for  6  lobbyists’  filings  for  years varying within ranges from 2003-2010, resulting in production of 36 records and copying of 2 of the pages from those records.  Open Session Minutes September 15, 2010 Page 3  F.  2011 Budget  The Board submitted its budget request in early August, and met with officials from the Budget Office on August 25.  There will be more on this in closed session.  G.  Candidates  Given the large number of candidates who have declared and are likely to declare their  candidacy  for  elected  City  Office,  staff  has  posted  detailed  information regarding the Campaign Financing Ordinance on the Board’s  website, and delivered 550 Candidate’s packets to the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, whose personnel distribute them to candidates and their representatives.  To date, we have received only 3 filed forms, plus one request for an extension.  All these forms are open for public inspection as well.  IV. Old Business  None.  V.  New Business  H.  Employee  Compensation  Level  for  Requirement  to  File  Statement  of Financial Interests in 2010  The  Board  reviewed  staff’s  recommendation  regarding  the  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance-mandated increase in the rate requiring employee filing of a Statement of Financial  Interests  with  the  Board.  The  Board  VOTED  4-0  (Michael  F.  Quirk, absent) to approve the staff recommendation: the 2011 rate is $79,300.00.  I.  Semi-Annual Review of the Confidentiality of Executive Session Minutes Under the Illinois Open Meetings Act  It was announced that, during the executive session, Board members would conduct the semi-annual review of Board executive session minutes as required by the Illinois Open Meetings Act, and would reconvene in open session to confirm the Board’s determination in executive session.  Open Session Minutes September 15, 2010 Page 4  J.  Public Notice of 2011 Board of Ethics Meeting Schedule  The Board considered staff’s proposed 2011 schedule of regularly-scheduled Board of  Ethics  meetings.    The  Board  then  VOTED  4-0  (Michael  F.  Quirk,  absent)  to approve the staff recommendation as follows:  Wednesday, January 19 Wednesday, February 16 Wednesday, March 16 Wednesday, April 13 Wednesday, May 18 Wednesday, June 15  Wednesday, July 20 Wednesday, August 17 Wednesday, September 14 Wednesday, October 19 Wednesday, November 16 Wednesday, December 14  All meetings will be held at 3:00 p.m. at the Board of Ethics, 740 North Sedgwick, Suite 500, Chicago, Illinois 60654.  K.  Posting Candidates Statement of Financial Interests Forms  The Executive Director discussed the idea of posting on the Board’s web site all Candidates’ Statements of Financial Interests filed with the Board, in the interest of greater  transparency  (and  given  that  the  agency  can  do  this  itself).    After  brief discussion, the Board’s consensus is that this is a good idea, but would like to discuss the idea in greater detail at the October meeting to set protocols for posting.  The Board VOTED 4-0 (Michael F. Quirk, absent) to adjourn into Executive Session at 3:21 p.m. to review matters concerning the conduct of employees and officials of the City that could result in their  discipline  or  dismissal,  to  review  questions  concerning  matters  of  professional  ethics  and performance, to review matters in which litigation is ongoing, and/or to review matters in which the Board finds that litigation against or affecting the Board is probable or imminent.  VI. New Business (Reconvened)  L.  Semi-annual Review of the Confidentiality of Executive Session Minutes under the Illinois Open Meetings Act.  At 4:49 p.m. the Board reconvened in open session to confirm its poll in Executive Session on the confidentiality of the Executive Session Minutes.  The Board VOTED 4-0 (Michael F. Quirk, absent) to confirm that the Executive Session Minutes of the Board from August 1987 to September 2010 remain confidential, on the ground that the need for confidentiality still exists as to those minutes, with the exception of those that have already been made publicly available by vote of the Board.  The Board VOTED 4-0 (Michael F. Quirk, absent) to adjourn.  bd-10-27-10.os.wpd

Among other things:                              CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                51ST ST. WATER PROJECT  PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,837 feet of 16-inch  water main in W. 51st Street, S. Wallace Street to S. Shields Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of an 8-inch water main and we want to expand capacity.  Further, the old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by late May 2013. Restoration (to be completed by the Norfolk Southern  Railway Company) will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If  there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. 51st Street outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN PAT DOWELL    773- 373-9273                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main installation is slated to conclude in  late May 2013. Restoration (to be completed by the Norfolk Southern Railway Company) will  follow. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors  like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!
