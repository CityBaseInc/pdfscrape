By late March 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and NPL Construction Company  crews will begin the work to install 2,611 feet of new 8-inch water main in N. Bell Avenue, from   W. Jarvis Avenue to W. Touhy Avenue, N. Hamilton Avenue, from 200 feet north of W. Chase  Avenue to W. Touhy Avenue and N. Oakley Avenue, from W. Chase Avenue to W. Touhy Avenue.   The old water main dates back to 1908, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  49th Ward Office: 773-338-5796  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    •  When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

On July 26, 2010, you sent us an email, dated June 20, 2010, from the  [sponsor].  The [Sponsor] has invited you, on behalf of the [Co-sponsor I]  “CS1”)  and  the  [Co-sponsor  II](“CS2”),  to  attend  the  [Conference],  which will be held in [Foreign City], September 29th to October 1, 2010.   According  to  the  materials  you  sent  us,  other  [members  of  your  profession]  have  been  extended  the  same  invitation.    Your  expenses,  including  round-trip  Chicago-[Foreign  City]  coach  airfare,  four  nights  accommodation,  show  registration  and  admission  tickets  to  all  fair  events,  will  be  paid  jointly  by  CS1and  CS2.    You  have  asked  staff  whether  the  City’s  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  prohibits  you  from  accepting this offer.    [Conference],  which  is  held  annually,  is  the  world’s  largest  [profession  specific  conference],  drawing  representatives  of  over  800  [related  professionals] worldwide.  In fact, this is the 9th consecutive [Conference]  to which you or other [CD] personnel have been invited, and that we  have  addressed.  At  [Conference],  you  will  have  the  opportunity  to  improve  your  knowledge  of  and  leading  [professionals] in the [content area] world, as well as sharing ideas and  experiences  with  fellow  [members  of  your  profession].    You  told  staff  that  your  attendance  at  [Conference]  would  benefit  the  City  and  enhance  your  ability  to  perform  your  City  duties,  and  that  you  have  already received approval for attendance from the [CD] Commissioner  and your immediate [CD] supervisors.    In  addition  to  this,  this  year  [Co-Sponsor  III  (“CS3)]  is  giving  its  third  [member of the profession] of the Year Award, which will be bestowed  upon  an  American  [member  of  the  profession]  responsible  for  a  [materials]  in  his  or  her  [workplace],  and  whose  work  has  been  noticeable during the year.  You will be able to vote for your candidate  by sending the Commission an email with the name of the [member of  the profession] of your choice and if you so wish, the reason why you   familiarity  with   the   of   on      profession]   in   the   [Conference],   are  recommending  that  person.  The  deadline  for  casting  votes  is  September 15th, 2010.  From all recommendations, five finalists will be  selected, and the winner will announced during the presentation of the   [members  the  morning of September 29th. The award will consist of $2,500 and a check will be given  to the winner at that time.  This year, the hosts will be publishing the second volume of  the  [Professional  publication],  and  they  sent  you  a  form  to  fill  out  with  at  least  one   recommendation,  to  be  included  in  the  guide,  which  will  be  presented  during  [Conference].     Under § 2-156-040(d) of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance, City employees are  not  prohibited  from  accepting  hosting  expenses,  including  travel,  meals  and  entertainment,  if:  (1)  the  expenses  are  reasonable;  (2)  the  expenses  are  furnished  in  connection  with  public  events,  appearances  or  ceremonies  related  to  official  City  business; (3) the expenses are furnished by the sponsor of the public event; and (4) the  offer is not based upon any mutual understanding that the official decisions or actions  of any City employee concerning the business of the City would be influenced.    Based on our review of the written invitation materials you sent us, staff concludes that  all  the  conditions  listed  in  §  -040(d)  of  the  Ordinance  are  met,  and  thus  that  the  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  you  from  accepting  these  travel  and  hosting  expenses.   Our  conclusion  is  consistent  with  advice  we  have  given  to  you  and  other  similarly  situated  employees  in  the  past.  (See  Case  Nos.  09035.Q,  08042.A,  07036.Q,  06041.Q,  05049.Q, 04038.Q, 03039Q.and 02029.Q). As you noted in your email (and as we have  advised  you  in  past  years),  you  will,  as  a  matter  of  policy,  seek  the  approval  of  the  Mayor’s Chief of Staff for this trip, seeing that it is for overseas travel.  Further, based on  our review of the written invitation materials you sent us, there would be no prohibition  on  accepting  the  award  if  a  Chicago  [member  of  your  profession]  won  the  [professional] Award described above.      Staff’s conclusion does not necessarily dispose of all issues relevant to this situation, and  is based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the  facts stated in this letter.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify us  immediately,  as  any  change  may  alter  our  conclusion.    Other  laws  or  rules  also  may  apply to this situation.  Be advised that City departments have the authority to adopt  and enforce rules of conduct that may be more restrictive than the limitations imposed  by the Ordinance.    We appreciate your inquiry and your concern to abide by the standards embodied in  the Ordinance.  If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.    Very truly yours,      Steven I. Berlin  Executive Director         Case No. 10038.Q  July 27, 2010  Page 3
