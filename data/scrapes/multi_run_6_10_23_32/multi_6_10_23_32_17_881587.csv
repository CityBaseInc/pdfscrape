I want to be certain you are well  informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you have any  questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,154 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Harper  Avenue, from E. 70th Street to E. 71st Street and in S. Dante Ave., from E. 70th  Street to E. 71st Street.  The old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Hairston’s office, and she has made clear we  are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.       Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner      cc:   Alderman Leslie A. Hairston            5th Ward                                                   Do you wonder what was happening in 1890?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                 CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                    HARPER AVE. AND DANTE AVE. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,154 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Harper Avenue, from E. 70th Street to E. 71st Street and in S. Dante Avenue,  from E. 70th Street to E. 71st Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late May 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.     Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Harper Ave. and Dante Ave. outside of our working  hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety.  You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate  in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.  .   Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      ALDERMAN LESLIE A. HAIRSTON   773-324-5555   3-1-1               ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late May 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

22852`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxRulingsandRegulations/TransTaxRuling5.pdf`Success`Success`3`3`Not a fillable PDF.`CITY OF CHICAGO   DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE   PERSONAL PROPERTY LEASE TRANSACTION TAX RULING   Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax Ruling #5  Subject: Usage of Computers and Computer Software  Effective date:  June 1, 2004    Formerly Ruling #9  Original effective date:  February 1, 1987  Amended:  February 15, 1988     TIME-SHARING                  Section 1.   Pursuant to section 3-32-030(A) of the Chicago Municipal Code     (“Code”), the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax (the “lease tax” or “tax”)  is imposed upon (1) the lease or rental in the City of personal property, or (2) the  privilege of using in the City personal property that is leased or rented outside the City.   Leased time on a computer is subject to the tax.  Section 3-32-020(H).  This includes the  time-sharing of a computer with other users.   For time-sharing purposes (where the  possession of the computer is not transferred), the user of the computer shall be deemed  using the computer at the location of the user's access terminal to the computer.   Therefore, if the user's terminal is within the City of Chicago, the lease tax will apply to  all charges for the use of the computer and its software, which is accessed by the user at  such terminal.  However, charges for the storage of information on the computer by the  user, which will be used at a later date by the user, and not in the immediate processing of  information, shall be deemed a usage of the computer at the computer location and not at  the access terminal; because this is not an actual use of the computer by means of an  access terminal but instead is a charge for storage at the computer location.  If at a later  date, a charge is made for accessing the stored information from a terminal located in  Chicago, such access charge would be taxable.     PRINTING   Section 2.   Charges for printing services or other services, provided that such     charges are not for the use of any personal property and are separately stated and  optional, are not  subject to the lease tax.  See Chicago Personal Property Lease  Transaction Tax Ruling #2004-3, which explains in general that a separately stated and  optional charge for services is excluded from tax.     COMPUTERS   Section 3.   Where the actual possession, but not title or ownership, of a     computer is transferred to a user for use in the City of Chicago, for consideration, such a  transaction is a lease subject to the  lease tax.  The tax will be due for all lease or rental  charges associated with the usage of the computer and its software in the City of Chicago.    Separately stated optional charges not for the use of the computer, its software or other  personal property used in the City shall not be subject to the lease tax.  An example  would be separately stated maintenance charges, if the charges are optional.     COMPUTER SOFTWARE      Section 4.      The lease or rental of computer software in the City of Chicago is  subject to the lease tax.  The sale of computer software is not subject to the lease tax.  To  determine whether a lease or rental of software occurs, the test is whether the use or  possession of such software is transferred for a consideration.  This would include all  agreements for the use or possession of such software including license agreements.  If  copyright licenses, waivers or releases are given along with the use of such software, this  will not affect the taxability of the transfer because such copyright licenses, waivers or  releases are a necessary part of the software being leased or rented.  Software under  copyright cannot be used without such licenses, waivers or releases.  Therefore, the fact  that a copyright license, waiver or release is given in a transaction will not affect its  taxability.  However, if title or ownership of the software passes in an agreement then a  sale occurs and no  lease tax would be due.  (Note: (1) If optional charges for update  services or other services are involved in the rental, and if these charges are not charges  for the use of any personal property, these charges may be separately stated and excluded  from the tax; (2) For time-sharing of software when no possession is transferred see  Sections 1 and 2 above.)    Examples of the application of Section 4:      an agreement called a copyright license agreement which transfers the possession and use  of certain software to the user, and allows such user to use such software on a month to  month basis for a payment of a specific monthly fee.  No other fees are charged the user.   At the end of the contract term or upon cancellation by the parties, the software is either  returned to the owner (or licensor) or erased.  Only incidental training and a question  answering service is provided and is a part of the monthly fee.  In this case, the total  monthly fee is taxable as a lease charge for the use of the software.      t that the agreement provides for an  indefinite use of the software for a flat fee of $2,000.00.  The user does not have to return  the software but can use the software for as long as he or she desires.  In this case, an  ownership interest in the software is transferred, so no tax is due.      monthly reports and the use of the owner's (or licensor's) personnel for training and  possible modification of the software are provided.  In such cases, if charges for such  services are separately stated and optional and are not charges for the use of any  additional personal property, such service charges are not taxable.     Same facts as (a.) above, except that update services such as   r licensor) and a Chicago user sign    (b)   Same facts as (a.) above, excep   (a)   A computer software owner (o   (c)    (d)   that in addition to the software   Same facts as (a) above, except     being leased, the owner (or licensor) agrees to customize the software for a specific fee.   The fee is a separately stated flat fee for the service of customizing the software, and the  fee is paid either in lump sum payment or in installments.  Accordingly, the monthly fee  for the use of the software is not increased for the customizing charge.  In such a case, the  monthly fee for the use of the software is taxable, but the charge for the customizing is  not.  If the customizing charge were incorporated into the monthly fee or otherwise  treated as part of the property being leased, in that the charge varies with the period of  use of the property, then the entire customizing charge would be taxable.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,378 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Oakdale Avenue, from  N. Lakewood Avenue to N. Seminary Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1911, and needs to be  replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Tunney’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Tom Tunney             44th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                Do you wonder what was happening in 1911?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       LUCILLE BALL                   Crisco, the all-vegetable shortening, was introduced.    On November 11, a record cold snap (later known as The Great Blue Norther 11/11/11)  hit the midwest United States. Many cities broke record highs and lows on the same day.     The Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre. It was recovered in 1913.    Ground breaking began in Boston for Fenway Park.    An audience threw vegetables at actors for the first recorded time in the U.S.    Lucille Ball was born.    The South Pole was reached for the first time, by Norwegian Roald Amundsen.                         WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,378 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Oakdale Avenue, from N. Lakewood Avenue to N. Seminary Avenue.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1911 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in July. Restoration will follow in August. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN TOM TUNNEY   773-525-6034      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE          312-742-1029                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in July. Restoration  will be completed in August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Currently, the risk of influenza infection in the Chicago area is low.  Nationally, influenza activity has also remained relatively  low.  To date, less than two percent of the 31,163 specimens tested for influenza at collaborating laboratories across the U.S. have  been positive, with 88% of these being  influenza A (44% subtyped as A (H3)).   Since October 2011, all viruses tested for antivi- ral resistance have been susceptible to the antiviral medications oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) and zanamivir (Relenza®).  However,   rare sporadic cases of oseltamivir resistant 2009 H1N1 and A (H3N2) viruses have been detected worldwide.  Vaccination is the  best way to protect against human seasonal influenza infection and all Chicagoans aged six months and older are encouraged to  get vaccinated. Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  Uninsured individuals  and those with insurance that does not cover flu shots can obtain a voucher for a free flu shot at Walgreens1.  The Chicago Depart- ment of Public Health has influenza vaccine available at CDPH immunization clinics2.      Figure 1. Weekly reported percent of emergency department visits  attributed to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current  season (2011-2012) and previous two seasons, October-May.   Are severe cases of influenza occurring?                                                                                                                                             No influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were re- ported for week 1 (January 1-7, 2012).  Since October  2011, one influenza-associated ICU hospitalization has  been reported.  Suspected novel influenza, pediatric influ- enza-associated deaths, and influenza-associated ICU  hospitalizations should all be reported to CDPH via  INEDSS3.  Outbreaks of influenza-like illness in a congre- gate setting are also reportable; in Chicago these reports  can be made by phone to (312) 746-5911.         Figure 2. Weekly reported percent of outpatient clinic visits attributed  to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current season (2011- 2012) and previous season (Chicago and Illinois), October-May.   How much influenza-like illness is occurring?            For the week of January 1-7, 2012, with 16 hospitals re- porting, 3.1% of emergency room visits were due to ILI  (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with cough or sore throat).  This is lower than levels reported during the same surveil- lance week in 2010 and is a two percentage point  de- crease from the previous week (Figure 1).  From January  1-7, 2012, with 16 outpatient clinics reporting, 3.0% of  outpatient clinic visits were due to ILI.  This is similar to  levels reported during the same surveillance week in 2010  (Figure 2).     Which influenza strains are circulating?                      Data on influenza virus test results are reported by Chi- cago laboratories performing influenza subtyping.  For  the week of January 1-7, 2012, with 4 laboratories report- ing, 4 of 208 specimens tested for influenza were posi- tive, all subtyped as human influenza A (H3N2).  Since  October 2011, 9 out of 1,986 specimens tested for influ- enza have been positive,  with 6 typed as influenza A (5  H3 and 1 not subtyped) and 3 typed as influenza B.       Where can I get more information?                            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Flu- View4 report provides national updates and trends related  to the intensity of influenza activity across the United  States, as well as detailed information on antiviral resis- tance, severity of illness, and other topics.

Western Ave.    November 2017      November is Pet Cancer    Awareness Month!       Wonder how you can reduce the risk of cancer for your pet? Know  the facts!     According to the Animal Cancer Foundation, here are three things  every pet owner should know!    1.  Cancer is the number one disease-related cause of death for   dogs in the United States.   2.  One in five cats will develop cancer in their lifetime.  3.  Cancer accounts for almost 50 percent of deaths in pets more   than 10 years old.      Source: www.acfoundation.org   According to VetInfo, cancer is usually identified by the presence  of a malignant tumor. The most common form of cancer in cats is  lymphoma. Older dogs are usually more affected by cancer than  younger dogs. If you notice a fast growing mass on your pet,  especially one that bleeds, or a loss of weight and appetite, you  should visit your vet right away.    Source: www.vetinfo.com     How can you help your pet?    The best way to beat cancer in your pet is early detection and  treatment. Depending on the type of cancer, treatment options  might include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. You  can also reduce your pet’s risk of cancer by keeping them at a  healthy weight, limiting their exposure to carcinogens and other  toxins, visiting a vet for regular checkups, and spaying/neutering  your pet!                       Live Like Roo: Helping Pets with Cancer    Live Like Roo is a Chicago-based charitable  foundation that helps dogs (and their owners)  through a pet’s cancer diagnoses by providing  emotional and financial support. Roo was rescued  from CACC in 2015. When it was discovered he was  suffering from bone cancer, founder Sarah Lauch  created a bucket list for the six months he had left to  live, and called it “Live Like Roo.” “It was a reminder  that we should all live like there is no tomorrow.  Now, we are helping other dogs with cancer do the  same,” said Sarah. Learn more at livelikeroo.org.        UPCOMING EVENTS   @CACC: 2741 S.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,551 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Hirsh Street, from N.  Long Avenue to N. Laramie Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1909, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Mitts’ office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner    cc:   Alderman Emma Mitts                    37th Ward    1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            Do you wonder what was happening in 1909?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:          ERROL FLYNN        The first U.S. university school of nursing was established, at the University of   Minnesota.     Joan of Arc was declared a saint.    The first Lincoln head pennies were minted.    The Indianapolis 500 race track opened.    Actor Errol Flynn was born.    Workers began pouring concrete for the Panama Canal.    The first subway car with side doors went into service in New York City.                         HIRSH ST. WATER PROJECT        PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,551 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Hirsh Street, from N. Long Avenue to N. Laramie Avenue.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late August 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Hirsh Street outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                    CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN EMMA MITTS   773-745-2894                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late August 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

By late October 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,482 feet of new 8-inch water main in E. 85th Street  from S. Burnham Avenue to S. Commercial Avenue, S. Muskegon Avenue, from S. Baltimore Avenue  to E. 85th Street and E. 84th Street, from S. Muskegon Avenue to S. Escanaba Avenue.  The old water  main dates back to 1909, and needs to be replaced.  We expect the water main work to be  completed by mid December 2017. Restoration will follow in mid April 2018. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  7th Ward Office: 773-731-7777      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

Sincerely,   Randy Conner  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:           OUTLAW JESSE JAMES        The world’s first roller skating rink opened in London.    American thoroughbred racehorse Aristides won the first Kentucky Derby.    Bizet’s opera “Carmen” premiered in Paris.    The first organized indoor game of ice hockey was played between two pick-up teams at   the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal.     Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim the English Channel.    Jesse James robbed a train in Otterville, Missouri.    The electric dental drill was patented by George F. Green.                              LOOMIS ST. WATER PROJECT        PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 605 feet of 8-inch water  main in S. Loomis Street, from W. 21st Street to W. Cermak Road.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1875 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late May 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Loomis Street outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                  CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN DANIEL SOLIS   773- 523-4100                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late May 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!
