This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,029 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Palmer Street, from N.  Maplewood Avenue to N. Western Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1887, and needs to be  replaced.

Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                                                        Anne Sullivan began teaching 6 year old, blind and deaf Helen Keller.    Oregon became the first state to make Labor Day a holiday.    Britain celebrated the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.    Susanna Medora Salter was elected the first U.S. woman mayor (Argonia, Kansas).    The fire escape was patented.    Boris Karloff, an icon of horror cinema, was born.            PALMER WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,029 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Palmer Street, from N. Maplewood Avenue to N. Western Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1887 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late April 2013. Restoration will follow in late May 2013. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Palmer outside of our working hours.  When we are  working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able  to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOE MORENO III   773-278-0101                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late April 2013.  Restoration will be completed in late May 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.                Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

In August, the Department of Water Management’s crews will begin work to install a new  sewer main in N. Hamlin Avenue (Irving Park-Elston). The old sewer dates back to 1901  and needs to be replaced.     During construction, we will require a partial closure of Irving Park at Hamlin for a few  days. Detour routes will be posted in advance. Otherwise, when we are working in the  street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always be able to reach your  home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic  only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    45th Ward Office: 773-286-4545    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner

The public chauffeur rules now include a “CH” prefix to each rule and were  amended after notice and comment as follows:   1.  Olive Harvey College, City Colleges of Chicago, is now authorized to  administer public chauffeur training courses and licensing exams for  both taxicab and limo driver applicants.   2.  BACP will no longer administer the licensing exams for taxicab and   limo drivers.   3.  Public chauffeurs may renew their licenses up to 45 days before their   licenses expire.  They no longer need to wait to renew in their birth  month.   4.  Starting immediately, Public chauffeur licensees will be issued with   expiration dates based on the licensee’s birth date – thus licenses will  expire on specific dates throughout the month of birth as Illinois  State driver licenses do.   5.

PAUL, Minn. -- Individuals affected by the flooding that began on March 16, 2009, are urged to begin  cleaning up their homes and personal property as soon as possible. Officials from Minnesota’s Homeland  Security Emergency Management (HSEM) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  emphasize that it is not necessary to wait for an inspection before beginning this process.   ""We encourage individuals affected by the disaster to remain cautious and return home only when it is safe to  do so,"" said Federal Coordinating Officer Mike Smith. ""Property owners should document all losses and  damages by taking photos first, or making a list, and then begin immediately removing all flood damaged  personal property.""   Before making permanent repairs to your home-such as drywall, structural components, electrical systems or  plumbing-make sure you get the proper permits from your local community or county permitting officials. This  is especially important for those living in a Special Flood Hazard Area to ensure compliance with local  floodplain management requirements.   ""Our main concern is the health and safety of Minnesotans as they begin the clean-up process,"" said State  Coordinating Officer Kris Eide. ""It is important for homeowners to get accurate information from state and  local officials in order to protect themselves and their loved ones.""   The following precautions are suggestions that residents in flooded areas may want to implement:     Confirm the water supply is safe to drink. Listen for news reports to learn whether the community’s  water supply has been contaminated by the floodwaters. Remember to carry bottled drinking water and  discard any food products that may have come in contact with floodwater.     Wear protective clothing. Protect yourself during cleanup by wearing boots, gloves and masks. Clean     Ventilate your home. Open all doors and windows to allow air to circulate and dry out your home.     Service damaged septic tanks, cesspools, pit and leaching systems as soon as possible. Damaged   and disinfect everything floodwater contacted.   Dehumidify as soon as possible after a flood.   sewage systems are serious health hazards.     Make a list of lost or damaged items. Be sure to include their age and value, and if possible, have   receipts for those items available.     Prevent mold growth. Wash all surface areas in the house that came in contact with floodwater.   Disinfect and wipe surfaces dry with paper towels to minimize bacterial contamination.  Isolate any moldy objects. Seal moldy trash in plastic bags and remove them immediately. Objects you  can save should be dried or frozen as soon as possible. Freezing inactivates mold.      For more tips on cleaning up and keeping your family safe, visit www.fema.gov/hazard/flood/,  www.minnesotarecovers.org  or the CDC’s flood website at www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/floods/.   FEMA coordinates the Federal government's role in preparing for, preventing, mitigating the effects of,  responding to, and recovering from all domestic disasters, whether natural or man-made, including acts of    safe.

By late January 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,369 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Houston  Avenue, from E. 82nd Street to E. 83rd Place, E. 83rd Place, from S. Commercial Avenue to S. Bond  Avenue and E. 83rd Street, from S. Commercial Avenue to S. Houston Avenue. The old water main  dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  7th Ward Office: 773-731-7777  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,980 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Lawndale Avenue, from  W. Fullerton Avenue to W. Dickens Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1900 and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Colón’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s about the time the old water main was  installed beneath your street.  Among other things:           HAMBURGER      •  Hawaii became a U.S. territory.  •  The hamburger was created by Louis Lassing in Connecticut.  •  Actor Spencer Tracy was born.  •  The U.S. Navy’s first submarine made its debut.  •  The second modern Olympic Games opened in Paris, and lasted for 5 months.  •  L. Frank Baum wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.  •  The first electric bus became operational in New York City.  •  English handwriting experts established the art of calligraphy.                                        LAWNDALE AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,980 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Lawndale Avenue, from W. Fullerton Avenue to W. Dickens Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consist of a 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1900 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late July 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Lawndale Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   ALDERMAN REY COLÓN   773- 365-3535   312-742-1021                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July 2013.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:   (cid:153) A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.    (cid:153) Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,    (cid:131)  (cid:131)  water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)  (cid:131)  outdoor water conservation kit or  (cid:131)  (cid:131)  And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:   (cid:153)  Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.  (cid:153)  Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.  (cid:153)  Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.  (cid:153)  Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.  (cid:153)  If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.  (cid:153)  Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.  (cid:153)  Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.  (cid:153)  Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.    (cid:153)     WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Sedgwick, Suite 400, Chicago, IL 60654      Phone 312/744-4111, Fax 312/744-1081, TTY 312/744-1088   www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations   MILITARY STATUS DISCRIMINATION   FAQ   Chicago has amended its Human Rights and Fair Housing Ordinances to address discrimination targeting  current  and  former  members  of  the  military.    Effective  March  16,  2016,  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  military status will be prohibited in the City of Chicago in all areas under the Commission’s jurisdiction:  employment, public accommodations, credit transactions, bonding and housing.  This protection includes  discrimination  targeting  individuals  on  the  basis  of  his/her  military  discharge  status  and  extends  to  individuals  who  are  on  active  duty,  or  in  any  reserve  component  of  any  branch  of  any  state  or  Federal  armed forces, or a veteran thereof.     1.  What is considered “Military Status?”     A person will be able to claim military status protection if he or she is on active duty or in the reserves of  any branch of any state or federal armed forces.  This protection also extends to veterans of any of these  branches.  Lastly, any person who has been a target of discrimination based on his/her military discharge  status can also claim protection under this category.     2.  Do  the  new  protections  require  employers  to  give  preference  to  applicants  based  on  their   military status?   No,  the  new  protections  do  not  require  employers  to  give  preference  to  applicants  on  the  basis  of  their  military status.  However, employers who  have adopted a veteran’s preference hiring policy  must apply  their policy fairly and consistently.     3.   If an employee has disruptive Post Traumatic Stress Disorder episodes in the workplace, is the  employer required to ignore it?   No.    An  employer  should  treat  any  apparent  manifestation  of  PTSD  like  any  other  potential  disability- related need of an employee and pursue the proper course of action under its reasonable accommodation  policy.   4.   Is an employer required to save the position of a service member employee while the employee  is deployed for training or active duty?   The military status protections recently enacted by the City do not include any reemployment obligations.   However, employers should be aware that there are Federal and State laws which impose reemployment  obligations upon employers as well as the accrual of seniority and benefits during this time.       5.  Under the Fair Housing Ordinance,  are landlords prohibited from refusing to  rent  to service   members who may be deployed during the duration of the lease agreement?   Yes.  Landlords cannot refuse to rent to military service members simply based on a possibility that they  will be deployed during the duration of the lease.  However, if deployment happens during the lease term  and appropriate notice is given to the landlord, the landlord must be willing to terminate the lease without  penalty if the service member cannot arrange for continued rent payments during such deployment.   6.  Are landlords prohibited from refusing to rent to applicants who intend to use their G.I. Bill to   pay for housing?   Yes.    The  G.I.  Bill  constitutes  a  lawful  source  of  income  and  should  be  accepted  as  a  valid  form  of  payment to cover housing expenses.     7.  May a landlord refuse to rent to a military service member if the landlord is from a country   that the United States military has occupied or invaded?   No.  A landlord may not refuse to rent to a military service member based on the fact that the person is a  member of the military, irrespective of any socio/political objection to U.S. military involvement.     8.  Are  former  service  members  still  protected  under  these  new  provisions  if  they  were   dishonorably discharged from the military?    Yes.    The  fact  of  discharge  from  the  military,  whether  honorable  or  not,  does  not  impact  the  anti- discrimination protections.     9.  Are current or former service members required to have served in the military for a specific   length of time in order to have the military status anti-discrimination protections?   There  is  no  requirement  that  someone  serve  a  minimum  amount  of  time  in  the  military  before  being  entitled to military status protections.    10.  Would  the  protections  cover  military  service  members  from  branches  of  service  in  other   states?  What about other countries?   The military status protections under Chicago’s discrimination ordinances extend to any service member  of any branch of the military in any state in the United States, but do not include military personnel from  other countries.   11.  Who is going to enforce the new City law?   The Chicago Commission on Human Relations (CCHR) is charged with enforcing this law.   12.  How can a person file a complaint under this new law?   Within 180 days of the alleged discrimination, individuals claiming discrimination based on this, or any  other recognized, basis may appear in person between the hours of 9 AM and 3 PM at the Commission on  Human Relations (740 N. Sedgwick, 4th floor) to have a neutral staff member assist with the filing of the  complaint.  information,  see  http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cchr/supp_info/file_a_discriminationcomplaint.html.      Alternatively,  complaints  may  be  mailed   in.     For  more   13.  What are the penalties for violating the new City law?   Any person or entity who violates any of the provisions of the new law may be fined not less than $100  and  not  more  than  $1,000  for  each  offense.  Additionally,  violations  of  the  law  may  result  in  damages  awarded  to  the  successful  complainant,  payment  of  complainant’s  attorney  fees  and  costs,  injunctive  relief, as well as business license discipline for the respondent in question.

An attorney-at-law, and the employees of an attorney-at-law, who is a tax preparer; 2.	A certified public accountant, and the employees of a certified public accountant, who is a tax preparer; 3.  An  officer  or  employee  of  a  federal,  state,  or  local  governmental  agency  who  provides  tax  preparation services in the scope of his employment; or 4.	 An  administrator,  conservator,  guardian,  executor,  trustee,  receiver  or  other  representative  appointed by the court who provides tax preparation services in the scope of that appointment.  •	 Check	the	Preparer’s	History.	 Check with the Better Business Bureau to see if the preparer has a   questionable history and how they are rated.   •	 Make	Sure	the	Preparer	is	Available.	 Make sure you will be able to contact the tax preparer after  you file your return, even after the April 15 due date. This may be helpful in the event questions  arise about your tax return.   •	 Avoid	Large	Refund	Claims.	 Be wary of any preparers who claim they can obtain larger refunds   than other preparers.   •	 Check	the	Preparer’s	Qualifications.	All paid tax return preparers are required to have a Preparer   Tax Identification Number from the IRS.  •	 Know	Your	Rights.	Avoid preparers who don’t provide you with an estimate of the cost of services  and a Consumer Bill of Rights before you use their services. A copy of the Consumer Bill of Rights  can be found in English and Spanish at www.cityofchicago.org/BACP.  •	 Find	a	Free	Tax	Preparer.		The City of Chicago has partnered with the Center for Economic Progress and  Ladder Up to support eligible families and individuals who cannot afford professional tax preparation  services. Visit www.taxprepchicago.org to find the nearest free tax preparation site.  Report	abusive tax preparers to Business	Affairs	and	Consumer	Protection	  by calling	311 or visiting	www.cityofchicago.org/BACP.   @ChicagoBACPCityofChicago.org/BACPDepartment of Business Affairs and Consumer ProtectionCity Hall, 121 North LaSalle Street, Room 805, Chicago, IL 60602Be careful when selecting a licensed tax preparation business to prepare your tax return.

The Commission is responsi- ble for recommending to the City Council which individual buildings, sites, objects, or districts  should be designated as Chicago Landmarks, which protects them by law.   The landmark designation process begins with a staff study and a preliminary summary of  information related to the potential designation criteria. The next step is a preliminary vote by the  landmarks commission as to whether the proposed landmark is worthy of consideration. This vote  not only initiates the formal designation process, but it places the review of city permits for the  property under the jurisdiction of the Commission until a final landmark recommendation is act- ed on by the City Council.   This Landmark Designation Report is subject to possible revision and amendment during  the designation process. Only language contained within a designation ordinance adopted by the  City Council should be regarded as final.   2                      1905 (ORIGINAL TWO-STORY BUILDING)  1914 (TOP THREE STORIES)  NIMMONS AND FELLOWS (1905)  GEORGE C.

District is comprised of four buildings and a park with pergola constructed from 1905  to 1907 by the Sears, Roebuck and Co. for its long-time headquarters campus.  This ensemble ex- emplifies the historic importance of Sears as one of Chicago's most important companies and  America's leading retailer for much of the twentieth century.    1906  NIMMONS AND FELLOWS   1906  NIMMONS AND FELLOWS   1907  NIMMONS AND FELLOWS   3       Sears, Roebuck and Co. grew rapidly from its founding in 1894 to become the nation's largest pur- veyor of goods to small-town and rural America.  Chicago’s excellent transportation infrastructure  and manufacturing base made the city an ideal location for mail-order merchants, of which Sears  was the largest.  In the 1920s the company augmented its catalog business with retail stores to cater  to an increasingly mobile and urban population. By the 1960s, Sears was the largest retailer in the  world and was the first to achieve $1 billion in monthly sales.     The district is closely associated with the careers of three important Sears, Roebuck and Co. execu- tives who are regarded as important figures in the history of American business.  Richard W. Sears,   the company's founder and first president, originated the Sears mail-order catalog, an iconic symbol  of American merchandising, and through the catalog, Sears cemented the company’s long-standing  relationship with rural and small-town customers.  Julius Rosenwald, who succeeded Sears as com- pany president, was the driving force behind the construction of the Sears headquarters campus in  North Lawndale.  Rosenwald managed the company's expansion during the early 20th century,  while becoming a leading philanthropist, supporting the University of Chicago, Adler Planetarium  and a variety of African-American causes throughout the United States.  Robert Wood, Sears’ third  president, guided the company’s embrace of “bricks-and-mortar” retail stores, which allowed Sears  to maintain its leading position as a national merchant in the post-World War II era.    In addition to its historic significance, the Sears, Roebuck and Co. District is a fine ensemble of his- toric commercial and industrial architecture, as well as landscape design.  Though the buildings  each served different purposes, they were designed to be visually cohesive and to be a statement of  Sears’ outstanding role in American business.  The buildings and pergola of the district were de- signed by the nationally-significant architectural firm of Nimmons and Fellows, with later additions  to the Administration and MDL buildings being the work of George C. Nimmons.  Nimmons was  an early twentieth-century expert in industrial architectural design and a master in combining the  Chicago School principle of a clearly- and rationally-expressed structure with Classical- and Prairie -style ornament.     The historic and architectural significance of the Sears, Roebuck and Co. headquarters and mail  order plant was first recognized in 1978 when the complex was designated by the federal govern- ment as a National Historic Landmark (NHL), one of only 2500 historic places in the US which  “possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United  States.” Despite this recognition, the catalog operation of Sears was becoming unprofitable.  Opera- tions at the mail order plant were scaled back and they were completely halted in 1987.  In 1993 the  unprofitable catalog operation and underperforming stores were closed.      Due to the size of the Sears Campus and the impact its closing would have on the City and neigh- borhood, the Sears corporation recruited a development entity in 1993 to plan a reuse for the vacant  buildings and redevelop the campus for the neighborhood.  The complex would be renamed Homan  Square.  As part of this agreement, the Merchandise Building was determined to be unable to be  reused and it was demolished, with the exception of the tower.  The ongoing redevelopment of  Homan Square is discussed on page 26.  Before demolition, the complex was extensively docu- mented by the Historic American Building Survey (HABS), a National Park Service program.  In  2002, the Sears Administration Building was individually designated as a Chicago Landmark.            4      The Sears, Roebuck and Co. District is located on the Far West Side of Chicago in the North  Lawndale community area.  The District consists of four buildings and a park with pergola  situated on eight acres of land centered around the intersection of S. Homan Avenue and W.  Arthington Street.  The aerial photo (top) shows the arrangement of the historic structures  and park on the site.      This map is meant for illustrative purposes only. The final district boundary and description would be defined in a  Chicago landmark designation ordinance passed by City Council.   5        THE HISTORY OF SEARS, ROEBUCK AND CO.    Throughout much of the twentieth century, Sears, Roebuck and Co. was a national leader in the  merchandising industry, first as a premiere mail-order company, then later adding retail stores.   In the early-20th century, Sears’ products transformed the material cultural of households,  farms and workshops in rural areas and small towns across the country through the wide-spread  American embrace of the Sears mail-order catalog.  As America became more urban and mo- bile in the 1920s, Sears’ expanded its mail-order business with a nationwide chain of retail  stores that helped it maintain its position as one of America’s leading merchandise companies  in the post-World War II era.      Sears’ immense processing, manufacturing, printing, shipping and warehousing activities made  a significant contribution to Chicago’s economic development for much of the 20th century.   The city was ideally located to bring rural consumers and urban manufacturers together through  the catalogs which offered a glimpse of city life and direct access to products with no ""middle  man.""  In his book Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West (1991), environmental  historian William Cronon described the Chicago mail-order business model:     Henceforth, it needn't really matter whether one lived in city or country, for the good  life could be purchased by mail wherever one made one's home. The advent of the  post office's rural free delivery in 1896 was an immediate consequence of the public  demand that Ward and Sears had helped create, and it pointed the way to the roads,  telephones, electrical networks, and chain stores that would transform the rural land- scape of America in the twentieth century.     It would also, as Cronon points out, provide a conduit for transmitting the wealth of the rural  areas back to the city.  This transfer of wealth from country to city was not unwelcome to rural  Americans as farm families benefitted from lower prices on mail-order goods compared to pric- es at local small-town retail prices.  In the late-19th century, these households sold their crops  for cash and bought goods from local stores where the price of retail goods was often 100 per- cent more than wholesale costs of the same products in cities where they were manufactured.   Organizations of farmers such as “the Grange” protested inflated prices offered by local  “middlemen.”  Mail-order companies such as Sears were able to offer goods at lower costs by  elimination such middleman, by leveraging expanding rail networks to distribute goods and by  taking advantage of the then-new free rural delivery offered by the post office (another service  advocated by the Grange) to reach rural customers.      The company’s establishment by Richard Sears and the creation of the Sears catalog  Though Sears, Roebuck & Co. achieved its most lasting importance as a Chicago company, it  traces its origins to Minnesota.  There in the small town of North Redwood, Richard Warren  Sears (1863-1914) worked as a telegrapher and station agent for the Minneapolis and St. Louis  Railroad.  In addition to his employment with the railroad, Sears dabbled in selling goods to the  townspeople of North Redwood.  In 1886 he bought a shipment of wholesale Chicago-made  watches and resold them at a modest profit.  Watches at this time, particularly in rural America,  were becoming more of a necessity than a luxury as daily life became more regulated by train  schedules.     6     for the first 80 of what would become 300 new units of housing, a new community center, YMCA,  grade schools and high schools. The Homan Square redevelopment has gained national recognition  as a model of urban revitalization.    The redevelopment plans continue under the Foundation for Homan Square, a not-for-profit organi- zation.  In 2009 the Foundation spearheaded the restoration and adaptation of the 1905 Power  House into a modern public charter high school, a project which has won numerous awards in the  areas of historic preservation, energy efficiency and education.      MAIL-ORDER COMPANIES IN CHICAGO    By the turn of the twentieth century, Chicago was the major center for mail-order retailers in the  United States.  “Mail-order houses,” as these retailers were commonly known, were a distinctly  American retailing innovation that developed in response to the needs of a primarily rural citizenry  spread over a vast area.  In comparison to mail order offerings, country stores offered small inven- tories of overpriced products.      The heyday of the mail-order business occurred between the 1890s and the 1910s, when it was  dominated by Chicago-based companies Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Montgomery Ward. During  this period, these companies became two of the largest business enterprises in the United States.  Chicago’s central location and its network of railroads made the city a logical choice for the mail- order trade.  By the turn of the century, Chicago had emerged as the most important railroad center  in the country, with more lines of track radiating in more directions than any other city.  The system  of railroads connected the city to the Midwest’s agriculture-producing regions which made Chicago  the central point of the grain, livestock, and meat packing industries.  Early mail-order retailers rec- ognized that the system of rail lines that brought grain and livestock into Chicago for processing  could also be used as a distribution system that delivered finished goods cheaply and efficiently to  those same far-flung farming communities.  Moreover, Chicago’s reputation as a major manufac- turing center meant that many of the goods sold by mail order retailers – from candy to furniture –  were made by Chicago companies.       The first large retailer to use catalogs as its primary promotional tool and to sell directly to the rural  consumer was Chicago-based Montgomery Ward.  Aaron Montgomery Ward, a New Jersey native,  came to Chicago in 1866 and went to work for large dry-goods business of Field, Palmer, & Leiter  (which would later become Marshall Field & Co.).  There Ward worked as a field representative  selling products in rural areas.  In 1872 Ward struck out on his own with an innovative mail-order  business that marketed and sold items directly to rural consumers.  .     Ward’s first catalog in August 1872 was a single-sheet price list of 163 items; in a mere two years  the catalog had grown to over 100 pages with over 25,000 items ranging from clothing to steam  engines.  In 1875, the company instituted an unprecedented policy that promised “satisfaction guar- anteed or your money back.”  By the early 1900s, Wards employed over 7,000 men and women in  Chicago and was selling tens of millions of dollars in goods annually. The Montgomery Ward &  Co. Catalog House at 600-618 W. Chicago Avenue (1907-1908) is a designated Chicago Land- mark, while the Montgomery Ward Building at 6 N. Michigan Avenue, designed by Richard E.  Schmidt and begun in 1899, is located within the Historic Michigan Boulevard Chicago Landmark  District.     19   "

I want to  be certain you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to  call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,356 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Clifton  Avenue, from W. Webster Avenue to W. Armitage Avenue. The old main dates  back to 1885 and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Waguespack’s office, and he has made clear  we are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas H. Powers, P.E.   Commissioner       cc: Alderman Scott Waguespack        32nd Ward            Do you wonder what was happening in 1885?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.

Webster Avenue to W. Armitage Avenue.            Reason: The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1885, and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Work starts shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in late June (restoration  will follow in late July). This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected  developments in the street, or other circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our  schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Clifton Avenue without interruption, but we will  have to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June.  Restoration will follow in late July. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are  at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016      Good morning Chairman Austin, Vice Chairman Ervin, members of the Committee on Budget  and Government Operations and members of the City Council. I would like to thank you for the  opportunity  to  present  to  you  the  2017  Budget  proposal  for  the  Department  of  Water  Management (DWM).       Our  mission  is  to  ensure  the  health  of  the  public  in  the  most  environmentally  and  fiscally  responsible  manner  by delivering  a  sufficient  supply  of quality  water  and  efficiently  managing  waste and stormwater.       Through our operations at the Jardine and Sawyer Water Purification Plants – the two largest  conventional  treatment  plants  in  the  world  –  DWM  purifies,  on  average,  about  800  million  gallons of water a day.  We also operate 12 pumping stations that distribute water through more  than  4,400  miles  of  water  mains.    On  the  sewer  side,  the  department  is  responsible  for  transmission of wastewater through more than 4,400 miles of sewer mains to the Metropolitan  Water Reclamation District.        We  provide  purified  water  to  more  than  2.7  million  customers  in  Chicago  and  2.67  million  customers in 125 surrounding suburbs.  On a daily basis, more than 5.3 million customers, or 42  percent of the Illinois population, depend on our infrastructure for clean, safe drinking water.        Since my confirmation in May, we have continued to meet our goals of Mayor Emanuel’s 10- year  capital  program,  now  almost  at  the  halfway  mark.    In  June,  we  hosted  ACE16  -  the  American  Water  Works  Association’s  Annual  Conference  and  Exposition  -  where  more  than  14,000 water professionals gathered to learn from one another.  At the conference I explained  why every time they went from point A to point B, whether to dinner, the airport or sightseeing,  their route might be slowed due to our construction.  We have been in every ward over the last  five  years  either  replacing  water  mains  or  sewer  mains  or  lining  structures  and  sewers.  Our  crews are hard at work to upgrade our aging infrastructure to ensure we won't have to be back  again for decades. Further, every dollar spent improving our infrastructure puts people to work,  which is a tangible benefit to our residents and our communities.        Today,  we  continue to  actively  move  closer  to  reaching  our goals  established  in  2011,  which  include:    •  Replacing 880 miles of water mains;  •  Replacing 250 miles of sewer mains;   Page -1-      Department of Water Management    2017 Budget Hearing   Remarks of Barrett B. Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016   •  Lining  more  than  470  miles  of  sewers  and  140,000  sewer  structures  to  extend  their   useful life; and   •  Converting three pumping stations from steam to electric power.      I could not be prouder of the men and women who work for the Department, helping each day to  make  our  plans  a  reality.  In  the  last  four  years  we  have  hired  or  promoted  more  than  700  employees.  Throughout  training  and  professional  development to ensure the safe and efficient execution of the capital plan.    the  Department,  we  ensure  proper      The  ability  to  provide  quality,  cost-effective  and  reliable  services  requires  a  multi-faceted  administrative effort.  That includes: incorporating facility assessments; working with the various  labor unions to achieve work rule compliance; executing competitive contracts; coordinating with  other agencies, utilities and departments; and implementing traditional and alternative funding to  avoid overburdening future generations.       We  constantly  coordinate  with  other  departments,  with  your  ward  staff,  utilities  and  other  agencies  to  identify  opportunities  for  collaboration.  The  use  of  the  latest  mapping  and  scheduling  technology,  as  well  as  monthly  coordination  meetings  between  departments  and  utilities, has contributed to an accelerated and more efficient and cost-effective program.        Earlier  this  year,  the  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  highlighted  our  Department  as  a  success story, saying that, ""In 2014, investments by … the CDWM generated nearly 20,000  total  jobs,  including  more  than  10,000  direct  construction,  water,  and  sewage  jobs…  increased regional economic output by almost $2 billion over the year.”       Infrastructure  investments  are  a  win-win  for  Chicago  and  Illinois.  The  investments  improve  environmental  quality  for  households  and  businesses;  provide  middle-class  employment  for  construction workers & the employees of water facilities; preserves our most precious resource;  and ripples into other sectors of the economy.      We  continue  to  improve  operations  and  maintenance,  which  includes  addressing  emergency  repairs and other calls for service. Work orders are being completed and closed more quickly,  resulting in a decreased backlog. In the areas of leaks and breaks, no water, water in basement,  catch basin repair requests and sewer cave-ins, our response times are down as well, as are  the number of open service requests. This increased productivity is due to the hard work of our  men and women in the field, the reduction in water main breaks and collapsed sewers due to  capital work, and by holding crews accountable to do their work efficiently and safely.    Page -2-      Department of Water Management    2017 Budget Hearing   Remarks of Barrett B. Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016      The  MeterSave  Program  is  an  important  program  that  saves  water,  and  at  the  same  time,  it  saves our customers money. This year, we will exceed our installation goal of 15,000 meters.  The only way to know exactly how much water someone is using is to measure it.  With more  awareness of water use, we will all become better stewards of this great natural resource. Word  of mouth is our best marketing tool and we truly appreciate you and your staff’s assistance in  this effort as we continue to promote installation of water meters for all properties.      In 2017, our administrative goals remain the same: reform and improve where we can; cut, or  amend our approach where we must; and invest where it matters. Our construction targets for  2017 will include:   •  90 miles of water main installation  •  15,000 MeterSave meter installations  •  29 miles of sewer main installation  •  52 miles of sewer main lining  •  14,000 structure linings      At the end of our 10-year program, DWM will have invested nearly $7 billion in the improvement  of our water and sewer systems.  As Commissioner of the Department of Water Management, I  pledge to continue to work with each of you as we look at the service needs in your wards to  make the improvements necessary to maintain and improve quality of life. I am committed to  remaining  accessible  and  improving  communications  between  our  Department  and  you  and  your staff.       We  have  accomplished  much  in  2016,  and  I  look  forward  to  continuing  to  deliver  the  best  possible services to the residents of Chicago next year. Together, we will ensure that Chicago’s  water and sewer system provides high-quality service to all of our customers.       Thank you.         Page -3-      "

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you,  our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our private contractor will soon be installing a new sewer in:     N. Menard Avenue, from N. Milwaukee Avenue to N. Magnet Avenue    N. Menard Avenue, from N. Manila Avenue to N. Northwest Highway    N. Magnet Avenue, from N. Menard Avenue to approx. 485’ south of N. Manila Avenue    N. Manila Avenue, from N. Magnet Avenue to N. Menard Avenue    W. Catalpa Avenue, from N. Menard Avenue to N. Mason Avenue      The old pipe dates back to 1902, and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Arena’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner              cc:  Ald.

That’s the year the old sewer main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:         Richard J. Daley        Animal Crackers were introduced to the American public.    Theodore Roosevelt became the first American President to ride in an automobile.    The first college football bowl game, the Rose Bowl between Michigan and Stanford,   was held in Pasadena, California.               JC Penney opened its first store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming.    The Texas Oil Company, Texaco, was formed.    Denmark became the first country to adopt fingerprinting as a way to identify criminals.    Richard J. Daley was born; he served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in   1976.                    PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management’s private contractor will soon be installing a  new sewer in:      N. Menard Avenue, from N. Milwaukee Avenue to N. Magnet Avenue    N. Menard Avenue, from N. Manila Avenue to N. Northwest Highway    N. Magnet Avenue, from N. Menard Avenue to approx. 485’ south of N. Manila Avenue    N. Manila Avenue, from N. Magnet Avenue to N. Menard Avenue    W. Catalpa Avenue, from N. Menard Avenue to N. Mason Avenue      Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1902 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by  Milwaukee on the north and east, Northwest Highway on the south, and Mason on the west will  benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work begins shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in mid-November.  Restoration of the damaged streets/parkways will follow. If the weather permits, we expect full  restoration to occur in late November. Otherwise, a concrete base will be placed at the time and  the streets will be paved with asphalt in May 2013. Dates may change depending on weather and  other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:   When we are working in the street, we will have closures to “through traffic”. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Safety is our first consideration.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.           CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE             ALDERMAN JOHN ARENA   773-286-4545   3-1-1            312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Arena, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.             Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

By late March 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and NPL Construction Company  crews will begin the work to install 2,611 feet of new 8-inch water main in N. Bell Avenue, from   W. Jarvis Avenue to W. Touhy Avenue, N. Hamilton Avenue, from 200 feet north of W. Chase  Avenue to W. Touhy Avenue and N. Oakley Avenue, from W. Chase Avenue to W. Touhy Avenue.   The old water main dates back to 1908, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  49th Ward Office: 773-338-5796  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    •  When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

On July 26, 2010, you sent us an email, dated June 20, 2010, from the  [sponsor].  The [Sponsor] has invited you, on behalf of the [Co-sponsor I]  “CS1”)  and  the  [Co-sponsor  II](“CS2”),  to  attend  the  [Conference],  which will be held in [Foreign City], September 29th to October 1, 2010.   According  to  the  materials  you  sent  us,  other  [members  of  your  profession]  have  been  extended  the  same  invitation.    Your  expenses,  including  round-trip  Chicago-[Foreign  City]  coach  airfare,  four  nights  accommodation,  show  registration  and  admission  tickets  to  all  fair  events,  will  be  paid  jointly  by  CS1and  CS2.    You  have  asked  staff  whether  the  City’s  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  prohibits  you  from  accepting this offer.    [Conference],  which  is  held  annually,  is  the  world’s  largest  [profession  specific  conference],  drawing  representatives  of  over  800  [related  professionals] worldwide.  In fact, this is the 9th consecutive [Conference]  to which you or other [CD] personnel have been invited, and that we  have  addressed.  At  [Conference],  you  will  have  the  opportunity  to  improve  your  knowledge  of  and  leading  [professionals] in the [content area] world, as well as sharing ideas and  experiences  with  fellow  [members  of  your  profession].    You  told  staff  that  your  attendance  at  [Conference]  would  benefit  the  City  and  enhance  your  ability  to  perform  your  City  duties,  and  that  you  have  already received approval for attendance from the [CD] Commissioner  and your immediate [CD] supervisors.    In  addition  to  this,  this  year  [Co-Sponsor  III  (“CS3)]  is  giving  its  third  [member of the profession] of the Year Award, which will be bestowed  upon  an  American  [member  of  the  profession]  responsible  for  a  [materials]  in  his  or  her  [workplace],  and  whose  work  has  been  noticeable during the year.  You will be able to vote for your candidate  by sending the Commission an email with the name of the [member of  the profession] of your choice and if you so wish, the reason why you   familiarity  with   the   of   on      profession]   in   the   [Conference],   are  recommending  that  person.  The  deadline  for  casting  votes  is  September 15th, 2010.  From all recommendations, five finalists will be  selected, and the winner will announced during the presentation of the   [members  the  morning of September 29th. The award will consist of $2,500 and a check will be given  to the winner at that time.  This year, the hosts will be publishing the second volume of  the  [Professional  publication],  and  they  sent  you  a  form  to  fill  out  with  at  least  one   recommendation,  to  be  included  in  the  guide,  which  will  be  presented  during  [Conference].     Under § 2-156-040(d) of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance, City employees are  not  prohibited  from  accepting  hosting  expenses,  including  travel,  meals  and  entertainment,  if:  (1)  the  expenses  are  reasonable;  (2)  the  expenses  are  furnished  in  connection  with  public  events,  appearances  or  ceremonies  related  to  official  City  business; (3) the expenses are furnished by the sponsor of the public event; and (4) the  offer is not based upon any mutual understanding that the official decisions or actions  of any City employee concerning the business of the City would be influenced.    Based on our review of the written invitation materials you sent us, staff concludes that  all  the  conditions  listed  in  §  -040(d)  of  the  Ordinance  are  met,  and  thus  that  the  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  you  from  accepting  these  travel  and  hosting  expenses.   Our  conclusion  is  consistent  with  advice  we  have  given  to  you  and  other  similarly  situated  employees  in  the  past.  (See  Case  Nos.  09035.Q,  08042.A,  07036.Q,  06041.Q,  05049.Q, 04038.Q, 03039Q.and 02029.Q). As you noted in your email (and as we have  advised  you  in  past  years),  you  will,  as  a  matter  of  policy,  seek  the  approval  of  the  Mayor’s Chief of Staff for this trip, seeing that it is for overseas travel.  Further, based on  our review of the written invitation materials you sent us, there would be no prohibition  on  accepting  the  award  if  a  Chicago  [member  of  your  profession]  won  the  [professional] Award described above.      Staff’s conclusion does not necessarily dispose of all issues relevant to this situation, and  is based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the  facts stated in this letter.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify us  immediately,  as  any  change  may  alter  our  conclusion.    Other  laws  or  rules  also  may  apply to this situation.  Be advised that City departments have the authority to adopt  and enforce rules of conduct that may be more restrictive than the limitations imposed  by the Ordinance.    We appreciate your inquiry and your concern to abide by the standards embodied in  the Ordinance.  If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.    Very truly yours,      Steven I. Berlin  Executive Director         Case No. 10038.Q  July 27, 2010  Page 3

Watercraft means any boat, vessel, or other craft used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.  Who is responsible for payment of the tax?  The individual being charged a mooring or docking fee is responsible for payment of the tax to the marina or docking facility.   Who is responsible for collection of the tax?  Effective January 1st, 2006, all Chicago mooring and docking facilities are responsible for collecting and remitting the tax to the Department.  The tax must be collected at the time the fee is collected.  Is there a commission granted for collecting and remitting the tax?  Yes, the collector is allowed a commission of 1% of the tax collected and timely remitted to the Department.  To be considered timely, the remittance and return must be physically received or received in an envelope postmarked by the Unites States Postal Service on or before the due date.  Per chapter 3-4 of the Municipal Code, late payments incur interest at a rate of 12% per annum simple interest, calculated daily, based on a 365 day calendar year and a late penalty rate of 5% of the tax due.  How often is the Boat Mooring Tax  remitted and when are returns due?  The tax is to be remitted monthly with taxes collected in one month payable by the last day of the subsequent month.  The tax return for periods commencing on July 1st of each year and ending on June 30 of the subsequent year, is filed annually and is due by August 15th of each year.  Questions?

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,492 feet of 8-inch water main in W. George Street, from N.  Avers Avenue to N. Ridgeway Avenue, N. Ridgeway Avenue, from W. George Street to W.  Diversey Avenue, and N. Lawndale Avenue, from N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Milwaukee Avenue.  The old pipe dates back to 1902, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Reboyras’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:             Animal Crackers were introduced to the American public.    Theodore Roosevelt became the first American President to ride in an automobile.    The first college football bowl game, the Rose Bowl between Michigan and Stanford,   was held in Pasadena, California.     JC Penney opened its first store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming.    The Texas Oil Company, Texaco, was formed.    Denmark became the first country to adopt fingerprinting as a way to identify criminals.    Richard J. Daley was born; he served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in   1976.        RICHARD J. DALEY                          GEORGE ST., RIDGEWAY AVE. & LAWNDALE AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,492 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. George Street, from N. Avers Avenue to N. Ridgeway Avenue, N. Ridgeway  Avenue, from W. George Street to W. Diversey Avenue, and N. Lawndale Avenue, from N.  Hamlin Avenue to N. Milwaukee Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1902 and needs to be replaced.     Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late June 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. George Street, N. Ridgeway Avenue, and N.  Lawndale Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to  close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business,  even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open  for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN ARIEL REBOYRAS   773-794-3095   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June 2014.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

DCASE’s Cultural Grants Program  strives for an equitable distribution of artistic services across the city’s Wards.

In September, Department of Water Management crews will begin work to install a new  sewer main in N. Parkside Avenue (Diversey-George) and in W. George Street (Linder- Luna). The old sewer dates back to 1927 and needs to be replaced.     During construction, our project will require a full continuous closure of Diversey at  Parkside for about one week. Detour routes will be posted in advance. Otherwise, when we  are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always  be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                                                                                114TH STREET WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 551 feet of 8-inch water  main in E. 114th Street, from S. Cottage Grove Avenue to the Alley East of S. Langley Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by mid July 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on E. 114th Street outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid July 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.

Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Starting in early April, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will  install 1,400 feet of 24-inch, 30-inch, and 36-inch new sewer main in S. Langley Avenue  (40th Street-Oakwood Boulevard), and in E. Oakwood Boulevard (Langley Avenue- Vincennes Avenue). The old sewer dates back to 1889 and needs to be replaced.     For a period of time, eastbound traffic on Oakwood Boulevard will be closed at S. Vincennes  Avenue. Vehicular traffic will be detoured from Vincennes north to Pershing, east to  Cottage Grove, and back to Oakwood Boulevard. Our contractor will provide and maintain  access for local and emergency vehicles during the construction period. Otherwise, when   working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business. Outside of working hours, a travel lane will  be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    3rd Ward Office: 773-373-9273    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,637 feet of 8-inch water main in W. 73rd Street, from S.  Kedzie Avenue to S. California Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1909, and needs to be  replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Lane’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:               ERROL FLYNN        The first U.S. university school of nursing was established, at the University of   Minnesota.     Joan of Arc was declared a saint.    The first Lincoln head pennies were minted.    The Indianapolis 500 race track opened.    Actor Errol Flynn was born.    Workers began pouring concrete for the Panama Canal.    The first subway car with side doors went into service in New York City.                           WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,637 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. 73rd Street, from S. Kedzie Avenue to S. California Avenue.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in July. Final restoration will follow in August. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in July. Final  restoration will follow in August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at  the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade.

One Stop Mart, Inc.     Shantanna M. Griffith, President   Applicant (Packaged Goods)    for the premises located at     6360 South Kedzie Avenue      v.               Department of Business Affairs & Licensing   Local Liquor Control Commission       Scott V. Bruner, Director                     This matter comes before the License Appeal Commission for a hearing de novo on the   ORDER    denial of the Appellant=s request for a packaged goods license.  It was denied because the store is   located in a moratorium district and because the issuance of this license would cause a   deleterious impact on the community.       With regard to the moratorium issue it was stipulated by the parties that the premises   were and are located in a moratorium area.  The moratorium bars any additional packaged goods   licenses.  In most cases that stipulation would be determinative of the case.  In this case which   the applicant stipulated to the moratorium she went forth with evidence on the argument that the   legal theory of equitable estoppel should bar the Local Liquor Control Commission from   denying the issuance of the license because of the moratorium.    Equitable estoppel is based on the principle that one may not act in a certain matter and                       1   then take an inconsistent position which prejudices another who acted in reliance on the act.  It   arises when one party, by his or her words or conduct, intentionally and through culpable   negligence, reasonably induces another to rely on his or her representations, and as a result of   that reliance, the other changes his or her position to his or her injury.       The use of equitable estoppel against a municipality is not favored and will be allowed   only in extraordinary or compelling circumstances.  Village of Wadsworth v. Kerton 311 Ill. 3d   829, 726 N.E. 2d 150.  To involve equitable estoppel against a municipality there must be an   affirmative act on the part of the municipality such as a legislative enactment rather than the   authorized acts of misinterpretation or ministerial misinterpretation.  A municipality cannot be   estopped by an act of its agent beyond the authority expressly conferred on that official Hamwi   v. Zollar 299 Ill. App. 3d 1008, 702 N.E. 2d 593.  Representations of an attorney are insufficient   to bind a municipality under equitable estoppel. 264 Ill. App. 3d 887, 637 N.E. 2d 110.       The issue to be addressed first is whether the actions of then Alderman Thomas or the   actions of the employees of the Department of Business Affairs & Licensing were such that they   would estop the City of Chicago from denying the license.  The answer is no as to both.    Shantanna M. Griffith, the owner of the corporate applicant, testified she was aware that a   moratorium was in effect prior to starting the application process.  When she started the process   in October 2006, that an agent of the Department of Business Affairs & Licensing told her to get   the support of the alderman.  Theodore Thomas was the Alderman and he originally opposed the   application.  After he met with community groups he withdrew his opposition and on march 19,                       2   2007, he wrote a letter to Scott Bruner, Director of the Department of Business Affairs and   Licensing, memorializing his support and withdrawing his objection to SLW One Stop mart,   Inc., obtaining a liquor license.  What Alderman Thomas did not do was to take any of the steps   needed to lift the moratorium.  Alderman Thomas was defeated in his bid for re-election in April   2007, and Alderman Foulkes testified she is opposed to lifting the moratorium on liquor stores   applicable to this address.  The actions of former Alderman Thomas were insufficient to impose   equitable estoppel against the City.  There were specific procedures that needed to be followed   for the moratorium to be lifted and they were not done.       The actions of the employees of the Department of Business Affairs and Licensing did   not provide a sufficient base on which to impose equitable estoppel.  While Ms. Griffith suggests   that the Department of Business Affairs and Licensing should not have taken the $4,400 in   application fees and should not have processed the application which led to building inspections   that required spending thousands of dollars to bring the building into code, it does not change the   fact that such actions are not sufficient to impose equitable estoppel.  Ms. Griffith knew at all   times that a moratorium was in effect.  While the evidence is conflicting on this point, Ms.   Griffith may also have been advised specifically by Business Affairs and Licensing that the letter   from Alderman Thomas was not sufficient and the moratorium must be lifted prior to the   issuance of the license.  There is evidence that it was Ms. Griffith who made a knowing decision   to file the application with the moratorium still in effect.             While this Commission understands Ms. Griffith=s feelings that the process may have                  3   been unfair to her the evidence presented at this hearing is not sufficient for the principle of   equitable estoppel to be imposed and an order be entered granting the packaged goods license.        Since the moratorium is in effect and according to Alderman Foulkes will remain in   effect it is not necessary to address the issue of whether the City proved by a preponderance of   the evidence that the granting of the packaged goods license would cause a deleterious impact on   the community.    THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED That the said order or action of the Local   Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago be and the same hereby is AFFIRMED.    Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a petition for rehearing may be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order is deemed  to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the Circuit Court, the  petition for rehearing must be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order as  such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

By early December, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin  preliminary construction work at the intersections of Argyle and Natoma, and Argyle and  Rutherford. Following, our in-house crews will install 750 feet of new 12-inch sewer main in N.  Rutherford Avenue (Argyle-350 feet north) and in N. Natoma Avenue (Argyle-350 feet north).  The  old sewer main dates back to 1936, and needs to be replaced. DWM estimates the new sewer main  will be installed, and the street will be concrete capped by spring 2018.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  wwww.BuildingANewChicago.org to register for project notifications.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the project notifications, you will be informed as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always  be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open for  local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved by the start of  the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Parkway Maintenance  Before any project, the Department of Water Management (DWM) takes photographs of the street  and surrounding properties. These photographs help us restore the area to its preconstruction  state. However, DWM does not assume responsibility for damage to privately installed parkway  improvements, including sprinkling systems, fences, flower beds and shrubbery. New sewer  construction is not complete until damaged sidewalks, parkways and streets have been repaired.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    45th  Ward Office: 773-286-4545    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   This project involves replacing sewer structures that may have caused disruptions to your water  service line. We recommend that as a precaution you flush your water service of any sediment, rust  or metals, including any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside hose  spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where the  water comes into the home that is not used for drinking  water. Fully open the cold water tap and let the water run  for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any other cold water  faucets on that floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush any  taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.              If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water .    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.    Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.       Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner           Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

I want to be certain you are well  informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you have any  questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing a new sewer main in S. Indiana Avenue, from E.  Garfield Boulevard to E. 57th Street. The old pipe dates back to 1889 and needs to  be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Cochran’s office, and he has made clear we  are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Willie Cochran        20th Ward                                                      INDIANA SEWER PROJECT   HISTORY        Do you wonder what was happening in 1889?  That’s the year the old sewer was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:     Hull House              Hull House was opened by Miss Jane Addams at 800 S. Halsted, helping hundreds of   Chicago immigrants gain a place of self-respect in society.     The first train load of fruit, oranges, left Los Angeles for the east coast.    Benjamin Harrison won the American presidency despite Grover Cleveland’s larger   share of the popular vote.      The first concrete reinforced bridge was built.    The Chicago Auditorium opened. President Harrison made a visit.    Charlie Chaplin was born.    Bayer introduced aspirin in powder form, in Germany.    The first jukeboxes were placed in bars and arcades.    The Wall Street Journal began publication.    The Oklahoma land rush officially started.         INDIANA SEWER         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will be installing a new sewer main in S.  Indiana Avenue, from E. Garfield Boulevard to E. 57th Street.       Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1889 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by  Garfield Boulevard on the north, 59th Street on the south, Prairie Avenue on the east and  Michigan Avenue on the west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of  flooding.      Timing:  Work will begin shortly, with completion anticipated for late November. This  includes restoration of the damaged streets/parkways. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: Our excavation and the equipment involved all take up space, and safety, of course, is  the foremost consideration.  We may have some closures to “through traffic”. You will always  have access to your property.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1            ALDERMAN WILLIE COCHRAN   773-955-5610            ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         INDIANA SEWER PROJECT    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it  is.  Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of  digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will  pave the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and  curb at least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City  of Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce  the risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are  aware that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Cochran,  and others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.

Ternand, Star   No. 2717, arising out of the investigation of Complaint Register No. 1058279 (“Request for   Review”).     The Chief Administrator recommended that the following allegations against Officer   Ternand be Sustained:   Allegation No. 1: On November 8, 2012, at or about 6727 South Indiana Avenue, Chicago,  Officer Brandon Ternand used an unreasonable and excessive amount of force when he shot  Mr. Dakota Bright.     Allegation No. 2: On November 8, 2012, at or about 6727 South Indiana Avenue, Chicago,  Officer Brandon Ternand used deadly force against Mr. Dakota Bright which was  unprovoked and unwarranted.     The Chief Administrator recommended that Officer Ternand be discharged from the Chicago   Police Department.    The Superintendent objected to the Chief Administrator’s recommendation. The   Superintendent did not concur with the Chief Administrator’s recommended findings or penalty,   stating that based on all the evidence presented in this case, it is clear that Officer Ternand’s   actions were justified.        No. 17 RR 07  Police Officer Brandon R. Ternand  Request for Review and Opinion              According to the Certificate of Meeting and of Service submitted by the Chief   Administrator: (1) the Chief Administrator met with the Superintendent and/or his designees and   discussed this matter on October 17, 2017; and (2) the Request for Review was sent via email to   the Executive Director of the Police Board on October 18, 2017.      The Executive Director of the Police Board prepared and forwarded the Request for   Review file to Steve Flores, the member of the Police Board who was selected on a random   basis, pursuant to Article VI of the Police Board’s Rules of Procedure (“Reviewing Member”).    The Reviewing Member considered the Request for Review pursuant to Section 2-78-130(a)(iii)   of the Municipal Code of Chicago and Article VI of the Police Board’s Rules of Procedure.              OPINION   In the opinion of the Reviewing Member, the objections raised in the response of the   Superintendent of Police are not sufficient to meet the burden of overcoming the Chief   Administrator’s recommendation for discipline. Based on the facts and circumstances of this   matter, an evidentiary hearing before the Police Board is necessary to determine whether Officer   Ternand violated any of the Police Department’s Rules of Conduct.      Therefore, pursuant to Section 2-78-130(a)(iii) of the Municipal Code of Chicago, the   Chief Administrator’s recommendation for discipline of Police Officer Brandon R. Ternand, Star   No. 2717, shall be deemed accepted by the Superintendent of Police.            2   No. 17 RR 07  Police Officer Brandon R.

Click on the  first  search result  and scroll to  bottom of the page to the  button that  says ""Get Started On-Line"". Click on that  button......  and bookmark  the  page (add it to your  favorites).   2.

Most  questions will  be pre-populated with  the answers from  your template.

In late June, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 1,148 feet of  new 8-inch water main in N. Whipple Street (Diversey-Logan Boulevard).  The old water main  dates back to 1891, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    32nd Ward Office: 773-248-1330    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Commissioner of Water Management     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub.

In mid-February, Department of Water Management (DWM) crews will begin work to  install 2,986 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Dante Avenue (E. 76th Street-S. South  Chicago Avenue), in E. 77th Street (S. Dante Avenue-S. Stony Island Avenue), in S. Harper  Avenue (E. 77th Street-S. South Chicago Avenue), and in E. 76th Place (S. Blackstone  Avenue-S. Stony Island Avenue). The old water main dates back to 1893, and needs to be  replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter  your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.      Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:         24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    8th Ward Office: 773-874-3300    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.    After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for several  minutes.  The aerator screens located at the tip of your faucets should be removed prior to  flushing.     This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, or any  particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line as a result of  the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.    Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner

Select a location that receives  enough pedestrian traffic for the time of your event to sustain the number of food trucks you’re seeking to invite.   Also, be aware of Mobile Food Vehicle (MFV) license operational provisions*: •	 MFVs may operate from a legal street parking space, and in designated Food Stands, not to exceed a   2-hour service limit.  •	 MFVs may operate on private property, not to exceed service limits of two hours, as long as the property   meets the applicable Zoning requirements, and the property owner provides written permission.            Also be aware of any insurance requirements that property owners may require from food trucks or event organizers.  •	 No MFV may park or stand within 200 feet of any principal customer entrance to a restaurant which is   located on the street level with the exception of 12 AM – 2AM.  •	 MFVs are not allowed on privately-owned vacant lots, or a lot of a vacant building. •	 Except at designated Food Stands, MFVs are not allowed in the restricted parking area bounded by the   Chicago River, Michigan Avenue and Harrison Street.  •	 Mobile food vending is prohibited in the Medical Center District.  If your proposed food truck fest location does not meet the MFV license operational provisions, please contact the  Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) to find out if your event qualifies under the Special Events  Permit operational provisions (see section on Special Events Permits below).  OBTAIN A SPECIAL EVENTS PERMIT (IF APPLICABLE)  A Special Event Permit may be obtained to host a food truck event. The Department of Cultural Affairs  and Special Events (DCASE) issues Special Event Permits. The Permit Package Application may be found in  DCASE’s Chicago Neighborhood Festivals web page. If the location of your fest falls within 200 feet of an  entrance to restaurant and/or the event will exceed the two hour service limit, you may apply for a Special  Event Permitted and these restrictions do not apply.   Also, please be aware that the licensed food truck participants of your event must complete the Special Event  Food Truck License Application portion of the Special Event Permit Application and pay the appropriate fee  to participate in a food truck fest permitted by DCASE.   INVITE LICENSED FOOD TRUCKS  The second ingredient to ensuring a successful food truck fest is inviting licensed food trucks. Food trucks must have  either a Mobile Food Dispenser (MFD) or Mobile Food Preparer (MFP) License to operate at your event in Chicago.  More information about food truck licensing may be found in BACP’s Mobile Food Vendor Licenses web page.  To search for licensed food trucks, access the City’s Data Portal at data.cityofchicago.org and type Business License  - Current Active in the search field to access Chicago’s dataset of all current business licenses. Set the license  description filter to Mobile Food License. All of Chicago’s currently licensed MFD and MFP’s will appear. A majority of  food trucks are on social media and have websites. Use this list to contact and invite only those who are licensed by  the City of Chicago.  PROMOTE YOUR EVENT  Food trucks and their followers are avid social media users. Create marketing materials and promote the event  early and often on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. Devise a customized, catchy hashtag  (e.g., #ChiFoodTruckFest) to generate a following. Tag food trucks attending your event to promote amongst  their followers and beyond. And always tag @ChicagoBACP - we’re on the look out to support the next local  food truck fest!  QUESTIONS? CONTACT US AT 312-74-GOBIZ  CITY OF CHICAGO • DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND CONSUMER PROTECTION*City Council may from time to time define areas, in the interest of preserving public health and safety or avoiding traffic congestion, in which no mobile food vendor may prepare or dispense food from a wheeled vehicle.  The City Clerk shall maintain for public inspection and copying a file of all ordinances defining such areas.

Background   Snow cover refers to the amount of land covered by snow at any given time. Naturally, it is influenced  by the amount of precipitation that falls as snow. Air temperature also plays a role because it  determines whether precipitation falls as snow or rain, and it affects the rate at which snow on the  ground melts. As temperature and precipitation patterns change, so can the overall area covered by  snow.   Snow cover is not just something that is affected by climate change; it also exerts an influence on  climate. Because snow is white, it absorbs only a small portion of the sunlight that hits it (10 to 20  percent in the case of fresh snow), and it reflects the rest back to space. In contrast, darker surfaces  such as bare ground and open water absorb the majority of the energy they receive and heat up more  quickly. In this way, the overall amount of snow cover affects patterns of heating and cooling over the  Earth’s surface. More snow means more energy reflects back to space, resulting in cooling, while less  snow cover means more energy is absorbed at the Earth’s surface, resulting in warming.   On a more local scale, snow cover is important for many plants and animals. For example, some plants  and animals rely on a protective blanket of snow to insulate them from sub-freezing winter  temperatures. Humans and ecosystems also rely on snowmelt to replenish streams and groundwater.  Snow cover also keeps the soil moist, so if the snow melts away earlier in the spring, the soil may dry out  sooner, which can stress plants and increase the risk of wildfire.1   About the Indicator   This indicator tracks the area covered by snow since 1972, based on maps generated by analyzing  satellite images collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figure 1 was created  by analyzing weekly maps to determine the total extent of snow cover, then averaging the weekly  observations together to get a value for each year. Figure 2 uses the same method, but with average  snow cover calculated for each season: spring (defined as March–May), summer (June–August), fall  (September–November), and winter (December–February). These two figures cover all of North  America, not including Greenland. Figure 3 focuses on the contiguous 48 states plus Alaska. It shows the  average date when snow first starts to cover the ground in the fall, the average last date of snow cover  in the spring, and the length of time between them. These snow cover season dates have been averaged  over all parts of the country that regularly receive snow.    Key Points   •  When averaged over the entire year, snow covered an average of 3.24 million square miles of   North America during the period from 1972 to 2015 (see Figure 1).      1   Climate Change Indicators in the United States: Snow Cover   www.epa.gov/climate-indicators - Updated August 2016     •  The extent of snow cover has varied from year to year. The average area covered by snow has  ranged from 3.0 million to 3.6 million square miles, with the minimum value occurring in 1998  and the maximum in 1978 (see Figure 1).   •  Between 1972 and 2015, the average extent of North American snow cover decreased at a rate  of about 3,300 square miles per year. The average area covered by snow during the most recent  decade (2006–2015) was 3.21 million square miles, which is about 4 percent smaller than the  average extent during the first 10 years of measurement (1972–1981)—a difference of 122,000  square miles, or approximately an area the size of New Mexico (see Figure 1).   •  Decreases in snow cover have largely occurred in spring and summer, whereas fall and winter  snow cover have remained fairly steady over the time period studied (see Figure 2). Spring and  summer snow cover can have a particularly important influence on water supplies.   •  Since 1972, the U.S. snow cover season has become shorter by nearly two weeks, on average   (see Figure 3). By far the largest change has taken place in the spring, with the last day of snow  shifting earlier by 19 days since 1972. In contrast, the first date of snow cover in the fall has  remained relatively unchanged.   2         Climate Change Indicators in the United States: Snow Cover   www.epa.gov/climate-indicators - Updated August 2016       Figure 1.

POLICE BOARD FINDINGS   The Police Board of the City of Chicago, as a result of its consideration of this matter,   finds and determines that:   1.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 1 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston did resist a lawful arrest by Officer Durkin and Officer Alaniz.     See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 2 below, which are incorporated here by   reference.      2.   The allegations, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 2 are supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegations are therefore sustained.

The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 6 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston violated the provisions of General Order 07-01, Section III-C, when he was in  possession of a firearm while he was intoxicated.     One of the residents of the location of the incident, Josephine Johnson, provided a   statement during the investigation of the charges, in which she stated that while Officer Boston      3   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2315  Police Officer Joseph Boston  Findings and Decision    was in the hallway knocking on the door of Unit #303, she saw the holster of Officer Boston’s               gun in his waist.  Furthermore, there were several reports submitted that Officer Boston exhibited   signs of being highly intoxicated, in addition to a Breathalyzer test result of .153, some hours   after the incident that indicate Officer Boston was intoxicated while carrying his weapon in   violation of General Order 07-01, Section III-C.      4.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 9 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston engaged in an unjustified physical altercation by flailing his arms to defeat  the arrest, pulling away after Officer Durkin had one cuff on him, and refusing to place his  legs inside the squad car.     See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 2 above, which are incorporated here by   reference.      5.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 10 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston failed to maintain control of his weapon, in that Police Officer Elizabeth  Alaniz recovered Officer Boston’s weapon from the floor of the 3rd floor hallway of 4280  West Ford City Drive.

The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 15 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0931 hours, while off duty, Officer Boston was  intoxicated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.153. A back extrapolation of Officer  Boston’s Breathalyzer test results revealed that at the time of the incident, on March 9, 2008,  at approximately 0455 hours, Officer Boston’s blood alcohol concentration was between  0.195 and 0.238.  Officer Boston also admitted that on March 9, 2008, he was intoxicated  and was driven home by his brother.     Lieutenant LaVoy reported that on the day in question, he observed Officer Boston, and   Officer Boston’s overall actions led Lieutenant LaVoy to conclude that Officer Boston was   intoxicated.  Lieutenant LaVoy also reported that he ordered Officer Boston to take a   Breathalyzer test, and the results indicated that Officer Boston had a blood-alcohol concentration   of .153 at 9:31 a.m.              There was also a report submitted by Sergeant Michael Murzyn, who responded to the   scene of the incident, following a request from Officers Durkin and Alaniz.  Sergeant Murzyn   reported that he entered the squad car where Officer Boston was being held to talk with Officer   Boston and smelled a very strong odor of alcohol on Officer Boston’s breath, Officer Boston’s   eyes were bloodshot and his speech was slurred.              Reports were obtained from Officers Durkin and Alaniz wherein they reiterated that   Officer Boston appeared to be intoxicated on the day in question.                 7.  The Police Board has considered the facts and circumstances of Officer Boston’s   conduct, and his complimentary and disciplinary histories.  Officer Boston, while off duty, was   intoxicated while possessing his gun, threatened and resisted responding officers, and failed to      5   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2315  Police Officer Joseph Boston  Findings and Decision    maintain control of his weapon.  Officer Boston’s reckless and dangerous actions are serious               offenses, and the thirty-day suspension ordered in this case is not unwarranted.            POLICE BOARD DECISION      The Police Board of the City of Chicago hereby adopts the findings set forth herein by   the following votes:      By votes of 9 in favor (Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William F.  Conlon, Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D.

In May, Department of Water Management crews will begin work to install a new sewer  main in S. Hoyne Avenue (71st Place-72nd Street), in W. 71st Street (Hoyne-300’ west), in W.  71st Place (Hoyne-300’ west), in W. 72nd Street (Hoyne-300’ west), in W. 72nd Place (Hoyne- 300’ west), and in S. Hoyne Avenue (73rd Street-72nd Place). The old sewer dates back to  1900 and needs to be replaced.     This project will require the full continuous closure of 71st Street between Hoyne and  Bell for approximately one week while we replace the existing sewer. Traffic will be  detoured via Damen - 69th Street - Western. Otherwise, when we are working in the street,  we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always be able to reach your home  or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    17th Ward Office: 773-783-3672    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner

By mid May 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,042 feet of new 8-inch and 628 feet of new 12-inch  water main in S. Birkhoff Avenue, from W. 83rd Street to S. Vincennes Avenue, W. 84th Street, from  S. Birkhoff Avenue to S. Vincennes Avenue and W. 83rd Street, from S. Halsted Street to S. Kerfoot  Avenue.  The old water main dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  21st Ward Office: 773-881-9300  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

By early March 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 551 feet of new 8-inch water main in E. Balbo  Avenue, from S. State Street to S. Michigan Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1893, and  needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  4th Ward Office: 773-536-8103  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635        Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.

I want to be certain you are well  informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you have any  questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing a new sewer main in W. Ohio Street, from N.  Central Avenue to N. Parkside Avenue, and in N. Parkside Avenue, from W.  Huron Street to 330’ south of W. Ohio Street. The old pipe dates back to 1902 and  needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Graham’s office, and she has made clear we  are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Deborah Graham        29th Ward                                                   Do you wonder what was happening in 1902? That’s the year the old  sewer main was installed beneath your street. Among other things:                Richard J. Daley             Animal Crackers were introduced to the American public.    Theodore Roosevelt became the first American President to ride in an automobile.    The first college football bowl game, the Rose Bowl between Michigan and Stanford,   was held in Pasadena, California.     JC Penney opened its first store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming.    The Texas Oil Company, Texaco, was formed.    Denmark became the first country to adopt fingerprinting as a way to identify criminals.    Richard J. Daley was born; he served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in   1976.      OHIO/PARKSIDE SEWER        PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will be installing a new sewer main in W.  Ohio Street, from N. Central Avenue to N. Parkside Avenue, and in N. Parkside Avenue, from  W. Huron Street to 330’ south of W. Ohio Street.      Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1902 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by Huron Street on the north, Race Avenue on the south, Central Avenue on the east and the alley west of  Parkside Avenue on the west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work will begin shortly, with completion anticipated for September. Restoration of  the damaged streets/parkways will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other  factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: Our excavation and the equipment involved all take up space, and safety, of course, is  the foremost consideration.  We may have some closures to “through traffic”. You will always  have access to your property.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1            ALDERMAN DEBORAH GRAHAM   773-261-4646            ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         OHIO/PARKSIDE SEWER PROJECT   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it  is.  Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of  digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will  pave the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and  curb at least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City  of Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce  the risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are  aware that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Graham,  and others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.

While IPRA registers all complaints, not all complaints      are investigated by IPRA.  The department    investigates those allegations of misconduct that      concern the use of excessive force, domestic    violence, coercion through a threat of violence, and      biased-based verbal abuse.  IPRA also investigates  all cases in which a CPD member discharges his or      her firearm or Taser stun gun in a manner that    potentially could strike an individual, as well as all        deaths of persons or extraordinary occurrences in    police custody even if no allegations of misconduct is      made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         All other complaints are forwarded to CPD for      investigation.  Cases involving allegations of drug      use, thefts and procedural violations, for example, are    investigated by the Internal Affairs Division of CPD.      Critical Programs/Services to Assist  Residents         Community Meetings    The Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA)      conducts quarterly meetings in various parts of the    City to provide an opportunity to interact with    members of the community and inform residents    of IPRA’s role and function in the police oversight    process. At these meetings IPRA explains its      investigative process, answers questions from      participants, and responds to concerns from members    of the public.       Stakeholders Panel    The Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA)    conducts semi-annual meetings held at IPRA      Headquarters that provide an opportunity for the    community and police organizations, who can affect    or be affected by the police oversight process, to     present issues of concern directly to IPRA personnel.    These “town-hall” style panels provide an opportunity    for a candid dialogue designed to educate IPRA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    117117116                                                                                                                                                                                    investigators about community and police issues and    to inform community and police leaders about IPRA’s    policies and procedures and addresses any questions    and concerns.      Public Reporting    IPRA provides transparency to the disciplinary    process by making public reports on that process and    continuing to use its website as a repository for    information. The website contains Quarterly Reports,    Annual Reports, and a monthly abstract of all      investigations for which IPRA has recommended a       sustained finding against accused CPD members.    The website also provides statistical and    demographic data for every officer-involved shooting    since 2008. IPRA’s website allows citizens to directly    initiate a complaint with IPRA against a CPD member    or to compliment the actions of a CPD member.

Trap counts have decreased. This week 6 trap locations  within the City of Chicago collected WNV positive mosquitoes. These collections contained a combination of  Culex pipiens and Culex restuans mosquitoes.

A review of the evidence presented at the hearing will aid in understanding this   decision.          Thomas O’Donnell has been a building inspector for the City of Chicago for   about eighteen years and is currently a supervising building inspector.  He has been an   inspector in what was formerly known as the Institutions Public Place of Assembly and   Licensing Unit which conducted inspections of public places of assembly.  He conducted   food and liquor licensing inspections.  He has also been an inspector and supervisor in the   strategic task force which is concerned with properties that have criminal activity.           He is familiar with the Green Dolphin at 2200 N. Ashland Avenue which he   described as a large nightclub.  His most recent inspection was June 21, 2011, the date   before the hearing.  He had also done prior inspections at that location.  Those earlier   inspections revealed issues with egress throughout the building.  There was potential   danger in the event of an emergency there was not an adequate number of doors and the   exit doors were not the proper width.  There was not a proper or adequate means of   egress.  The building’s firewall separation exceeded the maximum allowable square   footage which meant sprinklers were needed or the business needed to be   compartmentalized with firewalls.  Inadequate firewall separation would not stop the   spread of fire and smoke.  These inspections also revealed that a number of alterations      2   had been made to the property which affected egress where the exits were located without   permits or plans.  There was a large single story masonry addition added to the northwest   corner of the building.  There was a small outdoor beer garden enclosed without a permit   and a large patio area that had plans and permits but was not built according to plans   submitted to the City.  The rough approximation of the size of these additions would be   25 x 75 for the masonry addition; 30 x 40 for the beer garden and 50 x 75 for the large   patio.  These additions without permits or not being done according to plans are   dangerous because they could affect egress because the previous egress was altered and   improper materials could be used that were not flame retardant.          O’Donnell met with the owner, the owner’s son, a new architect, and an electrical   contractor at the inspection that took place the day before the hearing.  They received a   new set of plans and a demolition permit to remove a wood-framed garage, a wood deck,   and some stairs on the river bank which they did.          Most of the violations O’Donnell was concerned with had been corrected.  A   number of those things were included on the new set of plans.  There had been some   small or minor interior improvements but the more serious things have not been   corrected.  The first inspection on the ongoing building court case was in May of 2010.    O’Donnell has never recommended to the judge to increase occupancy at this location   and the building department has not recommended increased occupancy.  He would like   to see the business obtain new occupancy cards based on an approved new set plans.  The   new plans he observed at the inspection had not been approved by buildings department.       3   Those plans needed to be approved by zoning review before the submittal process at the   Department of Buildings begins.  2200 North Ashland Avenue is not in full compliance   with the buildings department at this time.          O’Donnell testified he was working off an amended complaint at this inspection.    That complaint alleged 51 or 53 violations.  From his perspective only a couple of minor   smaller improvements and changes have been addressed.  The electrical and plumbing   counts on the complaint are not in his area.  O’Donnell did not know if 48 of the 51   violations had been completed.  Over the City’s objection, Respondent’s Exhibit 1, the   First Amended Complaint for Equitable and Other Relief, was allowed in evidence.          O’Donnell agreed that various allegations in the First Amended Complaint dealt   with specific areas in the Jazz Room, the Dolphin Room (that is the West and East   Room) that have been corrected since the initial complaint.  He also agreed additional   doors were installed that solved some of the egress problems but they were installed   without a permit.  O’Donnell referred to Count 36, subparagraph 3, which asked that the   licensee “rework east exit door at Webster Street entrance vestibule so it does not drag on   the sidewalk.”  That was not done as of the inspection the day before the hearing.    Paragraph 6, asking the licensee to remove a coiled overhead shutter in the west room   also had not been done at the time of this last inspection.  While O’Donnell admitted he   had never been at the premise at night, he opined this is a primary entrance point for the   licensee’s business.  He also opined this was a relatively simple item to correct.  As to the   coiled overhead shutter door, O’Donnell explained that work could not be done in      4   minutes but could be done during hours the business is not open.  The licensee would   need plans and permit for this work and this work is included on the new plans that will   be submitted.          O’Donnell testified that he believed Judge Pileggi, by court order, had closed the   area of the tent beer garden and the outside beer garden pending new plans and a new   permit being issued.  He further stated he has been at some of the status hearings on the   building court case but not all the status hearings.  He agreed there has been some   compliance but has not seen significant compliance with the items he identified as   potentially dangerous.  There has been some compliance with regards to egress but not   with respect to the firewall.  The permits needed to do the firewall work have not been   issued.  There is a count in the amended complaint with respect to the fact that the second   egree from the second floor office was removed when one of the additions was done.    This would raise the same concern with regard to people leaving the establishment.    O’Donnell never recommended that Judge Pileggi increase occupancy and he has   concerns about occupancy relating to the danger this building presented to the public.          Patrick Haran has been a plumbing inspector for the City of Chicago for nine   years.  He inspects plumbing systems to verify it is up to code, verify it has proper water   service, and verify it has the proper water heater.  With respect to commercial buildings   that need additional fixtures he ensures the fixtures are installed properly, that they be   handicap accessible and verify there are the proper amount of toilets and sinks.  He has   participated in inspections for the Green Dolphin bar at 2200 N. Ashland Avenue, the last      5   inspection being performed the date before the hearing.  He inspected as early as May of   2010.  He found several violations such as inadequate amount of toilet sinks, hand sinks   and mop sink.  There were additional fixtures that had been installed without a permit.    There were no handicap facilities and an inadequate number of lavatories with improper   water service.  There was also a problem with the mop sink which was potentially   dangerous and hazardous.          The inspection the day before the hearing revealed that a plumbing permit was   pulled earlier this year.  Some of the violations had been addressed, but the main   violations concerning adding sufficient plumbing fixtures, upgrading the water service   and adding handicapped accessibility to the bathroom remained.  With the permit the   licensee did install hand sinks behind the bar but they were installed improperly.  The   drain was tied into the downspout underneath the floor when it should have been   connected to the sewer.  This could cause the release of sewer gas in the room after it   rains.  The bathrooms have not come into compliance and he discussed with the architect   at the inspection the number of fixtures that would be needed.  At present the corrected   violations would be service work, not major corrections and the plumbing counts left   open are more important than what has been done.          Haran acknowledged being present for some of the status conferences in building   court but could not recall a status on May 30, 2011, and did not recall Judge Hughes    asking if he had concerns about dangerous conditions on the premises.  He added there is   nothing dangerous now but added if the traps are sucked out of the sink it could cause      6   allowed the licensee to continue operation under the occupancy limits set out in that   order.          This Commission is concerned that it may appear that the License Appeal   Commission is being used by the City to get a ruling giving it the relief it did not get in   the Circuit Court.  Questions of collateral estoppel and/or res judicata might be properly   argued.  The fact is that it was the licensee that filed this appeal conveying jurisdiction on   this Commission.  Neither party has objected to the jurisdiction of this Commission or to   how this Commission has proceeded in this case.         It is the decision of this Commissioner that the issue of non-renewal for suitability   is not the same as the issue of whether the conditions of the property provide an imminent   threat to the health, safety and welfare of the occupants and the public.  The evidence   presented by the City meets its burden that the premises are not suitable for renewal.  The   decision of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner to Refuse to Renew the liquor   licenses for 2200 N. Ashland Avenue LLC is affirmed.                                                                    Dennis M. Fleming   Chairman    12

In mid-November, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 3,956  feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Halmin Avenue (56th Street-58th Street) and in W. 57th Place  (Pulaski-Central Park). The old water main dates back to 1913, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    23rd Ward Office: 773-582-4444    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,609 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Kenmore Avenue, from  W. Granville Avenue to W. Thorndale Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Osterman’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely.

Eisenhower were born.                  KENMORE AVENUE WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,609 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Kenmore Avenue, from W. Granville Avenue to W. Thorndale Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  main dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late December 2012. Restoration will follow in late May 2013. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Kenmore Avenue outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                                                 ALDERMAN HARRY OSTERMAN   3-1-1   773-784-5277   312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late December.  Restoration will follow in late May 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.                Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

By late July 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 537 feet of new 8-inch and 262 feet of new 12-inch  water main in W. 105th Place, from S. Church Street to S. Vincennes Avenue and S. Vincennes  Avenue, from W. 103rd Street to W. 107th Street. The old water main dates back to 1896, and needs  to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  19th Ward Office: 773-238-8766  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

In August, the Department of Water Management’s crews will begin work to install a new  sewer main in N. McVicker Avenue (George-330’ north), in N. Meade Avenue (George-330’  north), and in N. Moody Avenue (George-330’ north). The old sewer dates back to 1920 and  needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will  be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    45th Ward Office: 773-286-4545    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.

10742`https://www.cityofchicago.org/dam/city/depts/ethics/general/AO_Lobby/98056-AO-redact.pdf`Success`Success`3`3`Not a fillable PDF.`ADVISORY OPINION CASE NO. 98056.A Lobbying  To:  { } Attorney at Law  Date: December 16 , 1998  In a November 5, 1998 letter to the Board, you presented an issue concerning the unpaid president of a trade association who, on behalf of the association and its members, wishes to make unsolicited, public comment before the Finance Committee of City Council on a pending ordinance.  You requested an advisory opinion on whether this president, or the trade association itself, must register as a lobbyist.  Under the facts presented, the Board has determined that the president of the trade association, but not the association itself, is acting as a lobbyist.  If the president’s lobbying-related compensation or expenditures total $1,000 or more in the preceding or current calender year, he must register as a lobbyist and file semi-annual reports of lobbying activities with the Board.  A summary of the facts and relevant law follow, along with the Board’s analysis.  FACTS,  RELEVANT  LAW  AND  ANALYSIS:    Your  client  is  a  trade association  that  wishes  to  have  its  president  appear  before  the  Finance Committee  of  City  Council  and  make  unsolicited,  public  comment  on  a proposed  ordinance.    Section  2-156-010(p)  of  the  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance defines a lobbyist as:   .  .  . any person (i) who for compensation or on behalf of any person other than himself undertakes to influence any legislative or administrative action; or (ii) any part of whose duties as an employee of another includes undertaking to influence any legislative or administrative action.   Section 2-156-010(o) of the Ordinance defines “legislative action” as:  .  .  .  the  introduction,  sponsorship,  consideration,  debate, amendment, passage, defeat, approval, veto or other official action or non-action on any ordinance, resolution, motion, order, appointment, application or other matter pending or proposed  in  the  City  Council  or  any  committee  or subcommittee thereof.  You have said that the president of the association is “unpaid” and “is not an employee” of the association.  However, in making the proposed comments, he  Case No. 98056.A December 16, 1998 Page 2  would clearly be undertaking to influence legislative action on behalf of a person other than himself, i.e., the association. Section 2-156-010(o) explicitly includes debate on an ordinance in the definition of “legislative action.”  Thus, under the facts presented, the president of the trade association is acting as a lobbyist.  Next, the Board considers the issue of whether the president of the trade association must register with the Board as a lobbyist.  Section 2-156-210 of the Ordinance provides:  each  lobbyist  whose  lobbying-related  compensation  or  expenditures  total $1,000.00 or more in the preceding or current calendar year shall register and file reports with the Board of Ethics.   Section 2-156-010(f) defines “compensation” as:  money, thing of value or other pecuniary benefit received or to be received in return for, or as reimbursement for, services rendered or to be rendered.  Section 2-156-010(k) defines “expenditure” as:   a payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value.  The  fact  that  the  president  of  the  association  is  “unpaid”  is  not  dispositive  of  whether  he  must register.  Under the Ordinance, compensation is not limited to money; rather, it includes any thing of value or other pecuniary benefit received or to be received in return for, or as reimbursement for, services.    Furthermore,  although  your  letter  does  not  indicate  whether  you  anticipate  that  the president of the trade association will incur expenditures, e.g. payment of transportation and lodging costs, in relation to his lobbying activities, that, too, must be considered.  In conclusion, if either the compensation received or the expenditures made by the association's president in the preceding or current calendar year total $1,000 or more, the president must register as a lobbyist and file semi- annual reports of lobbying activities with the Board.  Finally, the Board concludes that the trade association itself is not acting as a lobbyist under the facts presented.  In situations where a company hires a lobbyist in an effort to influence legislative or administrative action, it has not been the Board’s practice to require the company itself to register as a lobbyist, even though the company could be said to be acting on behalf of its shareholders; the disclosure intended by the Ordinance is made when the lobbyist identifies the company as a client in the lobbyist’s own registration.  In the present situation as well, the Board does not believe that any purpose would be served by requiring the trade association to register as a lobbyist, or that the association is in fact acting as a lobbyist on behalf of its members, under the intent of the Ordinance.  DETERMINATIONS: The Board determines that the unpaid president of a trade association is acting as a lobbyist when, on behalf of the association, he appears before City Council and makes  Case No. 98056.A December 16, 1998 Page 3  unsolicited, public comment on a pending ordinance.  The Board also determines that the trade association itself, under the facts presented, is not acting as a lobbyist.  If the president’s lobbying- related compensation or expenditures total $1,000 or more in the preceding or current calender year, he must register as a lobbyist and file semi-annual reports of lobbying activities with the Board.  Our determinations are based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify the Board immediately, as any change may alter our determination.   RELIANCE: This opinion may be relied upon by (1) any person involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered and (2) any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.  __________________ Darryl L.

By early January 2018, Department of Water Management (DWM) and NPL Construction Company  crews will begin the work to install 9,219 feet of new 8-inch water main in W. Eddy Street, from   N. Long Avenue to N. Cicero Avenue, W. Cornelia Avenue, from N. Long Avenue to N. Cicero Avenue,  N. Long Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W. Cornelia Avenue and N. Lavergne Avenue, from   W. Addison Street to W. Cornelia Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1909, and needs to be  replaced. We expect the water main work to be completed by late March 2018. Restoration will  follow in mid April 2018. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  30th Ward Office: 773-794-3095      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

Matthew Imig, President     Applicant (Expansion of Use)   for the premises located at     2249 North Lincoln Avenue            vs.                                           Local Liquor Control Commission     Department of Business Affairs & Licensing   Scott V. Bruner, Director                   OPINION OF COMMISSIONER KOPPEL      ORDER    LAC Case No.  06 LA 05    )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )   This matter comes before the License Appeal Commission on the refusal of the Mayor=s   License Commission to grant an expansion of use to an applicant who has been in business for   many years without violation.  The expansion of the premises would allow a private party room   on the second floor.  It should be noted again that no violations have been issued.  This place   serves food, but the Alderman and some area residents are opposed to the expansion of business   because it will add to the existing problems of the district.  The Mayor=s License Commission is   aware that this place has an incidental liquor license but is concerned that the expansion will be a   problem.  They are concerned that the establishment will serve more liquor than food and that   this will cause a deleterious impact upon the community.                                  1   The denial is predicated upon conjecture.  The law is quite clear.  This is a question of   due process.  The City is aware of the procedure, if a licensee with an incidental liquor license   sells more liquor than food, then his license is subject to revocation.  In the charging document   the City was aware of the law.  They indicated that it is the intent of this department to   investigate the applicant=s liquor versus food sales.  That is the remedy for selling more alcohol   than food.  To deny the expansion, when it met every criteria and with no violations as long as   they have been in business is unjust.        There are many ways to revoke a license.  This is called due process.  The City is aware   of the many reasons to revoke a license predicated upon violations of the law.  There are no   violations in this case.  To deny a legitimate business owner on conjecture is improper.  The City   is hereby reversed.       OPINION OF COMMISSIONER ADAMS    While the City=s witnesses were credible and concerned citizens, very few, if any,   testified about area problems that were directly tied to the licensed premises - O=Malley=s.         In fact, the evidence showed that the applicants are responsible businessmen who have   made sincere efforts to reach out to the community.  They have had no violations since obtaining   the business in 2000 and have passed every police check (6 of them) for underage sales.  Great   weight should be given to the testimony of the City authority closest to the scene, Beat Officer   Parada, who spoke well of the business and did not feel a liquor license extension for the second                       2   floor would have any negative or deleterious impact on the community.       The Local Liquor Control Commission=s denial was not proven by any bad acts attributed   to the applicants.  The City=s primary argument of Alet=s draw the line@ on alcohol sales is not   proof of a deleterious impact.        Good intentions of the City should not be considered a substitute for evidence.  The   denial of the application is reversed.         OPINION OF CHAIRMAN CALABRESE IN DISSENT    The licensee applicant seeks to expand his currently licensed liquor establishment.  The   applicant=s establishment is one of 14 liquor establishments located within a 2 block radius.  Six   of these licenses are tavern licenses, while eight are consumption on premises incidental activity   licenses.  The City denied the expansion on the grounds of deleterious impact, citing opposition   by the Alderman and community residents, as a result of existing problems in the neighborhood.          The local Alderman testified in opposition to the expansion of the license.  She pointed   out problems of public rowdiness and public urination already existing as a result of the over   saturation of liquor licenses in the two block area of the applicant=s establishment.  An applicant   witness, a Chicago Police Officer, testified that >lines of kids= are already waiting to be admitted   to the premises.                        3      The City presented many local residents who strongly objected to the expansion of the   license.  The citizens complained of littering, noise, public urination, fist fights and criminal   damage to property, as a result of what one witness referred to as the >alcohol tourism= of bar   hopping revelers.  Citizens complained that the applicants have not been considerate neighbors,   dumping refuse water out their back door into the alley and causing an odoriferous nuisance.    One neighbor complained that she has found underpants, condoms, liquor bottles and cans on her   lawn.  Parking was described as an enormous problem.  Citizens were very afraid that if this   expansion is allowed that it will set a precedent for the expansion of the other liquor   establishments allowing the problem as they suggested to >go vertical=.        The decision by the Local Liquor Control Commission simply denies the expansion of a   license in an area that has proven to be over saturated with liquor emporiums and is reeling with   the impact of rampant alcohol abuse by young people visiting the neighborhood.  The evidence   presented at the hearing of the abuses being suffered by the residents was as clear as can be.    There is no doubt that the expansion of this license would clearly contribute to an already   existing deleterious impact.  If the Local Liquor Control Commission is not allowed to deny   expansion in this case, then when can, as the witness and Corporation Counsel rightly argued,   the line be drawn?  I would have affirmed the City=s denial of the expansion.                                               4        THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED That the said order or action of the Local      Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago be and the same hereby is REVERSED.       Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a Petition for Rehearing may be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order is deemed  to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the Circuit Court, the  Petition for Rehearing must be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order, as  such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

Spatz, Jr.  Coinmissioner   At Alderman Smith's request, I am providing you with material related to a project  coming to your neighborhood.  I want to be certain you are we11 informed, and that  you know where to call if there are any questions or concerns.   Our crews are installing 1,623 feet of 8-inch water main in W.  Early Avenue (N.  Glenwood Avenue to N. Broadway).   I have asked my staff to assemble this material for you, and also to stay in close  touch with the project.  We know that construction always has some  inconveniences and noise associated with it, but we want to do everything we can  to minimize the inconvenience and conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful  neighbors during our time in your street.   Please feel free to call Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at (3 12) 742-1 029, at  any time.  In the meantime, thank you in advance for your understanding and good  will.   Sincerely   John F. Spatz, Jr.  Commissioner   City of Chicago  Richard M. Daley   Mayor   Depament of Water Managemnet   John F. Spatz, Jr.  Coinmissioner   Do you wonder what was happening in 1890? That's the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:   CY YOUNG IN ACTION   The first U.S.  college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.  W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.  Idaho and Wyoming became states.  Congress created the Weather Bureau.  Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.  X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.  Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.  The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.  Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.   City ofChicago  ~ichard M.  ~ a i e ~    Mayor   Deparhnent of Water Managemnet   John F. Spatz, Jr.  Co~nmissioner   PROJECT DESCRIPTION   Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,623 feet of 8-inch water main in  W. Early Avenue (N. Glenwood Avenue to N.  Broadway).   Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and we can expect increasingly fiequent breaks if we don't  replace it.   Timing: Water main installation is anticipated to begin in early March 201 0 with completion of  this project projected for beginning of June 2010. Completion of this project includes  restoration. This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected developments in the  street, or other circumstances (e.g.  weather) that force us to adjust our schedules.   Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Early Avenue without interruption, but we will  have to restrict parking around our work zone.   Parking: We will post our work area for ""No Parking"" as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.   Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1   ALDERMAN MARY ANN SMITH   773-784-5277   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029   City ofCi~ica~o  Riclmd M. Daley   Mayor   Department of water Managemnet   John F. Spatz, Jr.  Commissioner   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS   What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 3 12-742-1 029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it's  off hours.   Can I park when you're  not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.   Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude the middle of May  20 10. Restoration will follow in early June 20 10. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.   Will you shut my water O W  Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.   Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.   "

MARTIN, PRESIDENT,   from the order of a five-day Suspension of the Mayor, as Local Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago,    entered and taken JUNE 4, 2007 and the Commission having reviewed the said appeal and the transcript of proceedings   taken before the Mayor, as Local Liquor Control Commissioner, and the parties having made oral argument and the    Commission now fully advised in the premises DOTH FIND:   A) 	  B) 	  That the Mayor, as Local Liquor Control Commissioner has proceeded in the manner   provided by law.   That the finding of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner that the licensee failed to maintain   liquor license liability (dram shop) insurance for the licensed premises from November 18, 2005   through December 15, 2005, is not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.    This Commission further finds as a matter of law that the City failed to prove that the licensee failed   to maintain liquor liability (dram shop) insurance for the licensed premises from November 18, 2005  through December 18, 2005, in violation of the Municipal Code, Title 4, Chapter 60, 040 (c) (2).    It should also be noted that the provision of the Municipal Code alleged to have been violated by the  licensee and found to have been violated by the licensee by the Hearing Officer is Title 4, Chapter 60,  Section 040 (c) (1).  That section of the Municipal Code does not address the issue of liability (dram  shop) insurance.   C) 	  That the order of a five-day suspension is not supported by the findings of the Local Liquor Control   1    Commission.     IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND ADJUDGED That the order suspending the liquor license of the appellant    for FIVE (5) Days is REVERSED.   Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a Petition for Rehearing may be filed with this Commission  within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.

By late November 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,262 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Essex  Avenue, from E. 91st Street to E. 93rd Street. The old water main dates back to 1893 and needs to be  replaced. We expect the water main work to be completed by mid January 2018. Restoration will  follow in mid April 2018. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  7th Ward Office: 773-731-7777  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

On February 28, 2014, Officer Little filed with the Police Board a request for Police   Board review of this suspension. On March 6, 2014, Officer Little filed with the Police Board a   memorandum delineating specific reasons for which the review was requested.    The Executive Director of the Police Board assigned this matter to Hearing Officer   Jacqueline A. Walker.  Hearing Officer Walker reviewed the investigation file and submitted a   written report to the Police Board.     The members of the Police Board reviewed the Summary Report of the investigation file,   the recommendations of Command Channel Review and the Chief of the Bureau of Internal   Affairs, Officer Little’s memorandum, and Hearing Officer Walker’s report.  Hearing Officer   Walker made an oral report to and conferred with the Police Board before it rendered its findings   and decision.    POLICE BOARD FINDINGS   The Police Board of the City of Chicago, as a result of its consideration of this matter,   finds and determines that:   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2320  Police Officer Kerry Little  Findings and Decision                 1.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Kerry Little, Star No. 15888,   violated Rule 24 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On October 19, 2011, Police Officer Kerry Little failed to report to the Medical Services  Section for a follow-up appointment as scheduled, and did not report or contact the Medical  Services Section until November 28, 2011.        Sergeant Eileen Guest submitted a report indicating that Officer Little, who was on the   medical roll, was scheduled to report to the Medical Services Section on October 19, 2011, for a   follow-up appointment, and that he failed to appear.  Sergeant Guest further reported that Officer   Little did not contact the Medical Services Section until November 28, 2011.  Sergeant Rodney   Smith of the Medical Integrity Unit confirmed Sergeant Guest’s report.      Additionally, on November 28, 2011, Officer Little was decertified from the Medical   Roll because of the 41 days between October 19, 2011 and November 28, 2011, when he failed   to appear at the Medical Services Section.  Officer Little was subsequently recertified on   December 6, 2011, when he submitted the necessary documentation.    Officer Little stated that he was the victim of an armed robbery just after midnight on   October 19, 2011.  He also stated that he phoned the Medical Services Section at 7:32 that   morning and left a detailed voice-mail message for Officer Neary, and that he never heard back   from anyone in the Medical Services Section. The Board finds that neither of these   circumstances justifies Officer Little’s failure to contact the Medical Services section for 41   days.      2.   The Police Board has considered the facts and circumstances of Officer Little’s   conduct, and his complimentary and disciplinary histories.        2   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2320  Police Officer Kerry Little  Findings and Decision                 Chicago police officers receive full pay and benefits for a period of absence from work   due to illness or injury, provided such illness or injury is certified by the Medical Services   Section. Officer Little shirked his duty to report promptly to the Medical Services Section,   thereby undermining the integrity of the process for providing officers with this important   benefit.  His failure to report is a serious offense, and the fifteen-day suspension recommended in   this case is not unwarranted.        POLICE BOARD DECISION      The Police Board of the City of Chicago hereby adopts the findings set forth herein by   the following vote:      By a vote of 8 in favor (Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William  F. Conlon, Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, and Elisa Rodriguez) to 0  opposed, the Board sustains the allegation that Police Officer Kerry Little violated Rule 24.     As a result of the foregoing, the Board, by a vote of 7 in favor (Carney, Foreman, Conlon,   Eaddy, Fry, McKeever, and Rodriguez) to 1 opposed (Ballate), hereby determines that cause   exists for suspending Police Officer Kerry Little from his position as a police officer with the   Department of Police, and from the services of the City of Chicago, for a period of fifteen (15)   days.   NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the suspension of Police   Officer Kerry Little, Star No. 15888, for a period of fifteen (15) days is sustained.    This disciplinary action is adopted and entered by a majority of the members of the   Police Board: Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, William F. Conlon, Michael Eaddy, Rita A.   Fry, Susan L. McKeever, and Elisa Rodriguez.         3   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2320  Police Officer Kerry Little  Findings and Decision                 DATED AT CHICAGO, COUNTY OF COOK, STATE OF ILLINOIS, THIS 15th DAY   OF MAY, 2014.             Attested by:   /s/ Demetrius E. Carney  President          /s/ Max A. Caproni  Executive Director        4         Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2320  Police Officer Kerry Little  Findings and Decision                 DISSENT   I dissent from the Decision of the majority of the Board with regard to the penalty.  Based   on the facts of this case and the lack of any prior discipline of Officer Little, I find that the 15-  day suspension is not warranted, and I vote to reduce the length of the suspension.             /s/ Melissa M.

In August, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 2,626 feet of new  8-inch water main in W. Roscoe Street (Ashland-Southport) and in N. Greenview Avenue (Roscoe- Belmont). The old water main dates back to 1891, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    44th Ward Office: 773-525-6034    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner      Genwmnot03032016

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

The Department seeks to minimize  the burden of the audit process and improve the efficient use of audit resources by  implementing a program whereby taxpayers take an active role in the audit process.      The purpose of the managed audit is to provide a thorough education to the taxpayer on each  tax type covered by the program with less of a disruption to the taxpayer than a standard  audit might involve.  Our goal is to create a relationship with each taxpayer whereby that  taxpayer’s overall compliance with all City taxes is improved.      A managed audit is an audit performed by the taxpayer, under the direction and guidance of  the Department of Finance, pursuant to a formal written agreement outlining the duties and  obligations of each party.  The auditor will provide specific written instructions for the  taxpayer and will review the work of the taxpayer.  This program is an alternative to the  standard audit and provides incentives for taxpayers.  The program will reduce the average  hours required to complete an audit and will assist the Department in administering and  enforcing taxes more efficiently.      This program will provide benefits to the taxpayer and the Department.  By allowing  taxpayers the opportunity to be directly involved in the review of their books and records,  they will better understand the specific applications of the taxes to their operations, possibly  identify operational processes that require modification, and receive penalty and/or interest  waivers on the resulting liability.  The Department will benefit from the program by freeing  auditor time to pursue other enforcement matters with other taxpayers.                                                   Managed Audit Process    Department of Finance management will evaluate cases, individually, to identify specific  cases for managed audits.    Auditors will conduct opening conferences with business representatives to understand  accounting systems and available records, determine whether the taxpayer is a candidate for a  managed audit. And discuss the managed audit process and procedures with the authorized  business representatives to insure that they understand what is required and what benefits  they will receive.    Auditors will prepare a managed audit agreement, including a detailed explanation of the  specific audit steps of the audit that the taxpayer will be completing establish deadlines  providing specific dates by which the taxpayer will have its audit work completed, present  the agreement to the audit supervisor for his/her approval before presenting it to the taxpayer,  and discuss processes and procedures for requesting additional time to complete audit work.      Auditors will review and/or test taxpayers’ worksheets and summary schedules.    The completed audit will be submitted for supervisor review as if it were a regular audit, and  it will go through the normal review and point clearance process.     Auditors will prepare amended returns and validate liability for each period under review.    Auditors will process all penalty and interest waivers pursuant to the Managed Audit  Agreement.      A closing conference will be held with the taxpayer where copies of the audit file are  provided to the taxpayer along with amended returns for approval and authorized signatures  of the taxpayer.      Although full payment of audit-determined liability is expected, payment plans can be  entered.  Although the program provides for interest waivers on audit determined liabilities,  interest accrues throughout the payment plan term on the full amount of tax outstanding.                                             Audit Methodology, Sampling and Workpapers    The methodology used to compute or otherwise determine the amount due or level of  compliance will be discussed before any detailed work is undertaken.  The methodology will  be documented and agreed upon before the detailed work is started to insure that both parties  understand what work needs to be done and how it will be summarized.  The approach used  will be very similar to that used by the Department during the course of any other audit.   Sample periods can be utilized when circumstances warrant and actual reviews of entire audit  periods can also be conducted if necessary.  Sample periods will be identified and agreed  upon by both parties.    The Department will provide workpaper templates for use in documenting the audit findings.   These templates are intended to provide taxpayers with a guide of how the detail is to be  summarized.  Fluctuations from the standard templates are acceptable but should be  discussed before hand.  The objective is to have the audit work summarized in such a manner  that the auditor can efficiently review the work to verify that the liabilities, if any, have been  computed correctly.  If the taxpayer has suggestions or recommendations that it believes will  achieve the objective yet require less time, those concerns should be raised directly with the  auditor.      At the conclusion of the detailed work, the auditor will meet with the taxpayer to review the  schedules compiled and perform a limited verification of the records reviewed and  summarized.  Once satisfied that all testing was done to his/her satisfaction, the auditor will  present the file to his/her supervisor for final review.  No payments are required or expected  until after the supervisor has accepted and approved the audit.  In the event that something is  incomplete or not completed to the satisfaction of the supervisor, the auditor may need to  revisit the business to obtain explanations or additional records.  After supervisory approval  has been secured, amended tax returns will be generated using the audit-determined findings,  and taxpayers will sign and file those returns, which will include all agreed penalty and  interest waivers.  Settlements must be either within pre-approved parameters or specifically  approved by the appropriate supervisors within the Departments of Finance and Law.                                                 Managed Audit Agreements    A managed audit agreement (MAA) is an agreement between the Department of Finance and  a taxpayer that specifies an agreed-upon methodology for calculating and remitting a tax.   Many state and local taxing jurisdictions across the United States are utilizing some form of  MAA to improve their efficiency and overall effectiveness.      Increased demand for greater efficiencies in government has prompted many taxing  authorities to consider alternatives to improve overall compliance levels.  The traditional  audit has been the most common tool used in tax enforcement.  The MAA will enhance that  process by involving taxpayers in their own audits.  In addition to an elimination and/or  reduction of penalties and interest, taxpayers will also benefit from an MAA because it will  allow them an opportunity to analyze their own business operations and possibly identify  areas where changes can be made to make their own operations more effective and compliant  with City taxes.      Eligibility for program    A taxpayer’s inclusion in an MAA is based on its willingness and ability to participate.   Generally the Department will consider entering into an MAA with taxpayers who have  maintained an acceptable system of business records, cooperated with any previous tax  enforcement efforts of the Department and demonstrated a willingness and ability to comply  with the tax laws.      Taxpayers with whom the Department may decline to enter into an MAA include those who  have failed to cooperate in past audits, those who have failed to remedy improper reporting  practices identified in a prior audit, those who have been or currently are the subject of  ongoing criminal investigations, or those who maintain poor internal controls or inadequate  systems of business records.      The Department will negotiate in a spirit of cooperation for a methodology and agreement  that will meet the needs of both parties.                                 Chicago Department of Finance   MANAGED AUDIT AGREEMENT                This managed audit agreement (MAA”) is entered into between the Chicago Department of  Finance (“Department”) and                                                                                (“Taxpayer”),  to conduct a managed audit of the ____________________________Tax for the period   of                                 through                          .          The parties agree to the following:    1.  The Taxpayer will review appropriate books and records as determined by the audit plan.  This review will identify unreported transactions and/or receipts for the above period and  should be completed within                   days from the signing of this agreement.   Amendments to this time frame during the course of the audit may be necessary to facilitate  completion.  All records, work papers and computations will be made available to the  Department for verification.     2.  The Department agrees to accept upon verification, for assessment purposes, the  taxpayer’s determination of unreported transactions, receipts and/or tax.  If the Taxpayer  complies with the audit plan and all other provisions of the MAA, the Department will (a)  waive all penalties, and (b) waive half of the interest computed due, with the waiver of  interest limited to a maximum amount of $20,000.     3.  The Department has provided written procedural guidelines to be included as part of this  audit which specify the portion(s) of the audit that the Taxpayer is to conduct.  This guidance  includes the general scope of the audit, specific records expected to be reviewed, specific test  periods or methodologies to be used, layout of appropriate schedules and other technical  information necessary to complete the review as detailed in the audit plan.  The Department  will be available for ongoing consultation during the audit as issues or concerns develop.      4.  The Department will arrange a closing conference with the Taxpayer to provide the results  of the audit.

In mid to late March, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin  work to install a junction structure at the intersection of Central Avenue and 62nd Street.     During construction (about 6 weeks), the southbound lane of Central Avenue will be closed  (the northbound lane will remain open).  Traffic will be directed by a flagger. You will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Safety is always our first consideration.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    23rd Ward Office: 773-582-4444    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.

Starting in early February, the Department of Water Management’s crews will install a new  sewer main in W. Chase Avenue, from Clark to Paulina. The old sewer dates back to 1955  and needs to be replaced.     This project includes making a connection to the existing sewer at the intersection of Chase  and Clark and as such, the full and continuous closure and detour of Clark is required for a  few days. Otherwise, when we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety  reasons, but you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working  hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    49th Ward Office: 773-338-5796    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.

Board Members   There are indications from the Mayor’s Office that an appointment of two new members  is imminent.     I am also pleased to announce that Pastor Mary Carr has been re-appointed for a full 4- year term, expiring July 31, 2019.      Education-Classes    Staff continues to work with the Department of Innovation & Technology (“DOIT”) to  replace the system for scheduling people for 4-year classes. The requirements document  was submitted to DOIT in early May, and we met with the programmers on June 8 and   Open Session Minutes  June 24, 2015  Page 2     will again meet with them on June 29.  We aim to have the new system running by the end of  2015.     Twelve employees attended classes May 28 and June 9; nine (9) are scheduled for class on July  7.    On June 4, the Executive Director participated in a panel discussion on Ethics for Government  Attorneys,  together  with  representatives  from  the  Attorney  Registration  and  Disciplinary  Commission and the John Marshall Law School.    On June 10, staff conducted a class for the 48th Ward staff, and on June 26 will conduct a class  for the 15th Ward.    On June 23, staff conducted a program for senior City Council staff (especially Chiefs of Staff).   50 employees attended.    On July 13, staff will host a delegation of anti-corruption officials from Kyrgyzstan.    The Executive Director was invited to serve as a panelist on organizational ethics at the Annual  Meeting and Conference on Teaching and Learning of the American Accounting Association in  Chicago.  The presentation would be on Sunday, August 9.      Staff is scheduling several classes for all other  City Council staff employees and independent  contractors.      C.                      D.                       To  date,  all  but  one  (1)  employee  and  six  (6)  appointed  officials  required  to  file  their  2015 Statements of Financial Interests by June 1 have filed.  As per the Ordinance, the  Executive Director has determined that 31 employees and 34 appointed officials violated  the Ordinance by failure to file by that deadline. Of these, 4 were assessed fines of $250  per  day,  and  the  remaining  seven  (7)  non-filers  continue  to  accrue  a  $250  daily  fine.   Staff  notified  all  late  filers  and  will  notify  their  department  heads  (and  the  Office  of  Legislative  Counsel  and  Governmental  Affairs)  next  week.  The  names  of  all  filers  determined  to  have  violated  the  Ordinance  will  be  posted  on  the  Board’s  website  beginning on July 1.   2015 Statements of Financial Interests    On-line Training     To date, 497 lobbyists have completed the 2014-2015 lobbyist program.  Their deadline  is June 30. Reminders were sent on June 1 and June 15.   To  date,  14,250  employees  have  completed  the  2015  mandatory  education  program.  Their deadline is December 31, 2015.  Staff released a DVD version of the training to  those departments that have requested it, to enable them to ensure that employees without  computer access complete the training by the deadline. The aldermanic version will be  released in August.   Open Session Minutes  June 24, 2015  Page 3   Ongoing Investigative Record     E.                F.            G.

The record is  consistent with the confidentiality provisions of the Ordinance.   Lobbyists-regulation and enforcement   Currently, 575 lobbyists are registered for 2015, and the agency has collected $297,751 in  lobbyists’  registration  fees.  On  June  23,  we  sent  notices  reminding  lobbyists  of  the  upcoming July 20 deadline to file their quarterly reports.    Lobbyists—Inspector General Audit   The  auditing  personnel  in  the  IG’s  office  met  with  staff  on  June  11,  and  are  nearing  completion  of  their  tentative  audit  report.    They  presented  their  tentative  conclusions.   Some  included  helpful  suggestions,  others  would  appear  to  require  amendments  to  the  Ordinance, and still others appear to be based on a reading of the Ordinance with which  professional staff disagrees.   Summer Student Interns   We are pleased that we will be hosting two high school students, one in an unpaid and the  other in a paid internship, beginning June 29 and July 6, through August 7.  Our paid  intern is participating through a program that is managed by ASPIRA,  Inc. of  Illinois,  which is our Board member Daisy Lezama’s employer; our unpaid intern is participating  through the City’s Department of Human Resources.   Proposed Amendments to the Ordinance   At  last  week’s  City  Council  meeting,  a  package  of  amendments  to  the  Ordinance  was  submitted to the City Council.  If necessary, the Executive Director will appear before the  Council’s Committee on Rules & Ethics to answer questions about the proposal, prior to  the next City Council meeting, scheduled for July 29.   Advisory Opinions     Since the May 2015 meeting, the agency has issued 307 confidential informal advisory  opinions (in addition to those formal opinions issued or approved by the Board).     •     •        The leading categories in this period (in descending order) were: travel, gifts, the   reverse revolving door, post-employment, and lobbying.   49%  of  these  were  from  City  employees  in  administrative  or  management  positions,  13%  from  non-administrative  or  managerial  employees,  18%  from  lobbyists, 1% from City other government agencies, 4% from department heads,   Open Session Minutes  June 24, 2015  Page 4                                  K.

Employees or officials from nearly every City department (including the City   Council) are represented, with the most numerous ones, in descending order,   coming from employees or official in: City Council, Office of the Mayor, Chicago  Public Library, Public Health, Police, Law, and Buildings.

Sawyer’s (6th Ward) request, I am providing you with information  regarding a water construction project in your neighborhood. This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,312 feet of 8-inch water main in E. 74th Street, from S.  Cottage Grove Avenue to S. Ingleside Avenue, S. Ingelside Avenue, from E. 74th Street to E. 75th  Street, S. Drexel Boulevard, from 380 feet North of 74th Street to E. 75th Street, and S. Ellis  Avenue, from 350 feet North of E. 75th Street to E. 75th Street. The old pipe dates back to 1891,  and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Sawyer’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:            Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap   and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.                                      74TH, INGELSIDE, DREXEL AND ELLIS WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,312 feet of 8-inch  water main in E. 74th Street, from S. Cottage Grove Avenue to S. Ingleside Avenue, S. Ingelside  Avenue, from E. 74th Street to E. 75th Street, S. Drexel Boulevard, from 380 feet North of 74th  Street to E. 75th Street, and S. Ellis Avenue, from 350 feet North of E. 75th Street to E. 75th  Street..    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1891and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by late January 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on E. 74th Street, S. Ingelside Avenue, S. Drexel  Boulevard, and S. Ellis Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the  street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your  home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a  lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                                                 ALDERMAN RODERICK T. SAWYER   3-1-1   773-635-0006   312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  January 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

10708`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/ethics/general/AO_GiftsTravel/03009.Q.pdf`Success`Success`1`1`Not a fillable PDF.`CONFIDENTIAL   February 3,  2003   [John Smith]  {Title],  Department of [R]   Chicago,  IL 606xx   Re:   Case No. 03009.Q   Dear [Mr.  Smith]:   On  January  31,  2003,  you  asked  whether  the  City's  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  prohibits  either the  [I]  Corporation, a City  vendor,  from  offering,  to  the  City's  [H)  and  [M]  project teams  (comprising  about  7 City employees,  including  you),  or  these  team  members  from  accepting,  dinner  at  a  local  restaurant  to  celebrate  the  implementation  of  these  two  projects.  Both  projects  involve  programs  created  by  [I]  under  City  contracts  still  active,  and  project  team  members  are  able  to  make  decisions  or  take  actions  affecting  [l's]  contract  and  ongoing City business.  This letter confirms our conversation of January 31,  2003,  in  which  we  advised  you  of  Board  staff's  conclusion  that,  because  each  team  member is  in  a position  to  affect [l's]  City  business,  pursuant to§§ 2-156-040  (b)  and  (c)  of  the  Ordinance,  so  long  as:  1)  the  value  of  the  dinner  to  each  City  employee comes to  less than  $50;  and  2)  the dinner offer is  not made or accepted  based on  any mutual understanding that team members' official actions,  decisions  or judgments concerning [l's] City business would be affected by the offer, then the  Ordinance  neither  prohibits  [I]  from  making  this  offer,  nor team  members  from  accepting it.   Our conclusion  regarding  this  offer is  based  solely on  the  application  of the  City's  the  facts  presented;  other  laws,  rules,  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  to  regulations or policies may apply to the  situation.  If any of the  facts  stated  in  this  letter are  inaccurate or incomplete,  please  inform  us  immediately,  as  any  change  could alter our conclusion.  We appreciate your concern to abide by the standards  contained in the Ordinance.  Please contact us with any further questions.   Yours very truly,   Steven I.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,028 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Lawndale Avenue, from  N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Milwaukee Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1907, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Reboyras’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Ariel Reboyras                     30th Ward    1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1               Do you wonder what was happening in 1907? That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                         For the first time, a ball dropped in Times Square in New York to signal the new year.    President Theodore Roosevelt shook a record 8,513 hands in one day.    The first cabs with taxi meters began operating in London.    Finland became the first European country to give women the right to vote.    The automatic washer and dryer were introduced.    Oklahoma became the 46th State.    Actor John Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa.                                               LAWNDALE WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,028 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Lawndale Avenue, from N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Milwaukee Avenue     Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1907 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late October. Restoration will follow in late November. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Lawndale outside of our working hours.  When we are  working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able  to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN ARIEL REBOYRAS   773-794-3095      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late October.  Restoration will be completed in late November. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

CHAIR’S REPORT            III.     EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT   A.   Education     Classes and Other Presentations    Since the last Board meeting, 114 employees and officials attended classes held on  December 20 and January 5, 12 and 17.  Staff also conducted a class for the City Clerk  appointee and her Senior Staff on January 12.  There are 129 scheduled for upcoming  classes on January 19 and 26, and February 2, 7 and 16.     On January 19, staff will conduct a class for members of the Commission on Animal  Care and Control, at the request of its Chair.   On February 23, staff will conduct two classes for SSA Commissioners and Service  Provider representatives.   On January 11, at the request of Chair Bill Conlon, the Executive Director and Legal  Counsel made a 25 minute presentation to the Public Affairs Committee of the Union  League Club; the Chair himself was unable to attend.     Open Session Minutes  January 18, 2017  Page 2      On February 14, staff will make a 60 minute presentation to a group of anti-corruption  officials from Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Territories, at the  request of World Chicago and the Mayor’s Office.   On-line Training   As will be reported in greater detail in closed session, on January 4, 2017 the Executive  Director issued 12 probable cause notices to 11 employees and one (1) alderman who  had not completed the 2016 annual mandatory ethics training course as required.   Eight (8) of these have resulted in determinations that the individuals violated the  Ordinance, but no fines will be assessed as they completed it prior to the fine period  taking effect.  As required by law, their names and violations will be posted on the  Board’s website.   A total of 31,159 officials and employees completed the training.  The astoundingly low  number of persons (12) who did not comply with the Ordinance’s deadline is a  testament to the dedication of Board staff, particularly Ed Primer, Doretha Jackson, and  Ana Collazo, and the network of ethics liaisons we have in every department and  aldermanic office.   The 2016-2017 mandatory lobbyist training will be posted, closely coinciding with the  annual lobbyist registration deadline of January 20.   New Educational Materials   All Board educational materials have been fully revised, though, as will be discussed in  closed session, there are further revisions to be made to the “Plain English Guide to  Being Lobbied,” for City employees and officials.       Since the last Board meeting on December 19, 2016, staff has issued 164 informal opinions  (three (3) others are being presented today, pending Board approval). During this time, the  leading categories were, in descending order: travel, gifts, travel, campaign financing, use of  City property/authority*; post-employment, and outside employment.  The leading City  departments from which requesters came in this period were (in descending order): City  Council, Chicago Police Department; Mayor’s Office; Department of Aviation; Department of  Public Health; Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events; and Department of  Finance.  75 of these were from City employees in administrative or management positions; 24 from  non-administrative/managerial employees; 17 from eight (8) individual department heads;  24 from City elected officials (including 13 individual aldermen); four (4) from aldermanic  Chiefs of Staff or staffers calling on behalf of the alderman; two (2) from ethics officials in  other agencies; two (2) from former City department heads; and the remaining 16 from: five  (5) lobbyists, two (2) City appointed officials, six (6) from contractors or vendors; the rest  came from the public and the media (these last are not actually advisory opinions).   50% came via email; 49% via telephone; the remainder via walk-ins.   Several informal opinions of note will be discussed in closed session.     Advisory Opinions    B.      C.   E.      Website Modifications/Advisory Opinions   Open Session Minutes  January 18, 2017  Page 3  *At the recent COGEL (Council on Governmental Ethics Laws) conference, we learned that  this topic was the leading topic of investigations reported by state, county and municipal  ethics commissions with investigative authority between November 2015 and November  2016.     All formal Board opinions are now posted on the Board’s website, in accordance with the  Ordinance’s confidentiality provisions.  Further, summaries and keywords for each of these  opinions are available on the Board’s searchable index of opinions.  There are only a handful  of other ethics agencies that have comparable research tools.   We are unaware of jurisdictions that make their informal opinions public—though there are  others who issue them confidentially and enable requesters to rely on them in the event of  an investigation or enforcement procedure.   Staff is nearing the completion of the next phase: to publish reports of the investigations  conducted by the Board of alleged violations of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance (not of  the former Campaign Financing Ordinance) between 1987 and 2013.  The investigations  themselves are confidential, but the Board is authorized to publish summary reports of its  investigations, findings and recommendations (and has done so in the past). There are  approximately 45 of these.      We continue to post on the Board’s website an ongoing investigative record showing the  status of every completed investigative report brought to the Board by both the Inspector  General (“IG”) (a total of 2 since July 1, 2013) and the former Office of the Legislative  Inspector General (“LIG”), since January 1, 2012, and the status of all 50 petitions to  commence investigations that were presented to the Board by the former Office of the  Legislative Inspector General. It is updated as appropriate, consistent with the Ordinance’s  confidentiality provisions. However, as there have been no completed investigative reports  sent to the Board in nearly one full year, there has been little to update.       July 2013 amendments to the Ordinance provide that, when a person seeks advice from the  Board about past conduct, and discloses to the Board facts leading it to conclude that he or  she committed a past violation of the Ordinance, the Board must determine whether that  violation was minor or non-minor.  If it was minor, the Board, by law, sends the person a  confidential letter of admonition.  If it was non-minor, then, under current law, the person is  advised that he or she may self-report to the inspector general or, if he or she fails to do so  within two weeks, the Board must make that report.     Since the time this provision (§2-156-070(b)) became effective, the Board has advised three  (3) aldermen, one (1) aldermanic staffer, and two (2) department heads or former  department heads that their past conduct violated the Ordinance. In 3 of these 5 cases, one  involving an alderman, the second an aldermanic staffer, and the third a former department   Disclosures of Past Violations   D.

Lobbyists-Regulation and Enforcement   2017 Statements of Financial Interests     head, the Board concluded that the apparent violations were not minor or technical, and the  individuals self-reported to the respective inspector general.  To date, we have received no  reports of commenced investigations (in the case of the former LIG) or completed  investigations (from either the IG or LIG) of any of these matters. In the other cases, the  Board sent confidential letters of admonition, as required by Ordinance. There is no legal  requirement imposed on the IG to report back to the Board on any actions it takes on  matters or persons referred to it by the Board, unless the IG completes an investigation and  submits a petition for a finding of probable cause to the Board based on that investigation.  This is unlike the arrangement in New York City between its Conflicts of Interests Board and  Department of Investigation.  Staff is making preparations to send out the 2017 form to all employees and officials who  will be required to file them by the close of business on May 31, 2017.  We anticipate about  3,600 filers for 2017. This requires sending spreadsheets to each department, aldermanic  office and City Council Committee and to the Office of Legislative Counsel and Government  Affairs with lists of 2016 filers instructing them to update the lists according to the criteria  set by the Board and Ordinance for who must file the form.  As in past years, the Board’s  EFIS system will send out email notices to all filers on or about March 1, 2017.      As of the close of 2016, there were 619 lobbyists registered, and the Board had collected  $346,350 in registration fees. This figure represents about 42% of our operating budget.     The annual registration (or re-registration) deadline for lobbyists is by the close of  business, Friday, January 20.  All lobbyists’ filings must be completed on-line, using the  Board’s ELF system. As of this writing, approximately 175 lobbyists have registered for  2017, and approximately 216 have filed their quarterly reports for the final quarter of 2016,  and the Board has collected $72,250 in registration fees.  All lobbyists who fail to register or  terminate or file activity reports, as required, will be subject to the due process procedures  and penalties for violating the Ordinance, including fines of up to $1,000 per day, and a  public announcement of their violations.   Since the last regularly scheduled Board meeting, the office has received two (2) new  requests under the Freedom of Information Act. One request was a statement about a  Supreme Court case; the requestor was advised this agency had no responsive documents.  The other request was for one filed statement of financial interests from an alderman, and a  request for a list of all penalties for 5 years assessed against the alderman for late filing of  those statements. The requestor was sent a .pdf of the one responsive record the agency  had, and was advised that the Board has no record indicating any penalties imposed for late  filing.

Case No. 16046.C, No Jurisdiction      The Board heard staff’s report on a citizen complaint received and referred to the  Office of Inspector General for action it deems appropriate.    5.  Case No. 16047.C, Money for Advice      The Board heard staff’s report on a citizen complaint received and referred to the  Office of Inspector General for action it deems appropriate.   Member Stephen W. Beard left the meeting at 5:38 p.m.        6.  Case No. 17001.01.TR, et seq., Training    Staff reported that, pursuant to Governmental Ethics Ordinance §§2-156-145 through - 148, and §2-156-465, all City employees and elected officials are required to complete  an online ethics training each year no later than December 31.  Failure to timely  complete this training results in: (i) a finding of an ethics violation; (ii) the public  release of the violator’s name; and (iii) potential fines to the violator ranging from  $200-$750 for each day until the training is completed.  The Board’s Executive Director  imposes the daily fine following a seven (7) day grace period after notifying the subject  of a probable cause violation.    On January 4, 2017, the Board’s staff issued 12 Probable Cause Notices of Ethics  Violations to individuals who had not completed the 2016 training.  Of those cases,  there were eight (8) ethics violations (seven (7) employees and one (1) alderman); one  (1) case withdrawn (the employee terminated City service on 12/30/2016); three (3)  cases waived (one (1) whose status was in progress, and one (1) new employee, and  one (1) new part-time employee with technical issues). No fines were imposed.   Staff also reported that, on January 11, 2017, the Board’s Executive Director received a  letter from the alderman who had not timely completed the training, and the letter  asserted defenses.  However, the Board, having discussed the validity of these  assertions in executive session, VOTED 4-0 (Nancy C. Andrade, Mary T. Carr and   B.   Other Cases                        Open Session Minutes  January 18, 2017  Page 8  Stephen W.

Case No. 17002.FIS, Statements of Financial Interests    The Board VOTED 4-0 (Nancy C. Andrade, Mary T. Carr and Stephen W. Beard, absent)  to direct staff to notify each of candidates for the Special Election for 4th Ward  alderman (to be held February 28, 2017) who had not yet filed Statements of Financial  Interests that they have until a date certain to file, and that, if they fail to file, the Board  will impose appropriate sanctions, including making public their names and violations  for failure to file.  8.  Case No. 17003.A, Money for Advice  In this case, the Board VOTED 4-0 (Nancy C. Andrade, Mary T. Carr and Stephen W.  Beard, absent) to direct staff to prepare an advisory opinion for the February meeting  advising an alderman and a City council employee that: (i) “City council employees,”  meaning persons paid by contract to perform services for aldermen or their ward  offices, are subject to the Ordinance’s Substantive Code of Conduct (Article II) as  though they are “employees”; (ii) discusses the restrictions the Ordinance places on  City employees or officials who would be the beneficiaries of GoFundMe campaigns;  and (iii) advises aldermen and department heads of best practices with respect to  monitoring their employees’ activities with respect to GoFundMe campaigns.    9.  Case No. 17004.A, Gifts    In this case, the Board VOTED 4-0 (Nancy C. Andrade, Mary T. Carr and Stephen W.  Beard, absent) to direct staff to prepare a written advisory opinion addressing whether  and under what conditions a City employee whose close family member passed away  may receive money from a GoFundMe campaign for the employee and the employee’s  family’s benefit, and whether the employee could receive cash from a neighborhood  group, and under what conditions receipt of money might be acceptable.    10. Case No. 17005.LOB, Lobbying  In this case, the Board, having heard staff’s extensive report on potential unregistered  lobbying by an individual that took place for more than four (4) months, and the  procedural posture of the case, as well as potential penalties that the Board could  impose on the unregistered lobbyist as well as the client who retained that individual,  the Chair directed the staff to prepare revised probable cause notices to be considered  by the Board at a special meeting the following week so the Board could issue them,  and directed that Board members ascertain whether they would need to recuse  themselves due to a potential conflict, under Board Rule 2-5. (Nancy C. Andrade, Mary  T. Carr and Stephen W. Beard were absent from the meeting, and Zaid Abdul-Aleem  recused himself from discussion of this matter.)      At 5:50 p.m., the Board VOTED 4-0 (Nancy C. Andrade, Mary T. Carr and Stephen W. Beard, absent) to  adjourn the meeting.   bd-minutes-2-15-17-os-final

Bagaman ang Ebola outbreak ay isang humanitarian crisis sa West Africa, hindi  naglalagay ng makahulugang panganib sa mga mamamayan ng U.S. ang epidemya. Hindi madaling kumalat ang  Ebola virus. Ipinaliliwanag ng fact sheet na ito ang ilang mga pangunahing kaalaman tungkol sa karamdaman.     Ano ba ang Ebola?  Ang Ebola ay isang hemorrhagic fever virus na pakalat-kalat na lumabas simula sa unang pagkilala dito noong 1976 at  pinangalanan alinsunod sa isang ilog sa Democratic Republic of Congo sa Africa, kung saan ito unang kinilala. Natukoy  din ang virus sa mga kabag o paniki at mga primate. Nagdudulot ang Ebola ng malubhang karamdaman. Nasa pagitan ng  50 at 90% ng mga taong nahawahan ng virus ang namamatay.   Anu-ano ba ang mga sintomas?  Ang mga sintomas ng Ebola ay kinabibilangan ng: lagnat, pananakit ng ulo, pananakit ng kasukasuan at kalamnan,  panghihina, diyariya o pagtatae, pagsusuka, pananakit ng tiyan, kawalan ng ganang kumain at abnormal na pagdurugo.  Maaaring magkaroon ang ilang mga pasyente ng singaw, namumulang mga mata, sinok, ubo, pananakit ng lalamunan,  pananakit ng dibdib, kahirapan sa paghinga o paglunok o pagdurugo sa loob o sa labas ng katawan.   Ang mga sintomas ay pinakangkaraniwan nang nagsisimula 8-10 araw matapos makapitan ng Ebola virus nguni't  maaaring lumitaw nang kasing-aga ng 2 araw at hanggang sa 21 araw pagkatapos ng exposure o pagkalantad.   Paano ba kumakalat ang Ebola ?  Ang Ebola virus ay kumakalat sa pamamagitan ng direktang pagkadikit sa dugo o iba pang mga likido mula sa katawan  (suka, tae, ihi, gatas sa dibdib, pawis, semilya) ng isang taong nahawahan na may mga sintomas o sa isang taong  kamakailan lang namatay dahil sa Ebola. Maaari din itong kumalat sa pamamagitan ng mga bagay (objects) o lugar  (surfaces) na kontaminado ng mga likido mula sa katawan ng isang taong nahawahan ng Ebola virus, halimbawa ay  damit o kumot. Hindi kumakalat ang Ebola sa pamamagitan ng hangin o ng tubig, o pagkain sa pangkalahatan.  Gayunpaman, sa Africa, maaaring kumalat ang Ebola bilang resulta ng paghawak ng bush meat (pangangaso ng mga  ligaw na hayop para kainin) at pagkadikit sa mga nahawahang kabag o paniki. Maaari din itong kumalat sa pamamagitan  ng pagkain ng isang hayop na nahawahan ng Ebola, kabilang mga kabag o paniki.    Ang isang taong nahawahan ng Ebola virus ay HINDI makapagpapasa nito sa ibang tao bago lumitaw ang anumang mga  sintomas.     Sino ba ang nanganganib sa Ebola?  Napakababa ng panganib para sa pangkalahatang publiko na mahawa ng Ebola. Ang mga healthcare provider o mga  miyembro ng pamilya na nangangalaga sa mga pasyenteng nahawahan ng Ebola sa West Africa ang mas higit na  nangaganib dahil nadidikit sila sa dugo o iba pang mga likido mula sa katawan.    Ano bang gamot ang mayroon?  Walang lisensiyadong gamot o bakuna para sa sakit na Ebola virus, bagaman sumasailalim sa pagsisiyasat ang dalawa.  Ang gamot para sa Ebola ay pagsuporta ng mga intravenous fluid, pagme-maintain ng blood pressure at oxygenation at  paggamot sa mga karagdagang impeksiyon kung mayroon.    Paano ko ba mapangangalagaan ang sarili ko?  Iwasan ang mga hindi kinakailangang paglalakbay sa mga apektadong lugar ng outbreak ng sakit na Ebola virus. Kung  nasa isang apektadong lugar ka:   •  Iwasang madikit sa dugo at likido mula sa katawan ng isang taong may karamdaman.  •  Huwag hahawak ng mga bagay na nadikit sa dugo o likido mula sa katawan ng isang taong nahawahan.  •  Gumamit ng protective clothing o pananggalang na kasuotan (mga guwantes, gown o damit na mahaba, maskara   at salamin sa mata) kapag nangangalaga sa mga taong may-sakit.   •  Bantayan ang kalusugan mo sa loob ng 21 araw pagkatapos lisanin ang apektadong lugar. Humanap kaagad ng   medikal na pangangalaga kung nakararanas ka ng mga sintomas ng Ebola.       Para sa higit pang impormasyon: http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola   10/2014

A plan of operation was presented to the Local Liquor Control Commission and it   was not approved.  On December 27, 2010, the applicant was advised by a letter from    Gregory Steadman, in his position as the Local Liquor Control Commissioner, that the   plan of operation submitted did not provide reasonable assurances that the issuance of the   liquor license would not have a deleterious impact on the surrounding community.   This   letter stated the primary concerns expressed by the community were that the issuance of   the license would adversely affect the surrounding neighborhood by an increase in traffic,   litter, noise and illegal consumption of alcohol by people on the public way.  Specifically,    it was noted the plan of operation did not address the community concern that the   issuance of a liquor license will increase commercial traffic from Walgreens that will be   routed westbound on Glenlake.  This would cause an increase of traffic, noise and safety   issues.          Subsequent to the filing of this appeal, the applicant was allowed to file an   amended plan of operation.  While there was no written amended denial letter addressing   this plan, testimony at the hearing established this amended plan of operation did not   satisfy the Local Liquor Control Commissioner that the issuance of this liquor license, at   this location, would not cause a deleterious impact on the surrounding community.           2      Since this is a denial of an application of a Packaged Goods license the issue   before this Commission is to determine de novo the propriety of that decision.  This   Commission must first determine if the City has met its burden that the issuance of the   license would cause a deleterious impact.  If the City does not meet that burden, the   denial would be reversed outright.  If the Commission determines that the City has met its   burden that the issuance of this license would cause a deleterious impact, the Commission   must then address if the decision that the proposed amended plan of operation did not   adequately address the issues causing the deleterious impact on the community.                A synopsis of the evidence will help understand this decision.    Debra Silverstein has been the Alderman of the 50th Ward since May of 2011.    Since then her focus has been working on cleaning up the neighborhood and working   with the police to try to get crime off the street.  She is familiar with the Walgreens   business that has applied for a license to sell packaged liquor goods at that location.  That   area is one of her ward’s hot spots.  There are a couple of buildings that are involved with   the Troubled Buildings Program.  There are gangs and drugs going on in that area, and it   is her belief that having a liquor store around the corner would enhance the negative   activity in that area.  She opposes a liquor license in that particular area because it is a   “hot spot area.”  Her opinion is based on the fact there are gang members and drug   dealing not too far away from the Walgreens.  Having the chance to buy liquor would   increase problems in that area.  There is also problems with garbage and littering in the   area.  There are also concerns from residents with added traffic going down on Glenlake.       3      Alderman Silverstein met with representatives of Walgreens a month before   testifying.  They were unable to satisfactorily address her concerns.          The Alderman stated she has put a moratorium on all packaged goods licenses in   the ward but that does not mean she is opposed to all such licenses.  The moratorium can   be lifted in two block areas with her approval.  She imposed the moratorium to have more   control as to how and under what circumstances liquor licenses are issued in the 50th   Ward.          She could not recall the exact date she met with the representatives of Walgreens.   Donovan Pepper and a Tom Murphy were at the meeting, as was some people from her   office.  The objections expressed were not as to Walgreens as a business entity, but with   this location.  She expressed her overall support for Walgreens and how it conducts   business in her ward.  She believes Walgreens to be a good corporate citizen and she   welcomes them in the 50th Ward.  She does believe that if Walgreens has packaged goods   its operation of business could possibly result in an increase in crime in her ward.  She   has not done any study or investigation to determine if Walgreens is a contributor to   crime in her ward.  She has found Walgreens to operate in compliance with City of   Chicago ordinances.  She feels safety cameras are a positive but those security cameras   do not go a few blocks away.  Her concern is what happens after consumers leave the   store.  She does not have the details about Walgreens’ proposed plan of operation that   would limit and impose certain restrictions on how and under what circumstances liquor   would be sold at this location.  She is not aware of any of Walgreens internal hiring      4   policies with regards to selling to eligible persons.  She reiterated her concerns are the   gang members not too far away and being able to get alcohol just two blocks away.  She   is aware that Walgreens has voluntarily opted not to carry low-end malt liquor, fortified   wines and single serving containers of that nature.            The Alderman repeated her position that this area should not have liquor at all.    She explained that at this moment this is a hot spot area with a lot of crime.  Until that is   cleared up, she does not want any establishment selling liquor.          She has not undertaken any type of traffic study to ascertain if the location of   Walgreens negatively impacted traffic flow.  The concerns about traffic are based on   what she is hearing from residents.  She did acknowledge the configuration of Walgreens   and its parking lot and curb cuts was reviewed and approved by the City, but added that   was without the alcohol.  She did not know what percentage of customers travel to   Walgreens in foot.  She does not know and does not feel it relevant to know the   anticipated overall percentage of sales of alcohol at this location if they were granted a   license.          Michael Lindberg has been a Chicago Police Officers in the 24th District for his   entire sixteen year career.  He is familiar with this Walgreens since his assignment on   foot patrol on Devon Avenue is approximately two blocks away.  He is at this hearing as   the representative of the 24th District.  He was asked to attend by the sergeant of   neighborhood relations.  The former Commander Michael Wick retired the day before      5   Lindberg’s testimony.  Lindberg testified he is worried about people buying 40 ounce   bottles or tall 20 ounce cans and going to the vacant lots across from Walgreens to drink   and litter.  His opinion would be affected to an extent if he found out Walgreens would   not sell 40 ounce bottles or twenty ounce cans.  He is also concerned for the potential for   homeless because you usually find homeless begging by places that sell liquor.          His concern about gang activity in the area deals with older gang members buying   alcohol and distributing it to minors.  He has noticed problems with the sale of drugs or   narcotics all around the area on the east side of Western.  He would give an opinion on   whether the license should or should not be issued but he does have concerns.          Officer Lindberg did not know if Commander Wick has voiced an objection to   this particular license.  He did not know who owned the unfenced vacant lots, but those   are a source of problematic crime and activity.  He does not know if the City of   Chicago’s Building Gang Unit has been directed to the vacant lot.  The officer admitted   he had no knowledge as to the products Walgreens intends to sell at this location and did   not review any of Walgreens’ policies with regard to the sale of alcohol.  He has not   reviewed the security system for this location and has not spoken to anyone who works at   this Walgreens store or any corporate representative of Walgreens.  Lindberg also stated   the Walgreens at this location is not affiliated with gang activity and he believes   Walgreens will call if gang members loiter in the parking lot.          6      Sadie Gerbic has lived at 6046 N. Campbell for sixteen years.  She has been   involved with the 5040 Neighbors Association, which was created due to the   development of the Walgreens property.  She also attends CAPS meetings and has had   block meetings at her home.  Her home is to the west and south of Walgreens.  She was   involved in obtaining petitions in opposition to Walgreens. Her concerns if a packaged   goods license is issued to Walgreens is increased litter and about the traffic flow onto   Glenlake into the residential area.  She hoped people coming from the business would not   go westbound through the neighborhood at increased speeds.  She has not noticed any   substantial increase in traffic on Glenlake since Walgreens opened, but is concerned she   will if liquor is sold at Walgreens.  She sees cars double parked by a liquor store at   Peterson and Maplewood.  There is concern with litter since she has seen a huge increase   in liquor bottles in black bags in her alley.  She feels it is more appropriate for liquor to   be sold in commercial areas, not in residential areas.  She started collecting the petitions   in August of 2009, and she and others obtained about 200 signatures.  She attended an   initial zoning meeting but had mailed the petitions to Walgreens and others.  The issue at   that was whether to permit Walgreens to build a drive-thru because that was a zoning   change.  That zoning change and drive-thru was subsequently approved.  She is   concerned about litter, traffic safety and an acceleration of drinking.          The petitions were circulated with respect to a matter before the Zoning Board of   Appeals and were circulated before the liquor license application was filed.  While the   increase in traffic has been minor, she opposes the license in part because of a concern   that a liquor license might lead to an increase in vehicular traffic proceeding westbound       7   concerns.  People are also drinking and having sex in cars.  The traffic situation at the   new Walgreens is very dangerous because of traffic coming from the new parking lot and   the old parking lot is for the old Walgreens directly across the street.  People are trying to   make the light at Granville and Western and cut each other off.  She does feel the   configuration of the Walgreens parking lot is dangerous.  She does not know about the   formal plan of operation presented by Walgreens but did read it would sell only beer and   wine.  The source of most alcoholic beverage related issues is Peterson’s Liquors at   Maplewood and Peterson.          Anastasia Glapan has lived at 2601 West Farwell for the last twenty years.  That   is about seven blocks north of this Walgreens.  She is concerned about the issuance of a   license at this location due to the gang bangers in the area.  The older gang members buy   alcohol for the youngsters.  It is a safety concern.  Additional trash and littering are also   concerns.  She admitted she is not aware of Walgreens’ policies of the sale of alcohol or   security policies at this location, or how employees are trained to ensure proper   identification is shown before alcohol is sold.  She agreed she is opposed to any   additional licenses being issued at or near her home at this time.  The problem is that   Walgreens does not take responsibility once the liquor is sold and it is off their premises.    It then becomes the community’s problem.  She is not aware of any proposed plan of   operation.           Debra Sidock has lived in the neighborhood for twenty years and is temporarily   living at 2639 West Ainslie.  She is planning to return to this neighborhood.  She opposes      10

In late July, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin  preliminary construction work around Schubert and Hamlin. Following, in mid-September,  the Department of Water Management’s crews will begin work to install a new sewer main  in W. Schubert Avenue (Hamlin-Monticello). The old sewer dates back to 1904 and needs to  be replaced.      When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will  be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    31st Ward Office: 773-278-0031    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner

Quirk, absent) to approve the Open Session Minutes of the August 18, 2010 meeting.   II.  Chair’s Report  None.   III.  Executive Director’s Report       A.  Education–Classes  We have resolved the glitches in the mandatory 4 year education notification system. There are currently 25 persons scheduled for class on September 23, 32 on October 7, 34 on October 21, and 39 on November 4.     On  September  1,  staff  presented  a  90  minute  session  to  all  21  employees  of  the Office of Compliance, at the request of its Acting Executive Director.  On September 13, staff presented a 45 minute session to the 9 Commissioners of the Old Town Park SSA, and 2 employees of its Service Provider, at the request of the Chair of that Commission.  On September 20, staff will again make a 25 minute presentation at New Employee Orientation.  About 60 employees are scheduled to attend.  On September 24, staff will present the third of 4 classes to about 225 Department of Aviation contractors at O’Hare, at the request of the Commissioner of Aviation.  Open Session Minutes September 15, 2010 Page 2  B.  Education–Mandatory Annual Ethics Education  I’m pleased to announce that, to date, we are at 71% compliance City-wide with the 2010  all-employee  online  training:  33,673  employees  scheduled,  and  23,844 completions. 6 of 50 aldermen have completed their training to date.  As to lobbyist training, to date, 75 lobbyists have completed the program–about 13% of the expected total.  C.  Statements of Financial Interests  To date, there remain 17 employees and 8 appointed officials who have yet to file their 2010 forms as required by law.  We are at 99% compliance.  There will be more on these individuals in closed session.  To date in 2010, the office has collected $11,680 late filing fees.  Staff is working diligently on the on-line filing, retrieval, and data processing system for Statements of Financial Interests. The project is now well into the user testing phase.    We are making arrangements to post on our website the filed 2010 Statements as well, and expect this to be accomplished in the next month.  D.  Lobbyist Registration  There are currently 547 lobbyists that have registered with the City for this year.  To date,  $272,775.00  in  lobbyist  registration  fees  have  been  deposited  with  the Department of Revenue.  July 20, was the deadline for lobbyists to file their semi-annual activity reports.  To date, we have received approximately 85% of these reports. In accordance with the Ordinance, staff will send out any and all required delinquency notices to lobbyists.  E.  Illinois Freedom of Information Act  Since  the  last  regularly  scheduled  Board  meeting,  the  office  has  received  1  new request  under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act:  for  6  lobbyists’  filings  for  years varying within ranges from 2003-2010, resulting in production of 36 records and copying of 2 of the pages from those records.  Open Session Minutes September 15, 2010 Page 3  F.  2011 Budget  The Board submitted its budget request in early August, and met with officials from the Budget Office on August 25.  There will be more on this in closed session.  G.  Candidates  Given the large number of candidates who have declared and are likely to declare their  candidacy  for  elected  City  Office,  staff  has  posted  detailed  information regarding the Campaign Financing Ordinance on the Board’s  website, and delivered 550 Candidate’s packets to the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, whose personnel distribute them to candidates and their representatives.  To date, we have received only 3 filed forms, plus one request for an extension.  All these forms are open for public inspection as well.  IV. Old Business  None.  V.  New Business  H.  Employee  Compensation  Level  for  Requirement  to  File  Statement  of Financial Interests in 2010  The  Board  reviewed  staff’s  recommendation  regarding  the  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance-mandated increase in the rate requiring employee filing of a Statement of Financial  Interests  with  the  Board.  The  Board  VOTED  4-0  (Michael  F.  Quirk, absent) to approve the staff recommendation: the 2011 rate is $79,300.00.  I.  Semi-Annual Review of the Confidentiality of Executive Session Minutes Under the Illinois Open Meetings Act  It was announced that, during the executive session, Board members would conduct the semi-annual review of Board executive session minutes as required by the Illinois Open Meetings Act, and would reconvene in open session to confirm the Board’s determination in executive session.  Open Session Minutes September 15, 2010 Page 4  J.  Public Notice of 2011 Board of Ethics Meeting Schedule  The Board considered staff’s proposed 2011 schedule of regularly-scheduled Board of  Ethics  meetings.    The  Board  then  VOTED  4-0  (Michael  F.  Quirk,  absent)  to approve the staff recommendation as follows:  Wednesday, January 19 Wednesday, February 16 Wednesday, March 16 Wednesday, April 13 Wednesday, May 18 Wednesday, June 15  Wednesday, July 20 Wednesday, August 17 Wednesday, September 14 Wednesday, October 19 Wednesday, November 16 Wednesday, December 14  All meetings will be held at 3:00 p.m. at the Board of Ethics, 740 North Sedgwick, Suite 500, Chicago, Illinois 60654.  K.  Posting Candidates Statement of Financial Interests Forms  The Executive Director discussed the idea of posting on the Board’s web site all Candidates’ Statements of Financial Interests filed with the Board, in the interest of greater  transparency  (and  given  that  the  agency  can  do  this  itself).    After  brief discussion, the Board’s consensus is that this is a good idea, but would like to discuss the idea in greater detail at the October meeting to set protocols for posting.  The Board VOTED 4-0 (Michael F. Quirk, absent) to adjourn into Executive Session at 3:21 p.m. to review matters concerning the conduct of employees and officials of the City that could result in their  discipline  or  dismissal,  to  review  questions  concerning  matters  of  professional  ethics  and performance, to review matters in which litigation is ongoing, and/or to review matters in which the Board finds that litigation against or affecting the Board is probable or imminent.  VI. New Business (Reconvened)  L.  Semi-annual Review of the Confidentiality of Executive Session Minutes under the Illinois Open Meetings Act.  At 4:49 p.m. the Board reconvened in open session to confirm its poll in Executive Session on the confidentiality of the Executive Session Minutes.  The Board VOTED 4-0 (Michael F. Quirk, absent) to confirm that the Executive Session Minutes of the Board from August 1987 to September 2010 remain confidential, on the ground that the need for confidentiality still exists as to those minutes, with the exception of those that have already been made publicly available by vote of the Board.  The Board VOTED 4-0 (Michael F. Quirk, absent) to adjourn.  bd-10-27-10.os.wpd

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,837 feet of 16-inch water main in W. 51st Street, S. Wallace  Street to S. Shields Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Dowell’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                              CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                51ST ST. WATER PROJECT  PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,837 feet of 16-inch  water main in W. 51st Street, S. Wallace Street to S. Shields Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of an 8-inch water main and we want to expand capacity.  Further, the old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by late May 2013. Restoration (to be completed by the Norfolk Southern  Railway Company) will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If  there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. 51st Street outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN PAT DOWELL    773- 373-9273                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main installation is slated to conclude in  late May 2013. Restoration (to be completed by the Norfolk Southern Railway Company) will  follow. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors  like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

By mid March 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark  Construction Company crews will begin the work to install 1,718 feet of new 8-inch water  main in N. Trumbull Avenue, from W. Grand Avenue to 160 feet north of W. Chicago  Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1901, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter  your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311   •  27th Ward Office: 312-432-1995  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for at least 5  minutes.  The aerator screens located at the tip of your faucets should be removed prior to  flushing.    This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, or any  lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line as a  result of the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your  water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.   It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes, if it has been idle or stagnant for  more than 6-hours.   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.     Sincerely,    Thomas Powers  Commissioner

This advisory opinion is based on the hypothetical facts presented by staff, and its application is limited to those facts.      FACTS:    Staff presents two sets of hypothetical facts:   Hypothetical  One.    A  City  employee  or  official  sits  as  a  member  of  a  City agency, board or commission.   During the course of a hearing conducted before that  body,  the  City official or employee examines a witness.  A vote, from which the employee or official recuses himself, is taken by the agency, board or commission at the conclusion of the hearing, resulting in a decision or action by that body.    Hypothetical  Two.    A    City  employee  or  official  sits  as  the  chair  of  a  City agency, board or commission.  The City official or employee presides over a hearing conducted before that body.  The City official examines no witnesses during  the  hearing.  A  vote,  from  which  the  employee  or  official  recuses himself, is taken by the agency, board or commission at the conclusion of the hearing, resulting in a decision or action by that body.    RELEVANT  ORDINANCE  PROVISIONS:  (Improper Influence) states:    Section  2-156-030(a)  No  official  or  employee  shall  make,  participate  in  making  or  in  any  way attempt  to  use  his  position  to  influence  any  City  governmental  decision  or action in which he knows or has reason to know that he has any economic interest  distinguishable  from  its  effect  on  the  public  generally  (emphasis added).  Section 2-156-080(a) (Conflicts of Interest) states:  No  official  or  employee  shall  make  or  participate  in  the  making  of  any governmental decision with respect to any matter in which he has any economic interest distinguishable from that of the general public  (emphasis added).  Case No.  00008.A April 20, 2000 Page 2    QUESTIONS PRESENTED:   1.   2.  Does a City employee or official participate in [the] making [of] a governmental decision, within the meaning of sections 2-156-030(a) and 2-156-080(a) of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance, if,  as a member of a City agency, board or commission, he examines a witness testifying during a hearing before that body which results in a decision or action by that body?   Does a City employee or official participate in [the] making [of] a governmental decision, within the meaning of sections 2-156-030(a) and 2-156-080(a) of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance, if he presides over a  hearing  before a City  agency, board or commission which results in a decision or action by that body?  BOARD PRECEDENT:  This is a case of first impression for the Board.  APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS: The phrase “participate in [the] making [of] a governmental decision” is not defined in the Governmental Ethics Ordinance.  Nor has the phrase been construed to date by Board opinion.  The  ordinary meaning of the word “participate” is “to join or share with others: take part.”  Webster’s II, New Riverside University Dictionary  (1984).  With  regard  to  the  first  question,  the  Board  notes  that  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  defines  the “examination” of a witness as “...the series of questions put to him by a party to the action, or his counsel, for the purpose of bringing before the  court...the knowledge which the witness has of the facts and matters in dispute, or of probing and sifting his evidence previously given.”  Black’s Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition, West (1979).  By virtue of the critical function an examination fulfills–the presentation and probing of evidence–the Board finds that “to examine a witness” during the course of a hearing, in one’s capacity as a member of the body before which that hearing is being conducted, is to “take part” in the hearing and, thereby,  in the ultimate decision made by that body, even if one does not “take part” in the vote.      As to the second question, the Board notes that Black’s Law Dictionary defines “preside” as “to occupy  the  place  of  authority  as  of  president,  chairman,  moderator,  etc.;  to  direct,  control  or regulate proceedings as chief officer, moderator, etc.; to possess or exercise authority....” Id.  By virtue  of  the  authority,  and  the  ability  to  direct  or  control,  inherent  in  the  position  of  one  who presides, the Board finds that “to preside” over a hearing is to “take part” in the hearing and, thereby, in the ultimate decision made by that body, even if one does not “take part” in the examination of witnesses or in the vote.        DETERMINATIONS:   Accordingly, the Board determines that:  Case No.  00008.A April 20, 2000 Page 3    1.  2.  a City employee or official participates in [the] making [of] a governmental decision, within the  meaning  of  sections  2-156-030(a)  and  2-156-080(a)  of  the  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance, if, as a member of a City agency, board or commission, he examines a witness testifying during a hearing before that body which results in a decision or action by that body; and   a City employee or official participates in [the] making [of] a governmental decision, within the  meaning  of  sections  2-156-030(a)  and  2-156-080(a)  of  the  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance, if he presides over a  hearing  before a City  agency, board or commission which results in a decision or action by that body.  Our determinations are not necessarily dispositive of all issues relevant to this situation, but are based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  Other laws or rules also may apply to this situation.  Be advised that City departments have  the  authority  to  adopt  and  enforce  rules  of  conduct  that  may  be  more  restrictive  than  the limitations imposed by the Ethics Ordinance.   RELIANCE:  This opinion may be relied upon by any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.  __________________ Darryl L.

I want to be certain  you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you  have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,320 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Lawndale  Avenue, from W. Cortland Street to W. Armitage Avenue, and in N. Monticello  Avenue, from W. Cortland Street to W. Armitage Avenue. The old main dates  back to 1887 and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Maldonado’s office, and he has made clear we  are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas H. Powers, P.E.   Commissioner       cc: Alderman Roberto Maldonado        26th Ward                                                       Do you wonder what was happening in 1887?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                                               Anne Sullivan began teaching 6 year old, blind and deaf Helen Keller.    Oregon became the first state to make Labor Day a holiday.    Britain celebrated the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.    Susanna Medora Salter was elected the first U.S. woman mayor (Argonia, Kansas).    The fire escape was patented.    Boris Karloff, an icon of horror cinema, was born.                    PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,320 feet of 8-inch water main in  N. Lawndale Avenue, from W. Cortland Street to W. Armitage Avenue, and in N. Monticello  Avenue, from W. Cortland Street to W. Armitage Avenue.           Reason: The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1887, and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Work starts in April, and we expect the job to be completed in late June (restoration  will follow in late July). This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected  developments in the street, or other circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our  schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Lawndale Avenue and N. Monticello Avenue  without interruption, but we will have to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS         24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   ALDERMAN ROBERTO MALDONADO   773-773-395-0143   3-1-1         312-742-1029   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June.  Restoration will follow in late July. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are  at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

H.   The Park District is a taxing district under the Act.   I.   The  Plan  contemplates  that  tax  increment  financing  assistance  would  be  provided for public improvements,  such  as  the  Project,  within,  or adjacent to,  the  boundaries  of  the Galewood/Armitage Redevelopment Area.   J.   DZLUP  wishes   the  Park  District  a  portion  of  the  Galewood/Armitage  Increment in  an  amount not to  exceed  $300,000  (the ""Project Assistance"")  for the purpose of funding the Project in the Park (the ""TIF-Funded Improvements"") to the extent  and in the manner provided in the Agreement (as hereinafter defined).   to  make  available  to   K.   In  accordance with  the Act,  the  TIF-Funded  Improvements shall  include  such  of  the  Park  District's  capital  costs  necessarily  incurred  or  to  be  incurred  in  furtherance  of  the  objectives  of the  Plan,  and the City has found that the TIF-Funded  Improvements consist of the  cost  of the  Park  District's  capital  improvements  that  are  necessary and  directly  result from  the  redevelopment  project constituting the  Project  and,  therefore,  constitute  ""taxing  districts'  capital  costs"" as defined in  Section 5/11-7 4.4-3(u) of the Act.   L.   The City and the  Park District wish to enter into this Agreement whereby the  City   shall pay for or reimburse the Park District for a portion of the TIF-Funded Improvements.   M.   On  March  18,  2009,  the  City  Council  adopted  an  ordinance  published  in  the  Journal  of  Proceedings  for  said  date  at  pages  55829  - 55846,  (the  ""Authorizing  Ordinance""),  among other things,  authorizing the execution of this Agreement.   N.   On  November 12,  2008,  the  Park  District's  Board  of Commissioners  adopted  an  order  expressing  its  desire  to  cooperate  with  the  City  in  the  construction  of the  Project  and  authorizing the execution of this Agreement (the ""Park District Ordinance"");   NOW,  THEREFORE,   in  consideration  of  the  mutual  covenants  and  agreements  contained  herein,  the  above  recitals  which  are  made  a contractual  part  of this  Agreement,  and  other  good  and  valuable  consideration  the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  are  hereby  acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:   TERMS AND CONDITIONS   SECTION  1.  THE PROJECT.   1.1.

The  Project  shall  at  a  minimum  meet  the  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Project  Description  in  Exhibit  8  hereof and  comply with  plans  and  specifications to  be  provided  to  and  approved  by  DZLUP  prior to  the  commencement  of the  Project  (""Plans  and  Specifications"")  in   2   order  for  the  Park  District  to  qualify  for  the  disbursement  of  Galewood/Armitage  Increment  funds.  No  material  deviation from  the  Plans  and  Specifications  may  be  made  without the  prior  written  approval of the  City.  The  Park District shall comply with  all  applicable federal,  state and  local laws,  statutes,  ordinances,  rules,  regulations,  codes  and  executive orders,  all as  may be  in  effect  from  time  to  time,  pertaining  to  or  affecting  the  Project  or  the  Park  District  as  related  thereto.   1.3.   At such time as the Park District lets a contract or contracts,  the form(s)  of which  shall  be  determined  solely  by  the  Park  District,  for  the  Project,  the  Park  District  shall  also  provide the City with copies,  if any shall apply,  of all governmental licenses and permits required  to  construct the  Project  and  to  use,  occupy  and  operate  the  Property  as  a public  park from  all  appropriate  governmental  authorities,  including  evidence  that  the  Property  is  appropriately  zoned to be  used,  occupied and operated as a public park.   1.4.   The  Park  District shall  include a certification of compliance with the  requirements  of Sections  1.1,  1.2,  and  1.3  hereof with  each  request for Galewood/Armitage  Increment funds  hereunder  and  at  the  time  the  Project  is  completed.  The  City  shall  be  entitled  to  rely  on  this  certification  without  further  inquiry.  Upon  the  City's  request,  the  Park  District  shall  provide  evidence satisfactory to the City of such  compliance.   SECTION 2.  FUNDING   2.1.   The  City  shall,  subject  to  the  Park  District's  satisfaction  of  the  conditions  precedent for disbursement described  in  this  Section  2 and  such  other conditions  contained  in  this  Agreement,  disburse  the  Project  Assistance  to  the  Park  District.  The  Park  District  shall  keep the Project Assistance in a segregated account to be used only for the  Project.   2.2.  Within  60  days  after the  Closing  Date  or  such  longer period  of time  as  may  be  agreed  to  by  the  Commissioner,  but  in  no  event  later than  90  days  after the  execution  of this  Agreement  (the  ""Satisfaction  Period""),  the  Park  District  must  satisfy  to  the  reasonable  satisfaction  of the Commissioner,  the following  conditions  precedent for the  City's disbursement  of the  Project Assistance to the Park District:   (a)   the  Park District has satisfactory title to the Property (which may be evidenced  by  an  acceptable  title  insurance  policy),  subject  only  to  those  title  exceptions  acceptable to the City and the  Park District; and   (b)   the Park District has provided or has caused to  be  provided to the City:   (i)   (ii)   copies of all  easements and encumbrances of record;   two  copies  of a Class  A  plat  survey  in  the  most  recently  revised  form  of  AL TA/ACSM  land  title  survey,  acceptable  in  form  and  content to  the  City  prepared  by  a surveyor  registered  in  the  State  of Illinois,  certified  to  the  Park  District,  and  certifying  as  to  whether  the  Property  is  in  an  area  identified  by  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  as  having  special flood  hazards;   (iii)   a copy  of the  most recent  real  estate tax bill  with  respect to  the  Property,  to the extent available;  and   3   (iv)   a  copy  of the  most  recent  water  bill  with  respect  to  the  Property,  to  the  extent available.   (c)   if the  Park  District  is  unable  to  satisfy  the  conditions  stated  in  this  Section  2.2  within  the  Satisfaction  Period,  either  Party  may  terminate  this  Agreement  by  providing written notice to the other Party.   2.3.   The  Park  District  may  request  that  a certificate(s)  of expenditure  in  the  form  of  Exhibit  C  hereto  (""Certificates  of  Expenditure"")  be  processed  and  executed  periodically.  The  City shall  not execute Certificates of Expenditure in the aggregate in  excess of the  actual  costs  of the  Project  that  are  TIF-Funded  Improvements.  Prior to  each  execution  of a  Certificate  of  Expenditure  by  the  City,  the  Park  District  shall  submit  documentation  regarding  the  applicable  expenditures to DZLUP.  Delivery by the  Park District to  DZLUP of any request for execution  by  the City of a Certificate of Expenditure hereunder shall,  in  addition to the items therein expressly  set forth,  constitute  a certification  to  the  City,  as  of the  date  of such  request for execution  of a  Certificate of Expenditure, that:   (a)   (b)   (c)   (d)   the  total  amount  of the  request  for the  Certificate  of Expenditure  represents  the  actual  amount payable to  (or paid to) the general contractor,  subcontractors,  and  other  parties  who  have  performed  work  on  or  otherwise  provided  goods  or  services in  connection with the Project,  and/or their payees;   all  amounts  shown  as  previous payments  on  the  current  request for a Certificate  of Expenditure have been  paid to the parties entitled to such  payment;   the Park District has approved all work and  materials for the current request for a  Certificate of Expenditure,  and such work and materials conform to the Plans and  Specifications previously approved by DZLUP;  and   the  Park  District is  in  compliance with  all  applicable federal,  state and  local  laws,  statutes,  ordinances,  rules,  regulations,  codes  and  executive  orders,  all  as  may  be  in  effect  from  time  to  time,  pertaining  to  or affecting  the  Project  or the  Park  District as  related thereto.   2.4.   The  City  shall  have  the  right,  in  its  discretion,  to  require  the  Park  District  to  submit further documentation as the  City may require  in  order to verify that the matters certified  to  in  Section  2.3  are  true  and  correct,  and  any execution  of a Certificate  of Expenditure  by the  City shall be subject to the City's review and approval of such documentation and its satisfaction  that  such  certifications  are  true  and  correct;  provided,  however,  that  nothing  in  this  sentence  shall be deemed to prevent the City from  relying  on  such certifications by the Park District.   2.5.   The current estimate of the cost of the Project is $490,000.  The Park District has  delivered to the Commissioner a project budget for the Project attached as  Exhibit D.  The  Park  District  certifies  that  it  has  identified  sources  of  funds  (including  the  Project  Assistance)  sufficient to  complete the  Project.  The  Park  District agrees that the  City will  only contribute the  Project Assistance  to  the  Project  and  that  all  costs  of completing  the  Project  over the  Project  Assistance  shall  be  the  sole  responsibility  of the  Park  District.  If the  Park  District at  any  point  does not have sufficient funds to complete the Project,  the Park District shall so notify the City in  writing,  and  the  Park  District  may  narrow  the  scope  of the  Project  (the  ""Revised  Project"")  as  agreed with the City in order to complete the Revised Project with the available funds.   4   2.6.   Exhibit  D contains  a  preliminary  list  of capital  improvements  and  other  costs,  if  any,  recognized  by  the  City  as  being  eligible  redevelopment  project  costs  under the  Act  with  respect  to  the  Project,  to  be  paid  for  out  of  the  Project  Assistance.  To  the  extent  the  TIF(cid:173) Funded  Improvements  are  included  as  taxing  district  capital  costs  under  the  Act,  the  Park  District  acknowledges  that  the  TIF-Funded  Improvements  are  costs  for  capital  improvements  and  the  City  acknowledges  it  has  determined  that  these  TIF-Funded  Improvements  are  necessary  and  directly  result  from  the  Plan.  Prior to  the  expenditure  of Project Assistance  on  ·the Project,  the  Commissioner,  based  upon the project budget,  may make such  modifications to  Exhibit D as  he  or she wishes  in  his or her discretion to  account for all  of the  Project Assistance  to  be  expended  under this  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that  all  TIF-Funded  Improvements  shall  (i)  qualify as  redevelopment project costs  under the Act,  (ii)  qualify as  eligible costs  under  the  Plan;  and  (iii)  be  improvements that the  Commissioner has agreed to  pay for out of Project  Assistance, subject to the terms of this Agreement.   2.7.   The  Park  District  hereby  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  City's  obligations  hereunder with  respect to  the  Project Assistance are  subject on  every respect to the  availability  of  funds  as  described  in  and  limited  by  this  Section  2. 7  and  Section  2.2.  If  no  funds  or  in  any  fiscal  period  of  the  City  for  insufficient  funds  are  appropriated  and  budgeted  disbursements  of the  Project Assistance,  then  the  City  will  notify the  Park  District  in  writing  of  that occurrence,  and the  City  may terminate this Agreement on  the earlier of the  last day of the  fiscal  period for which sufficient appropriation was made or whenever the funds appropriated for  disbursement under this Agreement are exhausted.   2.8.   If  the  aggregate  cost  of  the  Project  is  less  than  the  amount  of  the  Project  Assistance  contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  the  Park  District  shall  have  no  claim  to  the  difference  between  the  amount of the  Project Assistance  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and  the amount of the Project Assistance actually paid  by the City to the  Park District and expended  by the Park District on the Project.   SECTION 3.  TERM.   The term  of this Agreement shall commence on  the  Closing  Date and shall expire on the  date on  which  the  Galewood/Armitage  Industrial  Redevelopment Area  is  no  longer in  effect,  or  on  the date of termination of this Agreement according to its terms,  whichever occurs first.   SECTION 4.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.   4.1.   in   The  Chicago  Park  District  shall,   its  sole  discretion,  determine  if  any  environmental remediation  is  necessary,  and  any such work that the Park District determines is  necessary shall  be  performed  using  the  Project Assistance funding  provided  herein.  The  City's  financial  obligation  shall  be  limited  to  an  amount  not  to  exceed  $300,000  with  respect  to  the  matters  contained  in  this  Agreement,  including  this  Section  4.  The  City  makes  no  covenant,  representation  or warranty as to  the  environmental  condition  of the  Park or the suitability of the  Park as a park or for any use whatsoever.   4.2.   The  Park  District agrees to  carefully  inspect the  Park prior to  commencement of  any  remediation  or  development  on  the  Park  to  ensure  that  such  activity  shall  not  damage  surrounding property,  structures,  utility lines or any subsurface lines or cables.  The Park District  shall  be  solely  responsible  for the  safety  and  protection  of  the  public.  The  City  reserves  the  right to inspect the work being done on the Park.  The Park District agrees to keep the Park free   5   from  all  liens  and  encumbrances  ans1ng  out  of  any  work  performed,  materials  supplied  or  obligations incurred by or for the Park District.   4.3.

By mid-May, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 3,919 feet of  new 12-inch water main in W. Armitage Avenue, from N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Kedzie Avenue. The  old water main dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    26th Ward Office: 773-395-0143    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner      Genwmnot03032016

SOUTH SHORE DRIVE    BUILT:  ARCHITECT:    MEYER FRIDSTEIN    The Shoreland Hotel, completed in 1926 on the lakefront in Chicago’s Hyde Park    neighborhood, stands as one of the city’s largest and most prominent early-twentieth-century  apartment hotels.  Residential or “apartment” hotels like the Shoreland, which combined   elements of apartment and hotel living and could be tailored to accommodate working-,   middle-, and upper-class residents, emerged as a new urban residential building type in the late- nineteenth century and proliferated during the 1910s and 1920s in the city’s lakefront   neighborhoods. The Shoreland Hotel is a reflection of the rapid growth and expansion of the  city during the 1920s, when skyrocketing land values, advancing building technologies, and  shifting tastes regarding apartment living made apartment hotels a popular housing choice.  The thirteen-story, U-shaped Shoreland Hotel was designed by Meyer Fridstein with Spanish  Renaissance Revival style terra-cotta detailing.  The Shoreland’s sheer size, its composition,  and the quality of its overall design, which featured face brick and terra-cotta ornamentation on  all four elevations, served to distinguish the building from other luxury high-rise apartment ho- tels that rose along the lakefront in communities north and south of the city’s central business  district.  The Shoreland Hotel was a major center of Hyde Park social life during the first half of the  twentieth century.  During the fifty years that it served as a luxury apartment hotel, the   Shoreland hosted such famous (and infamous) individuals as Amelia Earhart, Eleanor Roose- velt, Al Capone, Jimmy Hoffa, and Elvis Presley.  The originally lavish public spaces on the  first and second floors—including a double-height lobby with mezzanine, opulent public and  private dining rooms, and a large ballroom—also served as meeting and event spaces for Hyde   1      Park social circles.  Situated at the entrance to the Hyde Park neighborhood just north of Jackson Park and facing  the lakefront across Promontory Point, the Shoreland Hotel is a distinctive visual presence on  the lakefront.  The Building was completed just as the last stages of the city’s massive South  Park Development plans were being implemented, and the owners and operators of the   Shoreland viewed their hotel as an integral part of the improvements along Hyde Park’s shore- line.         BUILDING DESCRIPTION AND DEVELOPMENT HISTORY  The Shoreland Hotel is a thirteen-story steel-frame structure, roughly 187 feet by 300 feet, with  a masonry exterior and a flat roof with crenellated center mechanical penthouse.  The building  has a U-shaped configuration formed by a main block with angled north and south projecting  wings that flare to form a landscaped forecourt with a prominent circular drive and ornamental  cast-iron porte-cochere.  The entire building is faced with buff-colored Kittanning brick and  architectural glazed terra cotta produced by the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company.    The Shoreland faces east onto South Shore Drive, and is flanked on the north by a circa-1920s  L-shaped apartment building and on the south by the Jackson Shore Apartments, a luxury   apartment building that was designed by Rapp & Rapp and built by G. H. Gottschlack &   Company in 1917.  Promontory Point (completed in the late 1930s) is directly east of the   building across Lake Shore Drive.  Located approximately three blocks directly south, the Mu- seum of Science and Industry marks the northern end of Jackson Park.   Like most tall buildings in Chicago dating from the early-twentieth century, the Shoreland’s  facades are divided into three distinct parts—a substantial two-story terra-cotta base, a   minimally detailed, regularly fenestrated mid-section, and an elaborately decorated two-story  top.  The building is designed in an exuberant Spanish Renaissance Revival style, with an ar- caded base featuring double-height window openings with tri-foil cusped arches and terra-cotta  detailing, including heraldic shields, eagles, keystones with satyr heads, and other fanciful  touches.  At the center portion of the building, the two-story base projects outward to accommo- date an open terrace above, which is bordered by a terra-cotta balustrade decorated with the  Shoreland’s logo—a Spanish galleon ship at full mast—flanked by torchieres.  The ship motif  appears again along the top of the building, forming the center of two massive multi-colored  terra-cotta cartouches that decorate the two projecting towers.  Ornamentation at the top section  of the building includes terra-cotta arcades of cusped arches framing the eleventh-story win- dows, cornices topped with red terra-cotta roof tiles, and attic stories above the cornice-line that  feature baroque center sections. This upper-level terra-cotta detailing continues along all four  elevations.    On the interior, the building features a grand double-height lobby space measuring forty-seven  feet wide and 125 feet long.  Originally decorated in the Spanish Renaissance Revival  architectural style, the space was renovated in the 1930s in the much more streamlined Moderne  style, with all of the ornate detailing removed at that time.  North of the lobby is the classically- inspired Louis XVI Room, which served as the hotel’s main dining room.   The walls were  decorated with classical plaster detailing, including paired fluted Ionic pilasters supporting an   2      The Shoreland Hotel is a thirteen-story steel-frame masonry structure with a U-shaped   configuration formed by a main block with projecting end wings that form a landscaped forecourt.

Warren, who was best known for his hotel  designs. The ten-story Virginia Hotel (1888, demolished) was built for Leander McCormick at  Rush and Ohio Streets in an exclusive near-north-side residential district.  The ten-story   Lexington (1891, demolished) was built near Prairie Avenue to house the wealthiest class of  visitors to the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893.  These nineteenth-century luxury   apartment buildings were among the first in Chicago to combine “the status and services of a  hotel” with the premium location of the city’s best residential areas.  Because of the continued  resistance from among Chicago’s elite to the idea of apartment houses, however, these   buildings remained few and far between.  A nation-wide depression in1893 brought construction in Chicago to a standstill despite the  success of the World’s Columbian Exposition.  When full-scale building activity resumed  around the turn of the century, architects and builders had developed a set of norms for tall  apartment buildings that combined the classical architectural influence of the “White City” with  well-planned, efficient interiors.  These reforms, coupled with rapidly rising land values and the  increasing costs of keeping servants to care for a sprawling private home and grounds, finally  brought widespread acceptance to apartment living.  At this time, the residential or “apartment”  hotel emerged as a clearly defined and distinctive building type, a calculated combination of  apartment and hotel that offered the amenities, services, and public spaces of the best of   Chicago’s hotels to permanent residents who desired all of the comforts of home without the  responsibility.  A 1920s marketing brochure entitled “Apartment Hotels” succinctly outlined the  benefits of the new arrangement:   In an apartment hotel a family can live as comfortably in a five- or six-room  apartment as they can in a very large private residence…The mistress of the  home…has her problems simplified. She is not bothered with servants, coal bills,  janitors, repairs and a thousand and one other vexing problems, with which the  housewife is familiar, and…a community residence is less expensive than an in- dividual residence.   The post-depression building boom, which continued with little interruption until the Great   Depression hit in 1930, produced many of the best luxury apartment hotels in Chicago.    Architects and builders responded to changes in lifestyle that de-emphasized family-oriented  living and constructed buildings that were specifically designed to cater to distinctive social  groups.  Apartment hotels that offered smaller private rooms but which were close to the  beaches and offered dining, dancing, and proximity to nightlife and public transportation were  specifically targeted to young professionals.  Other apartment hotels were designed for a more  prosperous and established clientele, with large, well-appointed private suites, exceptional   service, and refined dining and entertainment spaces.  In either case, as architectural historian  Paul Groth points out in Living Downtown: The History of Residential Hotels in the United  States, the apartment hotel allowed its residents to have their privacy when they wanted it, but it  also offered the type of “gregarious existence not possible in private houses” because “grand  hotels were built for crowds and hotel life was spectacularly and notoriously public.”  The most imposing apartment hotels constructed between 1910 and 1930 were concentrated  along the affluent lakefront neighborhoods north and south of the city’s central business   districts.  On the north side, the fashionable communities of the Near North Side, Lincoln Park,   13

Avenue O, from E. 106th Street to E. 108th Street.      Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further,  the old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late July 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Avenue O outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in  place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours.  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we  can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                          ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   ALDERMAN JOHN POPE   773-721-1999   312-742-1021            FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If  you have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also  call Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the  voicemail message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside  of our working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the  workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the  services from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour  notice when this is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old  pipe will break.  They can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If  we do this, we will let you know what is happening, even though we may be unable to  give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be  good neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By  working together, we can complete this important project as friends working for the  improvement of our community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your  neighbors to reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective  response as the only strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood  basis to work with us on practical steps (public and private) to protect your  property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters  to monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for  only the water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while  protecting one of our most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This  means that with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their  water bills.      Homeowner Incentives         Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:   A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the   meter had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit  www.metersave.org, call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account  number ready.  Space is limited based on funding availability and the number of  volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter  complete with the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of  charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to  Water Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1   place inside the home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount  of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this  limited time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise,  Water Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the  sustainability of our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500  gallons per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household  water consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water  consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This  saves 25 gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers  typically use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in  the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use  by 20-50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use  thousands of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save  money and water by preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45  million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could  face severe water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the  Chicago Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water  from Lake Michigan.               Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!

Frank Baum wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.    The first electric bus became operational in New York City.    English handwriting experts established the art of calligraphy.         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  After our private contractor installs a new tumbling basin at 61st Street/St. Louis, the  Department of Water Management will be installing a new sewer main in W. 61st Street, from  S. St. Louis Avenue to S. Central Park Avenue. Then, the contractor will install a new sewer  main in S. Central Park Avenue, from W. 61st Street to W. 61st Place.       Reason:  The old pipe dates back to around 1900 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded  by W. 60th Street on the north, W. 63rd Street on the south, S. St. Louis Avenue on the east, and  S. Hamlin Avenue on the west benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work by the contractor at 61st Street/St. Louis will commence in mid-January, with  completion anticipated for mid-February. Installation of the new sewer in 61st Street will start in  mid-February, and end in mid-March. Installation of the new sewer in Central Park will begin  in late March, with completion anticipated for mid April. Restoration of the damaged  streets/parkways will follow (mid April to mid May). Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working  hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1            ALDERMAN TONI FOULKES   773-863-0220            ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it  is.  Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of  digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will  pave the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and  curb at least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City  of Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce  the risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are  aware that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Foulkes,  and others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.

The park’s exceptional foot traffic, Michigan Avenue location and state-of-the-art  sound system will bring a fresh way to enjoy a classic event.      As one of Chicago’s top destinations, Millennium Park is undeniably one of the most sought-after  venues for brands to reach a cross-section of consumers, from Chicagoans representing the city’s 77  neighborhoods, suburban families and a significant presence of international visitors.  Growing  interest has resulted in more onsite promotional opportunities throughout the year.     Last year’s inaugural Millennium Park Film & Music Series was a resounding success but partners  requested separate series to attract targeted audiences. We heard you!  Now brands can choose  between the Millennium Park Film Series or Millennium Park Music Series to better align their  brand/activation.   The Series Sponsorship package at Lake FX Creative-Con offers an opportunity for genuine brand  integration.  In addition to standard promotional benefits, partners can develop their own panel  discussion or workshop that targets Chicago’s arts & creative community.     A dance competition like no other, SummerDance-off will host four competitions in the park – two  footwork competitions and two steppin’ competitions.     These battles will each lead to one winner who will go on to a winner-take-all show at Millennium  Park on August 26th.    The Chicago City Markets packages the City’s markets under one umbrella. By combining the  resources of the popular Chicago Farmers Markets, Community Markets and Maxwell Street Market,  we can extend brand exposure across several locations throughout the year.

Register now at www.cdphlms.com   Figure 1. Weekly reported percent of emergency department visits  attributed to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current  season (2010-2011) and previous season, October-May.   What is the risk?  The risk of influenza infection in Chicago is low.  Locally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza is  less than one percent, one of the lowest levels seen all season with only one specimen testing positive for influenza A.    This is the second consecutive week since December that no influenza B viruses were detected.  The influenza vaccine  protects against both influenza A and B.  Vaccine is available in doctor’s offices, retail pharmacies, CDPH Neighbor- hood Health Centers, and immunization walk-in clinics.  A list of CDPH clinics is available on the City of Chicago  website1 and by calling 311.  The last Chicago Flu Update of the 2010-2011 influenza surveillance season will be is- sued on 5/27/2011.  CDPH will continue to conduct influenza surveillance throughout the summer.  Updates will re- sume in October 2011 for the 2011-2012 season.     Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   No influenza-associated ICU admissions was re- ported for surveillance week 19 (May 8-14, 2011).   This is the third consecutive week where no ICU  admissions were reported.  Since October, a total of  98 influenza-associated ICU admissions of Chicago  residents have been reported to CDPH.2  No deaths  were reported for surveillance week 19.  A total of  fifteen deaths have been reported so far this season  (both ICU and non-ICU) including two in pediatric  patients.       How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   For the week of May 8-14, 2011, with 17 hospitals  reporting, 3.6% of emergency room visits were due  to ILI (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with cough or  sore throat). This is similar to levels reported during  the same surveillance week in 2010 and the third  consecutive week that a decrease has been noted  (Figure 1).         Which influenza strains are circulating?   With 7 laboratories reporting, 1 (<1%) of 207 speci- mens tested was positive for influenza in week 19,  subtyped as influenza A (H1N1).  No specimens  tested positive for influenza B (Figure 2).    Where can I get more information?        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  FluView3 report provides national updates and  trends related to the intensity of influenza activity  across the United States, as well as detailed infor- mation on antiviral resistance, severity of illness,  and other topics. Updates specific to Illinois4 and  Suburban Cook County5 are also available online.     1http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/clinic/svcs/find_a_clinic.html  2 https://www.chicagohan.org/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=28960&folderId=24344&name=DLFE-144.pdf   3http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/; 4 http://www.idph.state.il.us/flu/fluupdate10-11.htm  5 http://www.cookcountypublichealth.org/flu_current_situation   Figure 2.

Jamal Bunni, President   Applicant (Package Goods)  for the premises located at   2353 North Narragansett Avenue             v.                                              Local Liquor Control Commission     Department of Business Affairs & Licensing   Mary Lou Eisenhauer, Acting Director                ORDER    CHAIRMAN FLEMING=S OPINION JOINED BY COMMISSIONER SCHNORF     The applicant applied for a Packaged Goods liquor license for the premises located at   2353 N. Narragansett.  After an investigation was conducted, Mary Lou Eisenhauer, then the   Acting Director of the Local Liquor Control Commission, denied the application on August 15,   2008.  The reason for the denial was her determination that the issuance of this license would   violate Section 4-60-090 (a) of the Municipal Code which states:    No license for the sale of alcoholic liquor shall be   shall be issued to any person, partnership, association  or corporation for the sale or dispensing at retail of   alcoholic liquor on any premises used as a filling station.                                 1   A timely appeal of this decision was filed at the License Appeal Commission.  This   matter proceeded to hearing on December 3, 2008, and was taken under advisement.       Bryan Knipper testified that he was the Senior Business Consultant for the Department of   Business Affairs and Licensing that handled this application.  He recommended that the package   goods license be denied.  He made this recommendation in part based on his review of the   License Application Investigative Summary, in evidence as Applicant=s Exhibit #1, which stated   the business is occupying part of a Citgo gas station.  Other factors considered on this denial   included the fact that the location of this business and the Citgo station were part of a singular   standing building on the same tract of land, lack of separate parking and the fact that gas pumps   were in front of the premises proposed to be used for the package goods store.  He stated he   agreed with the memo prepared by James Terrell, Applicant=s Exhibit #3.  That memo stated the   application should be denied because the applicant was Aattempting to open a business selling   liquor within a free standing building that was clearly constituted as a filling station and is in fact   currently operating as a filling station.  Changing the address and putting up an interior wall is   merely attempting to squirt the intent of the law to keep the sale of liquor products away from   the proximity of servicing motor vehicles.@      Jamal Bunni is the owner of 50% of MGDN Enterprises.  He owns the property located at   Fullerton and Narragansett.  The applicant=s corporation which was created on May of 2007, has   a two year lease for a portion of the property at Narragansett and Fullerton.  A separate    corporation has a lease for the portion of the property occupied by Citgo and has a franchise                       2   agreement with Citgo.  The building was originally empty space that was to be used as a Medical   Center.  It was remodeled for use by Citgo and Citgo painted this entire building.  Later, the area   where the packaged goods would be sold was built out with a wall separating it from Citgo at a   cost of $150,000.  The wall was built to allow for the sale of alcohol and permits were obtained   for the work.  His intent was to comply with the Municipal Ordinances.      The geographical layout of the site is not in dispute.  There is a Citgo station from a   portion of the building.  Apparently at one time it controlled the entire building.  A license to sell   liquor would not issue to any entity operating the Citgo station since those premises are being   used as a filling station.  The present layout contains two storefronts.  One is for the operation of   the Citgo station and mini-mart and one is the proposed site of a packaged goods location.    Presently there is a wall dividing these two storefronts and there are separate leases for each   storefront.  While there was testimony that the gas pumps from the Citgo station are in front of   the proposed site of the packaged goods store, the pictures seem to indicate that is not the fact.        This case comes down to this Commission=s definition of the word premises.  Merriam-   Webster gives two definitions of the word as related to this issue.  They are:    A.   B.   A tract of land with the buildings thereon    A building or part of a building usually with its appurtenances.    If one applies definition A, the license should be denied since the tract of land includes a portion   of a building used as a filling station.  If one applies definition B, the restriction on the license   would not apply since one would focus on the use of the specific part of the building.                        3   Under the specific evidence produced in this case, it is the decision of this Commissioner   that it is appropriate to use definition B.  There are two separate premises existing in the building   at Fullerton and Narragansett.  The premises in which packaged liquor goods would be sold are   not being used by a filling station.  The prohibition set out in Section 4-60-070(a) of the   Municipal Code does not apply to those premises.  The decision of the Local Liquor Control   Commission denying the issuance of a package goods license to MGDN Enterprise, Ltd. for the   premises located at 2353 North Narragansett Avenue is reversed.       COMMISSIONER KOPPEL=S CONCURRING OPINION    This Commissioner concurs with Chairman Fleming=s decision.  It is quite clear that the   area where the packaged goods liquor license would be sold is separate from the Citgo station.    They are definitely two different and separate operations and storefronts.  The license should be   granted.                                                    4   THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED That the said order or action of the Local      Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago be and the same hereby is REVERSED.     Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a Petition for Rehearing may be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order  is deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the  Circuit Court, the Petition for Rehearing must be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days  after service of this order as such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

6980`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/lac/2010lacrulings/10LA05.pdf`Success`Success`24`10`Not a fillable PDF.`On March 24, 2010, Local Liquor Control Commissioner Gregory Steadman issued an   amended denial letter.  That amended denial letter incorporated the original law enforcement   basis for denial and also alleged the application was denied because the applicant has been   charged with committing a battery, with failure to cooperate with the police on November 29,   2009, concerning the battery investigation and with a happy hour violation committed on   February 10, 2010.  These charges are pending before the Local Liquor Control Commission in   case 10 LR 13.       Since this is a denial of an application the issue before this Commission is to determine   de novo the propriety of the denial of this incidental activity application for a license at this   address.  In order to better understand this decision, a summary of the proceedings which   consists of over 378 pages of transcript and over 27 exhibits is appropriate.       Prior to the start of evidence the City was given leave to amend the amended denial letter   to reflect that the date of the alleged battery was September 7, 2009.  This document is in   evidence as City’s Exhibit 8.  City’s Exhibits 1 through 7 were allowed in evidence as the    documents relied on by Norma Reyes and Gregory Steadman when they made their decision to   deny this application.       Mr. Maragos made a request that this Commission enter a pre-hearing order striking   portions of the amended denial letter referencing the Commission of a battery by the applicant as   a basis for denial.  This request was made on the basis that the criminal charges were disposed of                       2   favorably in Circuit Court.  The request was denied.        Also, prior to the start of evidence the parties entered into a stipulation that the Ole   Lounge at 2812 N. Lincoln Avenue has no prior disciplinary history since its inception in 2006,    aside from the charges pending under Case 10 LR 13.      Thomas Jenkins has been a Chicago Police Officer for eleven years and is presently a   tactical officer in the 19th District.  In late 2009, District Commander Kenny assigned him to   conduct a liquor license investigation regarding Tolgano, Inc., at 1834 West Montrose Avenue.    At the end of his investigation he recommended that Commander Kenny not authorize the liquor   license.  As part of his investigation he did a name check on Mitch Gundogdu and became aware   there was an investigative alert with probable to arrest for a battery sexual criminal assault.  An   investigative alert is issued by a detective and if the alert is with probable cause to arrest it   means a complaint has issued and the person will be arrested.  Jenkins called Mitch personally   and scheduled an appointment at the 19th District for November 28, 2009, at noon.  Mitch did not   appear for this meeting.  Jenkins called Mitch on November 29, and told him he needed to come   in.  Mitch replied he could not.  Jenkins told Mitch the liquor license application would not be   approved and Mitch said he did not care.  Mitch did say he wanted to send in a lawyer or a friend   but Jenkins insisted Mitch appear.  There were two conversations between Jenkins and Mitch   which Jenkins described as friendly, not hostile.  Jenkins felt that Mitch did not cooperate with   the investigation.  Jenkins was not involved in the eventual arrest of Mitch.                           3   On cross Officer Jenkins stated he was assigned this investigation by Commander Kenny   about November 25 or 26.  After Jenkins became aware of the investigative alert he contacted   Michele Wood who was the detective on the case who confirmed the investigative alert with   probable cause to arrest was still valid.  Jenkins did not know the investigative report was   initiated on September 26, 2009.  Detective Wood did not tell Jenkins what happened after the   investigative alert was issued and Jenkins was not aware if he was the first officer to speak to   Mitch.  He called Mitch on November 27 from a phone at the 19th District.  The number he   called from was (312) 744-5983.  Jenkins recalled Mitch said he would send a friend or lawyer   in but was not sure if Mitch said he had a partner.  Jenkins never contacted Mitch=s attorney prior   to writing his report that Mitch was uncooperative.  Jenkins acknowledged he had been trained in   the proper legal procedures involving criminal investigative alerts.  Jenkins also stated Mitch did   speak to him despite his Fifth Amendment rights.  Jenkins had done liquor license application   investigations for two years.  Jenkins initially went to the location of the applicant at 1834 W.   Montrose but it was papered up.  He did not ask anyone to open the door.  Jenkins stated he is   not aware of standard operating procedures for liquor license applications performed by the   Department of Revenue.  His investigation was an investigation for the district commander and   not done for the liquor commission.  He does not need to follow the Department of Revenue   procedures.  His was informal and he had Mitch pick the date and time for him to come in.  He   was doing a liquor license investigation for the district commander pursuant to the district   commander=s receipt of a letter from DBA about this application.  He is not involved in any   police investigation relative to revenue.  His investigations deal with calls for service and doing   name checks.  He deals only with police issues.  He is not aware of the rules and regulations of                       4   investigations before the DBA or the Department of Revenue.       Witnesses were taken out of order to expedite the proceedings.   This decision will   review the City=s case and then the defense witnesses.       John Kenny has been the 19th District Commander since March of 2008.  That district   includes 1834 W. Montrose Avenue.  His role in liquor license applications is to make a   recommendation of whether the license be approved or disapproved after he reviews the findings   of a member of his staff who has conducted a preliminary investigation.  He assigned Officer   Jenkins and Philbin  to investigate the application for 1834 W. Montrose Avenue. They   submitted a summary of their investigation to him on November 29, 2009.  Kenny reviewed that   summary and recommended the application be denied because the applicant failed to cooperate   in the preliminary investigation.  He identified City=s Exhibit 10, as a copy of his report created   on December 7, 2009.  Kenny is familiar with the Ole Lounge which is located within his district   at 2812 N. Lincoln.  He is aware Mr. Gundogdu is also the president of the Ole Lounge.  Kenny   is aware there had been an investigative alert issued regarding an incident that occurred at the   Ole Lounge.  Kenny is aware from Officer Jenkins’ report the Mr. Gundogdu did not appear at a   scheduled meeting with Officer Jenkins.  Kenny stated in his opinion the applicant did not   cooperate with the liquor license application process.  This lack of cooperation influenced his   decision to disapprove the application because it prevented his officers from doing a complete   investigation of the premises and the applicant.  Commander Kenny identified City=s Exhibit 11,   as a printout of calls to or from the address of 2812 N. Lincoln from January 1, 2009, and                       5   January 12, 2010.  It reflects 19 calls for service.  This includes five calls for batteries and two   calls for criminal sexual assault.       On cross Commander Kenny stated that his December 7, 2009, objection set out that Aat   this time,@ December 7, 2009, he disapproved of the application Adue to the fact that the owner   has an investigation No. 299961929.@  Kenny repeated that his disapproval was based on the   applicant=s refusal to come in to be interviewed.  The 19 calls for service was not a point of his   decision.  Kenny never stated in writing to anyone that Mitch Gundogdu Afailed to cooperate   with the police on this investigation alert.@  This was not his investigation.  His liquor license   report states either approve or denial and he attached the investigating officer=s report.  After   reviewing police reports Commander Kenny explained Police Officer Traci Tokarz wrote the   initial report but that the detectives from Area 3 would have done the investigation.  Kenny   never discussed this report with Officer Tocarz or Detective Wood.  The report from Officer   Jenkins indicated the applicant failed to come in for an investigative interview and that   constituted failure to cooperate.  Kenny indicated again the basis of his recommendation to   disapprove was a failure to cooperate with the liquor license investigation.  Kenny did not   consult with either Officer Jenkins or Philbin and did not consult with anyone as to what   constituted failure to cooperate.  Kenny was not aware that Mitch voluntarily submitted himself   with his attorney to be arrested and booked at the 19th District.  He is not aware of the disposition   of that case.            The City rested its case.                  6      Thomas Kamykowski is the Executive Director of the Ravenswood Chamber of   Commerce. That organization is located at 1756 W. Wilson which is about four blocks from the   applicant=s location.  The chamber has about 125 members and its purpose is to support   businesses in the Ravenswood community, to foster a reliable business environment in the area   and to try to contribute back to community.  It sponsors movies and concerts in the Chase Park   and holiday parties at local schools and parks.  The area around 1844 Wilson has gone through   hard times over the last couple of years.  The Brown Line AL@ station was closed for rehab for an   entire year and then there was a huge sinkhole.  There has also been street repair and seven   projects going on.  In the last six months their area has started to become very viable.  A   business like Wolcott=s would adhere to the changing character of that stretch of Montrose.  The   witness knows Mitch and Wolcott=s from stopping by to view the work going on.  The previous   site of Wolcott=s was an eyesore with employees getting into disputes with neighbors.  It was a   pizza place that disposed of grease improperly.  After the pizza business vacated the premises it   was vacant and attracted homeless people and marked by graffiti.  Wolcott=s would be an asset to   the community.  It would prevent crime in the neighborhood because it would conform to the   changing character of Montrose and would not be attracting the type of folks typically associated   with crime.  The witness identified Licensee=s Exhibit 1, as a letter he wrote in support of this   license.       On cross the witness stated he lives a couple of miles away but works in the   neighborhood and has worked in the neighborhood since January of 2000.  He does not know                       7   complaints about the Ole Lounge and feels Mitch is a good manager and the lounge is good for    the community.  Based on his knowledge about the operation of the Ole Lounge he feels Mitch   would run a good establishment at the new place.       On cross the witness stated he went to the Ole Lounge about once a month.  Mitch told   him about charges pending against the Ole Lounge and also told him of allegations of a battery   that occurred at the Ole Lounge.         Ronald Neville has been a licensed attorney since January of 1971 and has been   practicing civil and criminal litigation in private practice since 1976.  He first met Mitch in 2008   when he represented Mitch in a civil matter with an insurance company.  That matter was settled   in August of 2009 but final procedures went on until October of 2009.  In September of 2009   Mitch told him a Chicago Police Officer called and wanted to speak with him.  The officer had   not told Mitch why the officer wanted to meet him.  Neville advised Mitch not to talk to the   police officer until they found out what the issue was.  He further told Mitch under the Illinois    United States Constitutions he was not obligated to speak to a police officer about anything.    Mitch was told to tell any police officers that called him that Neville represented him and they   wanted to know what the subject matter was.  On October 2, 2009, Neville called an Officer   Torres at 312-744-0570, which was the number for the 19th District.  Officer Torres was not   available and Neville left a message on an answering machine for Officer Torres.  In that   message Neville told Torres that he was calling in response to Torres= call to Mitch and further   told Torres he was Mitch=s attorney and they needed to talk about subject matter of Torres=                       13

I want to be certain  you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you  have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,899 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Oakley  Avenue, from W. Cermak Road to W. 24th Street, and in W. 22nd Place, from S.  Western Avenue to S. Oakley Avenue. The old main dates back to 1886 and needs  to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Solis’ office, and he has made clear we are to  put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas H. Powers, P.E.   Commissioner       cc: Alderman Daniel Solis        25th Ward                                                     Do you wonder what was happening in 1886?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                 SIGMUND FREUD              Pharmacist Dr. John Stith Pemberton invented a carbonated beverage that would be   named “Coca-Cola”.  In New York Harbor, President Grover Cleveland dedicated the Statue of Liberty.       Baseball Hall of Famer Ty Cobb was born.    Karl Benz patented the first successful gasoline-driven automobile.    The first Tournament of Roses was held in Pasadena, California.    Sigmund Freud opened practice in Vienna.    The London Times published the world’s very first classified ad.                  PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,899 feet of 8-inch water main in  S. Oakley Avenue, from W. Cermak Road to W. 24th Street, and in W. 22nd Place, from S.  Western Avenue to S. Oakley Avenue.           Reason: The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1886, and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Work starts shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in late July (restoration will  follow in late August). This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected  developments in the street, or other circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our  schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Oakley Avenue and W. 22nd Place without  interruption, but we will have to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   ALDERMAN DANIEL SOLIS   773-523-4100   3-1-1         312-742-1029   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July.  Restoration will follow in late August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

The Chicago Infrastructure  Trust will allow us to consider transformative infrastructure projects and build a world- class infrastructure for our city.”    Mayor Emanuel announced the Trust on March 1, in an event in which he was joined by  former President Bill Clinton.     Through a new program called Retrofit Chicago, energy efficiency work will be the first  series of investments made by the Trust, pending approval by the City Council. By  aggregating energy efficiency projects across the City and its sister agencies and tapping  into private investment, the Trust will accelerate retrofit projects that would otherwise not  have been possible. The City currently spends $170 million annually on energy  consumption. This project will reduce energy costs by more than $20 million annually,  create nearly 2,000 construction jobs, and remove the equivalent of more than 30,000 cars’  worth of emissions from the atmosphere annually.                  The Chicago Infrastructure Trust will provide advantaged financing, enabling each project  to customize a financing structure using taxable or tax-exempt debt, equity investments  and other forms of support. Each project will be coordinated with the City and its sister  agencies’ long-term plan for transformational infrastructure investments.      The Chicago Infrastructure Trust was created in concert with the private sector, non-profit  organizations, and union leaders. An amended ordinance was submitted this week, which  calls for one Alderman to be on the Trust’s board, and clarifies that the Trust will be  completely subject to FOIA, Open Meetings laws, and the City’s ethics ordinance.     The Trust will require City Council approval for all projects, and will operate as a Non- Profit organization as it seeks projects.      The Trust passed by a vote of 41-7.     # # #

By late September 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 6,273 feet of new 12-inch water main in S. South  Chicago Avenue, from E. Marquette Road to E. 73rd Street. The old water main dates back to 1890,  and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  5th Ward Office: 773-324-5555  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635        Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.   Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:         HARPO MARX         In Chicago, the Republican Convention opened at the Auditoium Building. General  Benjamin Harrison and Levi Morton won the nominations.  In Washington DC, the National Geographic Society was founded.       The Kodak camera increased the popularity of photography as a hobby.    An unknown inventor devleoped “Mum” deodorant, which is widely recognized as the   first personal product designed to prevent body odor.     American comedian Harpo Marx was born.    “Jack the Ripper” murdered at least five women in London, England.    William Bundy patented the timecard clock.    The first organized rodeo competition was held, in Prescott, Arizona.                         WELLS ST. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,260 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Wells Street, from W. North Avenue to W. Schiller Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of a 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Furthermore,  the old pipe dates back to 1888 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by mid September 2012. Restoration (to be completed by the Chicago  Department of Transportation) will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other  factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Wells Street outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main installation is slated to conclude in  mid September 2012. Restoration (to be completed by the Chicago Department of  Transportation) will follow. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,118 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Forest Avenue, from 155 feet South of E. 113th Street to W. 115th Street.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1907 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late May 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Forest Avenue outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late May 2013.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?

The applicant filed a timely appeal of that denial with the License Appeal   Commission of the City of Chicago.          Prior to the hearing, the parties entered into a Stipulation of Facts which regaled the need   for live testimony.  In essence, pursuant to this stipulation, the parties agreed to the following   facts:                 a.       That with respect to the properties referred under the street addressed 931-967 W.   Cuyler Avenue, 900-924 W. Irving Park, and 4000 N. Broadway Street, Chicago,   there are 19 separate parcels of property.     1   b.     c.     d.       e.     f.     g.       h.        i.     j.         k.     l.       m.     n.       That with respect to Parcels 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 the named grantee   in the last deed of record is Thorek Hospital and Medical Center.    That with respect to Parcel 4, the named grantee in the last deed of record is   Thorek Hospital and Medical Center, Inc.   That with respect to Parcel 7, the named grantee in the last deed of record is   Harris Bank Hinsdale, as Trustee under the provisions of the trust agreement   dated May 15, 1986, and known as Trust Number L-11241.      That with respect to Parcel 14, the named grantee on the last deed of record is   Thorek Memorial Hospital.    That with respect to Parcel 1, the named grantee in the deed of record is Thorek   Medical Center.    That with respect to Parcels 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 (Parcels 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21   respectively, on the survey by National Survey Service, Inc.) the named grantee   on the last deed of record is American Hospital of Chicago.     That the applicant premises with a street address of 953 W. Irving Park Road is   located on the south side of Irving Park Road and the east side of North Sheridan   Road.    That the Hospital Building sits on Parcel nos. 19, 20, 21, 13, 6, 15, 16, 22,    and 23 (collectively, the “Hospital Building Parcels”).    That on the remaining parcels including parcels nos. 14, 10, 9, 12, 11, 17, and 18   (collectively, “the Hospital Parking Lot Parcels”) several parking lots have been   constructed and are used regularly by the employees of Thorek Hospital and   nearby offices, as well as, by medial patients and hospital visitors.    Of the Hospital Building Parcels, Parcel No. 19 is located nearest to the   applicant’s premises.      The distance from the applicant premises to the nearest Hospital Building Parcels   (as measured from the property line of the northeast corner of the applicant   premises to the property line of the southwest corner of Parcel 19) is 453.85 feet.    Of the Hospital Parking Lot Parcels, Parcel No. 14 is located nearest to the   applicant premises.       The distance from the applicant premises to the nearest point of the Hospital   Parking Lot Parcels (as measured from the northernmost property line of the   applicant premises to the southernmost property line of Parcel No. 14) is 73 feet.   2                                                                                                 “Hospital” means any institution, place, building, building, buildings on a campus, or  agency, public or private, whether organized for profit or not, devoted primarily to the  maintenance and operation of facilities for the diagnosis and treatment or care of 2 or  more unrelated persons admitted for overnight stay or longer in order to obtain medical,  including obstetric, psychiatric and nursing, care of illness, disease, injury, infirmity or  deformity.     RELEVANT STATUES AND ORDINANCES:     210 ILSCS 85/3 – As used in this Act:   A.              ILCS 5/6-11(a) – No licenses shall be issued for sale at retail of any alcoholic liquor within 100  feet of any church, hospital…    Chicago Municipal Code:  In addition to the restrictions cited in Section 6-11 of the Illinois  Liquor Control Act of 1934, as amended, no license shall be issued for the sale of retail alcoholic  liquor within 100 feet of any library…         At the time oral argument was held in this case, neither party nor this Commissioner was   aware of the statutory definition of hospital.  That is unfortunate because it seems to this   Commissioner that the state statute defining hospital is the controlling statute in this case.  A   hospital under the statute refers to a specific building or other area devoted primarily to treatment   and care of 2 or more people.  The statute does not encompass parking lots used by employees of   the hospital and nearby offices, as well as, medical patients and hospital visitors.  The statute   does not support a theory that the fact that a parcel of land is owned by a hospital is sufficient to   use the lot line of that parcel to measure distance to the hospital.  The fact that Thorek Memorial   Hospital owns Parcel 14, and the fact that Parcel 14 is 73 feet from the applicant’s property is not   a basis under the state statute to deny this license.  Since the Municipal Code adopts the language   of the state statute, the ordinance does not set forth a basis to deny this license.          3      Applying the plain language of the state statute, the property line of the parcel of real   estate on which the hospital building sits is 453.85 feet from the property line of the applicant’s   property.           The decision of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner denying a Packaged Goods   license to Walgreens for the premises located at 953 W. Irving Park Road is reversed.                                                          4   THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED That the said order or action of the Local      Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago be and the same hereby is REVERSED.       Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a petition for rehearing may be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order  is deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the  Circuit Court, the petition for rehearing must be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days  after service of this order as such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.        Dated:  September 17, 2013     Dennis M. Fleming   Chairman     Donald O’Connell   Member         5

The Department of Water Management’s private contractor is installing 2,800 feet of 24- inch to 54-inch new sewer main in W. 100th Street (Normal-Emerald) and in W. 101st Street  (Morgan-Green). The old sewer dates back to 1893 and needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    9th Ward Office: 773-785-1100    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,959 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Harvard Avenue, from W.  64th Street to W. 65th Street, in W. 64th Street, from S. Stewart Avenue to S. Harvard Avenue,  and in W. 65th Street, from S. Stewart Avenue to S. Yale Avenue. The old pipe dates back to  1897, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Cochran’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Willie Cochran                   20th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            Do you wonder what was happening in 1897?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                       ELVA ZONA HEASTER        Elva Zona Heaster was found dead in Greenbrier County, West Virginia.  The resulting  murder trial of her husband was perhaps the only case in United States history where the  testimony of a ghost helped secure a conviction.     Grant’s Tomb was dedicated.    The Klondike Gold Rush began when the first successful prospectors arrived in Seattle.    The Boston subway opened, becoming the first underground metro in North America.    Dracula, a novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, was published.    The play Cyrano de Bergerac, by Edmund Rostand, premiered in Paris, France.                  HARVARD/64TH/65TH WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,959 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Harvard Avenue, from W. 64th Street to W. 65th Street, in W. 64th Street, from  S. Stewart Avenue to S. Harvard Avenue, and in W. 65th Street, from S. Stewart Avenue to S.  Yale Avenue.      Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1897 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late May 2013. Restoration will follow in June 2013. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Harvard, 64th Street, and 65th Street outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late May 2013.  Restoration will be completed in June 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since  we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.                Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.

Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. 101st Street outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,918 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Sawyer Avenue, from W.  Carmen Avenue to W. Lawrence Avenue, W. Argyle Street, from N. Spaulding Avenue to N.  Kedzie Avenue and N. Spaulding Avenue, from W. Argyle Street to W. Lawrence Avenue. The  old pipe dates back to 1909, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Mell’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:          ERROL FLYNN        Joan of Arc was declared a saint.    The first Lincoln head pennies were minted.    The Indianapolis 500 race track opened.    Actor Errol Flynn was born.    Workers began pouring concrete for the Panama Canal.    The first subway car with side doors went into service in New York City.           Minnesota.     The first U.S. university school of nursing was established, at the University of              SAWYER AVE., ARGYLE ST. & SPAULDING AVE.   WATER PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,918 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Sawyer Avenue, from W. Carmen Avenue to W. Lawrence Avenue, W. Argyle  Street, from N. Spaulding Avenue to N. Kedzie Avenue and N. Spaulding Avenue, from W.  Argyle Street to W. Lawrence Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in early July 2015. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Sawyer Avenue, W. Argyle Street and N. Spaulding  Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to  traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it  means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local  traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ALDERMAN DEBORAH MELL   773-478-8040                                         CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in early July 2015.  This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is  any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.    Want to learn more?  http://www.cityofchicago.org/watermanagement/bfp             DEPA RTM EN T OF WATER MANAGEM EN T            C ITY  OF CHICAGO    What is MeterSave?    MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

By late November 2015, the Department of Water Management (DWM) and Joel Kennedy  Constructing Corp. crews will begin the work to install 6,313 feet of new 8-inch and 492  feet of new 12-inch water main in N. Elston Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W. Barry  Avenue, N. Elston Avenue, from N. Campbell Avenue to N. Western Avenue, N. Albany  Avenue, from N. Elston Avenue to W. Roscoe Street and W. Fletcher Street, from N. Elston  Avenue to 125’east of N. Elston Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1890, and needs  to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to www.buildinganewchicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply  enter your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this  letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.      Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  33rd Ward Office: 773-478-8040  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for several  minutes.

If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.

Watercraft means any boat, vessel, or other craft used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.  Who is responsible for payment of the tax?  The individual being charged a mooring or docking fee is responsible for payment of the tax to the marina or docking facility.   Who is responsible for collection of the tax?  Effective January 1st, 2006, all Chicago mooring and docking facilities are responsible for collecting and remitting the tax to the Department.  The tax must be collected at the time the fee is collected.  Is there a commission granted for collecting and remitting the tax?  Yes, the collector is allowed a commission of 1% of the tax collected and timely remitted to the Department.  To be considered timely, the remittance and return must be physically received or received in an envelope postmarked by the Unites States Postal Service on or before the due date.  Per chapter 3-4 of the Municipal Code, late payments incur interest at a rate of 12% per annum simple interest, calculated daily, based on a 365 day calendar year and a late penalty rate of 5% of the tax due.  How often is the Boat Mooring Tax  remitted and when are returns due?  The tax is to be remitted monthly with taxes collected in one month payable by the last day of the subsequent month.  The tax return for periods commencing on July 1st of each year and ending on June 30 of the subsequent year, is filed annually and is due by August 15th of each year.  Questions?

In August, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 2,306 feet of new  8-inch water main in W. Fillmore Street (Homan-Sacramento) and in S. Troy Street (Fillmore- Roosevelt). The old water main dates back to 1887, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    24th Ward Office: 773-533-2400    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner      Genwmnot03032016

By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    22nd Ward Office: 773-762-1771    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner      Genwmnot03032016

By late May 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Reliable Contracting &  Equipment Company crews will begin the work to install 331 feet of new 8-inch water main in   W. Walnut Street, from N. Halsted Street to 200 feet east of N. Halsted Street and W. Walnut Street,  from N. Union Avenue to N. Desplaines Street. The old water main dates back to 1885, and needs to  be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  42nd Ward Office: 312-642-4242  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:           Crisco, the all-vegetable shortening, was introduced.    On November 11, a record cold snap (later known as The Great Blue Norther) hit the   midwest United States. Many cities broke record highs and lows on the same day.     The Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre. It was recovered in 1913.    Ground breaking began in Boston for Fenway Park.    An audience threw vegetables at actors for the first recorded time in the U.S.    Lucille Ball was born.    The South Pole was reached for the first time, by Norwegian Roald Amundsen.

Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late September 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Campbell Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                                              CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN LONA LANE   773-471-1991       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late September  2014. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

In early March, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 3,768 feet of  new 8-inch water main in S. Cregier Avenue (83rd Street-85th Street), in E. 84th Street (Stony Island- Cregier), and in E. 83rd Place (Stony Island-Cregier). The old water main dates back to 1915, and  needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    8th Ward Office: 773-874-3300    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

Henry]   has a conflict of interest or is otherwise not in compliance with the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance by virtue of his service for the [ABCD                                     Project]        , and his work with respect to a grant [ABCD] is submitting to the                                            [P Foundation]   .  After reviewing materials you sent to us that day, we informed you orally of our conclusion that Mr. [Henry’s] activities with respect to [ABCD] do not place him in a conflict of interest or otherwise place him in a position that is non- compliant with the Ordinance.  There are, however, several restrictions to which he is subject, and of which you should be aware.  This letter details our conclusion, and reviews those restrictions.  Mr. [Henry] is a full-time          Grants Specialist with your Division of the [C]           Department      .  He manages federal grants focusing on [topic 1]                  and [topic 2]                .  On his non-City time, he also has been serving, since           , as the first President of [ABCD].  He is not compensated for this work.   [ABCD] is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, established in             , as the funding arm of the [ABCDE]                                                              . [ABCDE] itself is also a non-profit organization, founded in part by Mr. [Henry]  in 2002.  Its mission is to help                 practitioners                                                                                                                                                                                             , to better understand and implement the principles of [topic 3]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               . [ABCDE] has sponsored conferences statewide, and conducted training and technical assistance seminars in schools and public safety  agencies.  [ABCDE’s]        Coordinating  Council  (of  which  Mr.  [Henry]  is  a member) determined that a non-profit should be created to apply for funding in support of its mission.  Hence, [ABCD]       was established in             with Mr. [Henry] as its first President.  About that time, two Coordinating Council members learned that the [P] Foundation had identified Illinois as its second statewide                 initiative location, and allocated funds to use for an Illinois “Model             Project.”   [ABCD] has applied to the Foundation for a grant of $100-125,000 per year for 3 years under this project.  The grant, if awarded, would fund: 1) more extensive  training  programs  [ABCDE]  would  conduct  for  clergy,  judges,  and “training the trainers”; 2) university-based researchers   retained by [ABCDE]      who would design a data collection and self-evaluation protocol; and 3) expansion of  [ABCDE]’s listserve and website.  Concurrently, you said, the [C] is applying to the Foundation’s        Case No. 05067.Q November 21, 2005 Page 2               Program for a $1.5 million grant to fund the Department’s [K]       initiative                                                                             . [K]       is a system of related internet-based programs designed to transmit relevant information to the public                                                                                              , and create and store [C] records online.  Mr. [Henry] has not worked on this application.  In the materials you sent us, Mr. [Henry] writes, and you have confirmed, that this [C] application, if awarded, would be funded from a source within the Foundation, namely the [U]                Program, that is different from the source to which [ABCD] has applied and which would fund its grant, namely the                   Model         Project, and that the [ABCD]  request is not “in competition with” [C’s] request.  In addition, he also writes, and you have confirmed,  that  he  has  discussed  with  you  his  participation  in  [ABCD]  and  [ABCDE],  and  the  latter’s application to the [P] Foundation.  On these facts, we conclude that, by virtue of his service for [ABCD]       and [ABCDE] and his involvement in [ABCD’s] grant application to the [P] Foundation, Mr. [Henry] does not have a conflict of interest, and has not acted in a way that does not comply with the Governmental Ethics Ordinance.  Several sections of the Ordinance are relevant to this conclusion, and there are several related restrictions on Mr. [Henry’s] conduct, of which both he and you should be aware, prospectively, regarding his [ABCD] and [ABCDE]      service.  We discuss each in order.  First, Section 2-156-020, “Fiduciary Duty,” provides that City employees, at all times in the performance of their public duties, owe a fiduciary duty to the City.  Our Board has interpreted this general provision to require that a City employee use his City position and time responsibly and in the public’s best interest, and that he give undivided loyalty to the City in the discharge of his public duties.  And, it precludes the use of City time and resources to obtain a personal benefit or promote a purely private interest. Case Nos. 96032.A; 03037.Q.  As President of  [ABCD], and as a Governing Council member of [ABCDE], Mr. [Henry] would also owe a fiduciary duty to both organizations; in the event that his fiduciary duties to the City and these organizations were to conflict, he would be required to resolve the conflict in the City’s favor. Our conclusion that Mr. [Henry] has not compromised his fiduciary duty to the City is based on the following: i) neither [ABCD] nor [ABCDE] receive funding from the City of Chicago; ii) neither [ABCD] or [ABCDE] compete directly with the City or with [C] for funding through the [P]          Foundation; and iii) Mr. [Henry] been involved in the [K]       application to the Foundation.  However, we advise you and Mr. [Henry]  to ensure that, to avoid any appearance of impropriety, as long as he serves as an [ABCD] or [ABCDE] officer or Council member, he bring to your (or his other supervisors’) attention any actual or potential grant application that [ABCD] or ABCDE] is considering that would compete with [C] or any of its grant opportunities as soon as he becomes aware of the potential competition, and that he remove himself from any further participation in the application on behalf of [ABCD] or [ABCDE] and disclose this in writing to [C] and to [ABCD] or [ABCDE].  Second,  Section  2-156-090,  “Representation  of  Other  Persons,”  prohibits  a  City  employee  from “representing”  any  person,  such  as  [ABCD]  or  [ABCDE],  before  any  City  agency  or  department  with respect to any non-ministerial action or decision of that agency or department.  Our Board has interpreted the  term  “representation”  to  include  a  broad  range  of  activities  in  which  one  person  acts  as  a spokesperson for another person, or seeks to communicate and promote the interests of one party to another, such as making personal appearances before [C] or other City agencies on behalf of another, making  telephone  contact  on  another’s  behalf  with  City  employees  and  officials,  submitting  written requests  or  proposals on their behalf to City agencies, or signing contracts on their behalf with City agencies. See Case Nos. 91047.A, 96032.A., 03037.Q.  Nothing in the facts presented to us indicates that Mr. [Henry] has represented either [ABCD] or [ABCDE] before [C] or any other City department or agency- -but we advise you prospectively that he is subject to this restriction with respect to his activities on behalf of [ABCD] and [ABCDE].    Case No. 05067.Q November 21, 2005 Page 3  Third,  Section  2-156-060, “City-Owned Property,” prohibits a City employee from the unauthorized use of City property, including City time, equipment or supplies, to carry out his duties for [ABCD] or [ABCDE] Fourth, Section 2-156-070, “Use or Disclosure of Confidential Information,” prohibits a City employee from using or revealing confidential information he has acquired during the course of his City job, whether to benefit [ABCD], [ABCDE] or any other person.  Nothing in the facts presented to us indicates that Mr. [Henry] has either engaged in the unauthorized use of City property or used or revealed  confidential information--but we again advise you prospectively that he is subject to these restrictions with respect to his activities on behalf of [ABCD] and [ABCDE].

This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,744 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Locust Street, from N.  Franklin Street to N. La Salle Drive, and N. Franklin Street, from W. Oak Street to W. Chicago  Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1885, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Burnett’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.

Patton was born.                             LOCUST ST. AND FRANKLIN ST. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,744 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Locust Street, from N. Franklin Street to N. La Salle Drive, and N. Franklin  Street, from W. Oak Street to W. Chicago Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of a 6-inch pipe, and we what to expand capacity. Furthermore,  the old pipe dates back to 1885 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by mid October 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.     Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Locust Street and N. Franklin Street outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                                                   ALDERMAN WALTER BURNETT JR.   3-1-1   773- 432-1995   312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main installation is slated to conclude in  mid October 2012. Restoration (to be completed by the Chicago Department of Transportation)  will follow. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other  factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

SECURE all openings to prevent unlawful entry.     Openings with secure doors and windows, without broken or cracked glass, may   be left as-is so long as they remain secure and in good condition.     Openings may be boarded with plywood or secured by other reasonable means.    At least one exit must be maintained (more for larger buildings).   If a property has repeated break-ins, additional measures may be required.      2.  REGISTER the vacant building on the Department of Buildings web site. (see below)     A registration fee ($500) is required at the time of initial registration.    The registration must be renewed every 6 months for as long as the building  remains vacant, and material changes in the registration information must be  reported through the website within 20 days.  There is no fee for renewal.  3.    POST signs on the building, visible and legible from the nearest street and alley.     The signs must include the name, address, and phone number of the registered  mortgagee (or mortgagee’s agent) and the vacant building registration number.  4.  MAINTAIN the property and inspect regularly to verify the exterior is clean and secure.     Keep the lot clean. Maintain fences and gates. Cut the grass, remove weeds,   garbage, debris, dead trees and fallen limbs. In winter, shovel any accumulated  snow to allow public use of the adjacent sidewalk and keep the property free  from pests such as rats and other rodents.     Winterize the building’s heating and plumbing systems.    Maintain the exterior of the building (walls, windows, doors and roof) and stairs   and steps leading to the main entrance.   These requirements are subject to certain limitations and defenses.  Consult the Municipal Code  of Chicago for complete details.  Failure to comply with these requirements may result in serious  penalties.  Registration of a vacant building will not prevent the City of Chicago from seeking  authority to demolish or secure a vacant building as authorized by law  A property must be deregistered if the loan is transferred or released or if the building is  reoccupied, sold, or demolished. A new owner registration must be created by any person  who takes title to a vacant building following a judicial sale or other foreclosure-related transfer,  including REO, within 30 days of taking ownership.

General Information:  The Tax is imposed on the privilege of transferring title to, or beneficial interest in, real property located in the City of Chicago.  See section 3-33-030 of the Code.  The tax rate is $3.75 per $500.00 of the transfer price, or fraction thereof, of the real property, or beneficial interest in the property.  Id.  Governmental or Charitable Organization Exemption - Subsection 3-33-060(B) of the Code; Section 3, Paragraph B of the Form:  Transfers involving real property (1) acquired by or from a governmental body; (2) acquired by any corporation, society, association, foundation or institution organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious or educational purposes; or (3) acquired by any international organization not subject to local taxes under applicable law are exempt.  The Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddy Mac”) do not qualify as governmental bodies.  Transfers for less than $500 - Subsection 3-33-060(E) of the Municipal Code; Section 3, Paragraph E of the Form:  Transfers in which the transfer  price is less than $500 are exempt.  The “transfer price” means the consideration furnished for the transfer of title to, or beneficial interest in, real property, valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits and property, determined without any deduction for mortgages, liens or encumbrances, and specifically including the amount of any indebtedness or obligation canceled or discharged in connection with the transfer.  See subsection 3-33- 020(H).   Typical types of transfers that fall into this category are (1) transfers between a trust and its beneficiaries and (2) transfers of gifts.  With respect to transfers between trusts and their beneficiaries, only the following types of transfers are exempt from the tax:  (a) transfers from the sole beneficiaries to the trust, where the trust agreement provides that the beneficial ownership of the beneficiaries is the same as it was before the transfer into trust, and (b) transfers from the trust to the sole beneficiaries of the trust, where the distribution agreement provides that the ownership of the beneficiaries is the  same as it was before the transfer out of the trust.  With respect to transfers which result from divorce or separation proceedings, it is presumed that the consideration given for the transfer of real property between spouses is equal to the fair market value of the interest conveyed, and is subject to the Tax.  For example, if one spouse is ordered or agrees to transfer to the other spouse his or her interest in real property, which is owned jointly with the other spouse, the spouse who receives the transferring spouse’s interest is subject to taxation; and the amount of the transfer price will be presumed to be one-half of the fair market value of the real property .  See Chicago Department of Revenue Real Property Transfer Tax Ruling #3, October 3, 2005.   Transfers of property in exchange for an interest in a corporation, limited liability corporation, or other legal entity are taxable events, unless the transferor is the sole owner of the legal entity to which the property is being transferred.  The transfer price is the fair market value of the real property.  For example, if an individual or legal entity transferred its real property to a partnership and received only a one-half interest in the partnership, a Transfer Tax would be due on one-half of the fair market value of the real property.  Enterprise Zone Exemption - Subsection 3-33-060(L) of the Code; Section 3, Paragraph L of the Form:  Transfers of title to, or beneficial  October 2005  Questions?

Transfers where the property is intended to be converted into residential use and such use consumes 50% or more of the property do not qualify for the exemption.  See Chicago Department of Revenue Real Property Transfer Tax Ruling #2, May 13, 2004.    Transfers to Secured Creditors - Subsection 3-33-060(M) of the Code; Section 3, Paragraph M of the Form:  Transfers in which the deed or other instrument of transfer is issued to the mortgagee or secured creditor pursuant to a mortgage or security interest foreclosure proceeding or sale or pursuant to a transfer in lieu of foreclosure are exempt.  When a creditor holds a secured interest in property (e.g., a bank or savings and loan through a mortgage) and acquires the property either (a) at a foreclosure sale for an amount, which is equal to or less than the outstanding debt that is secured by the property, or (b) through a deed from the debtor in lieu of the foreclosure action, the transfer is exempt from the Tax.  A second mortgagee that acquires property through a foreclosure and assumes the debt of the primary secured lender is taxable on the amount of the outstanding debt owed to the primary lender.  For example, if a primary lender has an outstanding debt of $200,000 secured with real property, and a second lender has an outstanding debt of $100,000 secured with the same property; and if the second lender took a deed for the property from the debtor, in lieu of foreclosing on the property, then the second lender would incur a tax on the amount of the outstanding debt, which  it assumed (i.e., $200,000).  Other information:  Where the transfer price reported on the Form is different than the purchase price of the property, the difference must be fully explained, with full documentation attached to the Form.  The Transfer Tax is due upon the earlier of the delivery or recording of the deed, assignment or other instrument of transfer (see section 3- 33-030) and is payable through the purchase of stamps (see section 3- 33-040).  Title companies are responsible for making sure that stamps are purchased, cancelled, and affixed to the deed or other instrument of transfer, when they receive the proceeds for the stamps at the closing.  See section 3-33-040.  Failure to purchase and affix the stamps will subject them to interest and penalties that accrue on the unpaid tax.  A program is being offered by the City during the period beginning October 24, 2005, and ending December 16, 2005, to provide amnesty from interest and penalties on Transfer Tax liabilities incurred prior to July 1, 2005.  Amnesty is not available with respect to any tax identified in any written notice of tax audit or tax investigation that the Department has sent to a taxpayer or other debtor.  Persons interested in acquiring amnesty  must apply by filling out the application available at www.cityofchicago.org.  A person’s failure to properly apply for amnesty continues to subject such person to penalties and interest on unpaid Transfer Taxes, and may also subject the person to an additional amnesty penalty.

This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,109 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Dickens Avenue, from  N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Spaulding Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1893 and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Maldonado’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       MAE WEST                          The World’s Columbian Exposition opened in Chicago.    Henry Perky and William Ford patented shredded wheat.    The first bowling magazine, which was called Gut Holz, was published.    France issued the first driver’s licenses, which included a required test.    Katharine Lee Bates wrote ""America the Beautiful,"" in Colorado.    Lizzie Borden was acquitted in the murder of her parents in New Bedford,   Massachusetts.     New Zealand became the first country to grant all its women the right to vote.    Actress Mae West was born.             DICKENS AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,109 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Dickens Avenue, from N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Spaulding Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1893 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by late January 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Dickens Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      ALDERMAN ROBERTO MALDONADO   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   3-1-1   773-395-0143   312-742-1021                                                    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  January 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!            "

Daley, Mayor   What is the risk?             January 15, 2010   Chicago Department of Public Health  Bechara Choucair, MD, Commissioner   As of January 15, 2010, the risk of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) influenza infection in Chicago continues to be  low. The numbers of severe influenza infections, influenza-like illnesses, and positive influenza tests have all de- creased.  Due to the possibility of a recurrence of heightened activity in the coming months, all Chicagoans aged  six months and older are encouraged to protect themselves from infection by getting vaccinated with the pandemic  influenza vaccine. Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  For  those without a healthcare provider or whose healthcare providers do not have the pandemic vaccine, a schedule of  City of Chicago pandemic vaccine clinics1 is available on the City website and by calling 311.   Figure 1. Reported number of hospitalizations associated with  confirmed or presumptive pandemic influenza A (H1N1), Chicago,  by week of specimen collection, April 2009 - January 9, 2010    Figure 2. Percent of patient visits to enrolled doctor’s offices  attributed to influenza-like illness, Chicago, by week, for current  season (2009-10) and previous two seasons, October-May     Are severe cases of influenza occurring?       Three confirmed or presumptive pandemic   influenza A (H1N1)-associated hospitalizations in  Chicago residents have been reported for surveil- lance week 1 (January 3 –  9, 2010). This is a 98%  decrease from the highest reported weekly count of  the fall, reported in early November, and represents  the ninth consecutive week that a decline has been  noted (figure 1).          How much influenza-like illness is occurring?       With 14 Chicago hospitals reporting, 5.0% of       emergency department visits were due to influenza- like illness (i.e. fever of 100°F or greater, with  cough or sore throat).  This represents the lowest  activity level reported since early October and a  41% decrease from the previous surveillance  week.  Among five outpatient clinics reporting for  the week of January 3 –  9, 2010, 3.2% of doctor’s  office visits were due to influenza-like illness.   This level of activity is similar to levels seen dur- ing the same surveillance week during previous  influenza seasons (figure 2).       Which influenza strains are circulating?   For the week of January 3 –  9, 2010, with six  laboratories reporting, all 9 influenza A-positive  specimens for which subtyping was performed  were reported as confirmed or presumptive pan- demic influenza A (H1N1); one influenza B strain  was also reported.          Where can I get more information?                                                                                                                   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  FluView2 report provides national updates and trends related to the intensity of influenza activity across the United  States, as well as detailed information on antiviral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics. Updates specific  to Illinois3 and Suburban Cook County4 are also available online.       1http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_EDITORIAL/JanuaryScheduleH1N1_enlgish.pdf;   2http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/; 3 http://www.idph.state.il.us/flu/fluupdate08-09.htm; 4 http://www.cookcountypublichealth.org/flu_current_situation

As  we  all  know  by  now,  we  are,  as  City  government  personnel,  subject  to  rules  and  restrictions on what gifts we can receive, whether  during the end-of-year holidays or any other time.        This  brief  guide  explains  the  rules.    Please  follow  them.    Violations  of  these  rules  could  lead  to  employment sanctions, removal from office, and/or fines, and public shaming.  No gift is worth that.    Remember also to check your own department’s or office’s gift rules, as they may be stricter than  those in the City’s Ethics Ordinance. Ask your departmental ethics officer about that.        THE GIFT RULES:     ○ You can’t solicit or accept any cash or gift card in any amount, unless it falls into one of the limited  exceptions listed below.  ○ You can’t solicit or accept any single non-cash, non-gift card gift, or combination of gifts, worth  more  than  $50  from  a  single  source  in  a  calendar  year,  unless  it  falls  into  one  of  the  limited  exceptions below.  ○ You can’t accept any anonymous gift, unless it falls into one of the limited exceptions below.  ○ You can’t solicit or accept  anything based on an understanding that your City decisions, actions or  judgments will be affected by it—no exceptions.  ○  You  can’t  accept  a  complimentary  invitation  for  a  vendor’s  holiday  party  unless  you  and  your  department head believe that your attendance is related to your City responsibilities, and you report  it to the Board of Ethics within 10 days. You can, of course, pay your own way.  We recommend that  you do. You are not prohibited from socializing with vendors or others!  ○  These  rules  also  apply  to  gifts  offered  to  or  accepted  by  your  spouse  or  domestic  partner,  and  immediate family members living in the same residence as you.     THE LIMITED EXCEPTIONS:   You may solicit or accept:    ● Gifts from your relatives, including cash or gift cards, in any amount;  ● Gifts from a personal friend, unless you have reason to believe that your friend offered you the  gifts because of your City position (we advise that “business friends” are not personal friends – a  personal friend is someone you know independently of your City position);    ● Anything for which you pay fair market value;  ● Anything offered to members of the public on the same terms, like sales promotions or discount  tickets;  ● Gifts you accept on the City's behalf, as long as they’re reported to the Board and City Comptroller  (but  they  must  be  useable  for  City  business  purposes  or  displayed  or  put  out  for  the  public’s  enjoyment – candy or Poinsettias qualify); and  ●  Gifts  offered  to  you  because  of  your  outside,  non-City  business,  employment,  or  community  activity.   GIFTS FROM OTHER CITY PERSONNEL, OFFICE PARTIES     ► City employees may give any gift to co-worker(s) at their level or at a lower pay rate.  ► However, they may not give their official superior(s) any holiday gift other than a non-cash item  or gift card worth $10 or less (even if their superior makes less money).  ► City employees may not solicit co-workers for a gift to any official superior.  ►  Gifts for  “white  elephant,”  “Secret  Santa,” or  grab-bag  parties  must  be worth  $10  or  less,  and  cannot be cash in any amount.  ► No official superior may ever coerce his or her subordinates into giving or contributing to a gift.  ► For in-office holiday parties, employees may contribute any amount toward food or drinks to be  shared in the office among co-workers.    “Official superior” means any other City employee(s), including your immediate supervisor(s), whose  official responsibilities include directing or evaluating your performance—and the Mayor himself.    NOTE: You won’t violate the law if you promptly take reasonable action to return a prohibited gift or  transfer any tangible or perishable gift to a tax-exempt charity.    The Board of Ethics will help you figure out whether a gift or specific party plan is acceptable. Please  call us in advance for confidential advice or guidance.  There’s no such thing as a silly question.    Remember: Before accepting any gift, always consider not only whether the law allows you to keep  it,  but  whether  your  acceptance  may  create  the  perception  that  your  independent  judgment  or  integrity could be compromised. When in doubt, just say “no thanks.”                               RAHM EMANUEL, MAYOR  WILLIAM F.

By mid October 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 3,425 feet of new 8-inch water main in W. Cermak  Road, from S. Millard Avenue to S. Drake Avenue and S. Central Park Avenue, from W. Cermak Road  to W. 26th Street. The old water main dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  24th Ward Office:773-533-2400  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635        Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.   Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

I want to be certain you are well  informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you have any  questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,154 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Harper  Avenue, from E. 70th Street to E. 71st Street and in S. Dante Ave., from E. 70th  Street to E. 71st Street.  The old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Hairston’s office, and she has made clear we  are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.       Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner      cc:   Alderman Leslie A. Hairston            5th Ward                                                   Do you wonder what was happening in 1890?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                 CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                    HARPER AVE. AND DANTE AVE. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,154 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Harper Avenue, from E. 70th Street to E. 71st Street and in S. Dante Avenue,  from E. 70th Street to E. 71st Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late May 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.     Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Harper Ave. and Dante Ave. outside of our working  hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety.  You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate  in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.  .   Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      ALDERMAN LESLIE A. HAIRSTON   773-324-5555   3-1-1               ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late May 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

22852`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxRulingsandRegulations/TransTaxRuling5.pdf`Success`Success`3`3`Not a fillable PDF.`CITY OF CHICAGO   DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE   PERSONAL PROPERTY LEASE TRANSACTION TAX RULING   Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax Ruling #5  Subject: Usage of Computers and Computer Software  Effective date:  June 1, 2004    Formerly Ruling #9  Original effective date:  February 1, 1987  Amended:  February 15, 1988     TIME-SHARING                  Section 1.   Pursuant to section 3-32-030(A) of the Chicago Municipal Code     (“Code”), the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax (the “lease tax” or “tax”)  is imposed upon (1) the lease or rental in the City of personal property, or (2) the  privilege of using in the City personal property that is leased or rented outside the City.   Leased time on a computer is subject to the tax.  Section 3-32-020(H).  This includes the  time-sharing of a computer with other users.   For time-sharing purposes (where the  possession of the computer is not transferred), the user of the computer shall be deemed  using the computer at the location of the user's access terminal to the computer.   Therefore, if the user's terminal is within the City of Chicago, the lease tax will apply to  all charges for the use of the computer and its software, which is accessed by the user at  such terminal.  However, charges for the storage of information on the computer by the  user, which will be used at a later date by the user, and not in the immediate processing of  information, shall be deemed a usage of the computer at the computer location and not at  the access terminal; because this is not an actual use of the computer by means of an  access terminal but instead is a charge for storage at the computer location.  If at a later  date, a charge is made for accessing the stored information from a terminal located in  Chicago, such access charge would be taxable.     PRINTING   Section 2.   Charges for printing services or other services, provided that such     charges are not for the use of any personal property and are separately stated and  optional, are not  subject to the lease tax.  See Chicago Personal Property Lease  Transaction Tax Ruling #2004-3, which explains in general that a separately stated and  optional charge for services is excluded from tax.     COMPUTERS   Section 3.   Where the actual possession, but not title or ownership, of a     computer is transferred to a user for use in the City of Chicago, for consideration, such a  transaction is a lease subject to the  lease tax.  The tax will be due for all lease or rental  charges associated with the usage of the computer and its software in the City of Chicago.    Separately stated optional charges not for the use of the computer, its software or other  personal property used in the City shall not be subject to the lease tax.  An example  would be separately stated maintenance charges, if the charges are optional.     COMPUTER SOFTWARE      Section 4.      The lease or rental of computer software in the City of Chicago is  subject to the lease tax.  The sale of computer software is not subject to the lease tax.  To  determine whether a lease or rental of software occurs, the test is whether the use or  possession of such software is transferred for a consideration.  This would include all  agreements for the use or possession of such software including license agreements.  If  copyright licenses, waivers or releases are given along with the use of such software, this  will not affect the taxability of the transfer because such copyright licenses, waivers or  releases are a necessary part of the software being leased or rented.  Software under  copyright cannot be used without such licenses, waivers or releases.  Therefore, the fact  that a copyright license, waiver or release is given in a transaction will not affect its  taxability.  However, if title or ownership of the software passes in an agreement then a  sale occurs and no  lease tax would be due.  (Note: (1) If optional charges for update  services or other services are involved in the rental, and if these charges are not charges  for the use of any personal property, these charges may be separately stated and excluded  from the tax; (2) For time-sharing of software when no possession is transferred see  Sections 1 and 2 above.)    Examples of the application of Section 4:      an agreement called a copyright license agreement which transfers the possession and use  of certain software to the user, and allows such user to use such software on a month to  month basis for a payment of a specific monthly fee.  No other fees are charged the user.   At the end of the contract term or upon cancellation by the parties, the software is either  returned to the owner (or licensor) or erased.  Only incidental training and a question  answering service is provided and is a part of the monthly fee.  In this case, the total  monthly fee is taxable as a lease charge for the use of the software.      t that the agreement provides for an  indefinite use of the software for a flat fee of $2,000.00.  The user does not have to return  the software but can use the software for as long as he or she desires.  In this case, an  ownership interest in the software is transferred, so no tax is due.      monthly reports and the use of the owner's (or licensor's) personnel for training and  possible modification of the software are provided.  In such cases, if charges for such  services are separately stated and optional and are not charges for the use of any  additional personal property, such service charges are not taxable.     Same facts as (a.) above, except that update services such as   r licensor) and a Chicago user sign    (b)   Same facts as (a.) above, excep   (a)   A computer software owner (o   (c)    (d)   that in addition to the software   Same facts as (a) above, except     being leased, the owner (or licensor) agrees to customize the software for a specific fee.   The fee is a separately stated flat fee for the service of customizing the software, and the  fee is paid either in lump sum payment or in installments.  Accordingly, the monthly fee  for the use of the software is not increased for the customizing charge.  In such a case, the  monthly fee for the use of the software is taxable, but the charge for the customizing is  not.  If the customizing charge were incorporated into the monthly fee or otherwise  treated as part of the property being leased, in that the charge varies with the period of  use of the property, then the entire customizing charge would be taxable.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,378 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Oakdale Avenue, from  N. Lakewood Avenue to N. Seminary Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1911, and needs to be  replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Tunney’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       LUCILLE BALL                   Crisco, the all-vegetable shortening, was introduced.    On November 11, a record cold snap (later known as The Great Blue Norther 11/11/11)  hit the midwest United States. Many cities broke record highs and lows on the same day.     The Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre. It was recovered in 1913.    Ground breaking began in Boston for Fenway Park.    An audience threw vegetables at actors for the first recorded time in the U.S.    Lucille Ball was born.    The South Pole was reached for the first time, by Norwegian Roald Amundsen.                         WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,378 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Oakdale Avenue, from N. Lakewood Avenue to N. Seminary Avenue.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1911 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in July. Restoration will follow in August. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN TOM TUNNEY   773-525-6034      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE          312-742-1029                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in July. Restoration  will be completed in August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Currently, the risk of influenza infection in the Chicago area is low.  Nationally, influenza activity has also remained relatively  low.  To date, less than two percent of the 31,163 specimens tested for influenza at collaborating laboratories across the U.S. have  been positive, with 88% of these being  influenza A (44% subtyped as A (H3)).   Since October 2011, all viruses tested for antivi- ral resistance have been susceptible to the antiviral medications oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) and zanamivir (Relenza®).  However,   rare sporadic cases of oseltamivir resistant 2009 H1N1 and A (H3N2) viruses have been detected worldwide.  Vaccination is the  best way to protect against human seasonal influenza infection and all Chicagoans aged six months and older are encouraged to  get vaccinated. Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  Uninsured individuals  and those with insurance that does not cover flu shots can obtain a voucher for a free flu shot at Walgreens1.  The Chicago Depart- ment of Public Health has influenza vaccine available at CDPH immunization clinics2.      Figure 1. Weekly reported percent of emergency department visits  attributed to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current  season (2011-2012) and previous two seasons, October-May.   Are severe cases of influenza occurring?                                                                                                                                             No influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were re- ported for week 1 (January 1-7, 2012).  Since October  2011, one influenza-associated ICU hospitalization has  been reported.  Suspected novel influenza, pediatric influ- enza-associated deaths, and influenza-associated ICU  hospitalizations should all be reported to CDPH via  INEDSS3.  Outbreaks of influenza-like illness in a congre- gate setting are also reportable; in Chicago these reports  can be made by phone to (312) 746-5911.         Figure 2. Weekly reported percent of outpatient clinic visits attributed  to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current season (2011- 2012) and previous season (Chicago and Illinois), October-May.   How much influenza-like illness is occurring?            For the week of January 1-7, 2012, with 16 hospitals re- porting, 3.1% of emergency room visits were due to ILI  (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with cough or sore throat).  This is lower than levels reported during the same surveil- lance week in 2010 and is a two percentage point  de- crease from the previous week (Figure 1).  From January  1-7, 2012, with 16 outpatient clinics reporting, 3.0% of  outpatient clinic visits were due to ILI.  This is similar to  levels reported during the same surveillance week in 2010  (Figure 2).     Which influenza strains are circulating?                      Data on influenza virus test results are reported by Chi- cago laboratories performing influenza subtyping.  For  the week of January 1-7, 2012, with 4 laboratories report- ing, 4 of 208 specimens tested for influenza were posi- tive, all subtyped as human influenza A (H3N2).  Since  October 2011, 9 out of 1,986 specimens tested for influ- enza have been positive,  with 6 typed as influenza A (5  H3 and 1 not subtyped) and 3 typed as influenza B.       Where can I get more information?                            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Flu- View4 report provides national updates and trends related  to the intensity of influenza activity across the United  States, as well as detailed information on antiviral resis- tance, severity of illness, and other topics.

Western Ave.    November 2017      November is Pet Cancer    Awareness Month!       Wonder how you can reduce the risk of cancer for your pet? Know  the facts!     According to the Animal Cancer Foundation, here are three things  every pet owner should know!    1.  Cancer is the number one disease-related cause of death for   dogs in the United States.   2.  One in five cats will develop cancer in their lifetime.  3.  Cancer accounts for almost 50 percent of deaths in pets more   than 10 years old.      Source: www.acfoundation.org   According to VetInfo, cancer is usually identified by the presence  of a malignant tumor. The most common form of cancer in cats is  lymphoma. Older dogs are usually more affected by cancer than  younger dogs. If you notice a fast growing mass on your pet,  especially one that bleeds, or a loss of weight and appetite, you  should visit your vet right away.    Source: www.vetinfo.com     How can you help your pet?    The best way to beat cancer in your pet is early detection and  treatment. Depending on the type of cancer, treatment options  might include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. You  can also reduce your pet’s risk of cancer by keeping them at a  healthy weight, limiting their exposure to carcinogens and other  toxins, visiting a vet for regular checkups, and spaying/neutering  your pet!                       Live Like Roo: Helping Pets with Cancer    Live Like Roo is a Chicago-based charitable  foundation that helps dogs (and their owners)  through a pet’s cancer diagnoses by providing  emotional and financial support. Roo was rescued  from CACC in 2015. When it was discovered he was  suffering from bone cancer, founder Sarah Lauch  created a bucket list for the six months he had left to  live, and called it “Live Like Roo.” “It was a reminder  that we should all live like there is no tomorrow.  Now, we are helping other dogs with cancer do the  same,” said Sarah. Learn more at livelikeroo.org.        UPCOMING EVENTS   @CACC: 2741 S.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,551 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Hirsh Street, from N.  Long Avenue to N. Laramie Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1909, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Mitts’ office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:          ERROL FLYNN        The first U.S. university school of nursing was established, at the University of   Minnesota.     Joan of Arc was declared a saint.    The first Lincoln head pennies were minted.    The Indianapolis 500 race track opened.    Actor Errol Flynn was born.    Workers began pouring concrete for the Panama Canal.    The first subway car with side doors went into service in New York City.                         HIRSH ST. WATER PROJECT        PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,551 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Hirsh Street, from N. Long Avenue to N. Laramie Avenue.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late August 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Hirsh Street outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                    CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN EMMA MITTS   773-745-2894                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late August 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

By late October 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,482 feet of new 8-inch water main in E. 85th Street  from S. Burnham Avenue to S. Commercial Avenue, S. Muskegon Avenue, from S. Baltimore Avenue  to E. 85th Street and E. 84th Street, from S. Muskegon Avenue to S. Escanaba Avenue.  The old water  main dates back to 1909, and needs to be replaced.  We expect the water main work to be  completed by mid December 2017. Restoration will follow in mid April 2018. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  7th Ward Office: 773-731-7777      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

Loomis Street, from W. 21st Street to W. Cermak Road.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1875 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late May 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Loomis Street outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late May 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

In September, Department of Water Management crews will begin work to install a new  sewer main in N. Parkside Avenue (Diversey-George) and in W. George Street (Linder- Luna). The old sewer dates back to 1927 and needs to be replaced.     During construction, our project will require a full continuous closure of Diversey at  Parkside for about one week. Detour routes will be posted in advance. Otherwise, when we  are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always  be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.                Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

By late March 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 551 feet of new 8-inch water main in E. Balbo  Avenue, from S. State Street to S. Michigan Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1893, and  needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.

By late October, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 4,622 feet  of new 8-inch water main in N. Francisco Avenue (Cortez-Chicago), in N. Francisco Avenue  (Division-Thomas), in N. Sacramento Avenue (Thomas-Augusta), in N. Richmond Street (Division- Augusta), and in W. Cortez Street (Sacramento-California).  The old water main dates back to 1887,  and needs to be replaced.

By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.

To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you,  our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing a new sewer in N. Leclaire Avenue, from W. Belmont Avenue  to W. Wellington Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1914, and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Reboyras’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.

That’s the year the old sewer main was  installed beneath your street. Among other things:         BABE RUTH               Fettuccini Alfredo was first created in 1914 by Alfred Di Lelio. The dish supposedly   helped restore the appetite of his wife after she gave birth to their son.     Baseball legend Babe Ruth made his major league debut with the Boston Red Sox.    The first ship passed through the Panama Canal.    W. H. Carrier patented the air conditioner.    Congress established Mother’s Day.    The first traffic light was installed, at the intersection of Euclid Avenue and East 105th   Street, in Cleveland.     The U.S. Post Office began using automobiles to collect and deliver mail.                               PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will be installing a new sewer in N. Leclaire  Avenue, from W. Belmont Avenue to W. Wellington Avenue.     Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1914 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by  Belmont on the north, Wellington on the south, Lavergne on the east, and Laramie on the west  will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work begins shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in September. Restoration  of the damaged streets/parkways will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other  factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Leclaire outside of our working hours.  When we are  working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able  to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only. In addition, westbound Belmont will  be closed to thru traffic for approximately one week while we are connecting the new sewer to  the existing sewer. Westbound traffic will be detoured via Cicero - Addison - Central.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.             CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN ARIEL REBOYRAS   773-794-3095      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Reboyras, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.

WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 4,983 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Rockwell Street, from W. Lawrence Avenue to W. Montrose Avenue, and W.  Eastwood Avenue, from N. Virginia Avenue to N. Western Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1906 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in mid January 2015. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Rockwell Street and W. Eastwood Avenue outside  of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for  reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means  putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic  only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                    CONTACT NUMBERS   ALDERMAN JAMES CAPPLEMAN   773-878-4646                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in mid  January 2015. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

By	mid	May	2017,	Department	of	Water	Management	(DWM)	and	NPL	Construction	Company	 crews	will	begin	the	work	to	install	3,356	feet	of	new	12‐inch	water	main	in	N.	Cicero	Avenue,	from	 W.	Addison	Street	to	W.	Belmont	Avenue.	The	old	water	main	dates	back	to	1908,	and	needs	to	be	 replaced.		 	If	you	would	like	to	receive	regular	email	updates	about	the	progress	of	the	project,	please	go	to	 BuildingANewChicago.org	to	register	for	the	WaterALERT	program.		Simply	enter	your	name,	 email	address	and	the	project	identification	number	at	the	top	of	this	letter.	 	By	signing	up	for	the	WaterALERT	emails,	you	will	be	notified	as	the	project	enters	each	new	 construction	phase	–	from	our	mobilization	of	equipment	onto	the	site,	to	the	installation	of	new	 pipes,	to	the	final	restoration	of	the	street.	 	When	we	are	working	in	the	street,	we	may	close	or	limit	it	to	traffic	for	safety	reasons,	but	you	will	 always	be	able	to	reach	your	home	or	business.		Outside	of	working	hours,	a	travel	lane	will	be	left	 open	for	local	traffic	only.		 	We	will	post	our	work	area	for	“No	Parking”	as	needed	during	work	hours	(generally	7am‐4pm).

We	give	you	24‐hour	notice	when	this	is	to	happen.		However,	in	the	event	of	an	emergency	 shutdown	during	construction,	we	may	not	be	able	to	give	you	prior	warning.	 	Now	that	your	old	water	main	has	been	replaced	and	your	water	service	has	been	connected	to	the	 new	water	main,	it	is	important	to	flush	your	plumbing	of	any	sediment,	rust	or	metals,	including	 any	lead	to	maintain	water	quality.			 	Sediment,	rust	and	metals,	including	any	lead	may	collect	in	the	aerator	screen	located	at	the	tip	of	 your	faucets.		These	screens	should	be	removed	prior	to	flushing.

Fully	open	the	cold	water	tap	and	let	 the	water	run	for	at	least	5	minutes.		Next	flush	any	 other	cold	water	faucets	on	that	floor	for	at	least	5	 minutes.

Indicator Description   This indicator describes trends in the annual length of pollen season for ragweed (Ambrosia species) at  11 North American sites from 1995 to 2015. In general, by leading to more frost-free days and warmer  seasonal air temperatures, climate change can contribute to shifts in flowering time and pollen initiation  from allergenic plant species, and increased carbon dioxide concentrations alone can elevate the  production of plant-based allergens (Melillo et al., 2014). In the case of ragweed, the pollen season  begins with the shift to shorter daylight after the summer solstice, and it ends in response to cold  weather in the fall (i.e., first frost). These constraints suggest that the length of ragweed pollen season is  sensitive to climate change by way of changes to fall temperatures. Because allergies are a major public  health concern, observed changes in the length of the ragweed pollen season over time provide insight  into ways in which climate change may affect human well-being.    2.  Revision History   Indicator published.  Updated indicator with data through 2013.  Updated indicator with data through 2015.   December 2012:     May 2014:   August 2016:      Data Sources   3.  Data Sources   Data for this indicator come from the National Allergy Bureau. As a part of the American Academy of  Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology's (AAAAI’s) Aeroallergen Network, the National Allergy Bureau  collects pollen data from dozens of stations around the United States. Canadian pollen data originate  from Aerobiology Research Laboratories. The data were compiled and analyzed for this indicator by a  team of researchers who published a more detailed version of this analysis in 2011, based on data  through 2009 (Ziska et al., 2011).    4.  Data Availability   EPA acquired data for this indicator from Dr. Lewis Ziska of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,  Agricultural Research Service. Dr. Ziska was the lead author of the original analysis published in 2011  (Ziska et al., 2011). He provided an updated version for EPA’s indicator, with data through 2015.    Users can access daily ragweed pollen records for each individual U.S. pollen station on the National  Allergy Bureau’s website at: www.aaaai.org/global/nab-pollen-counts. Ambrosia spp. is classified as a  “weed” by the National Allergy Bureau and appears in its records accordingly. Canadian pollen data are  not publicly available, but can be purchased from Aerobiology Research Laboratories at:  www.aerobiology.ca/products/historical-data.   Technical Documentation: Ragweed Pollen Season   1   Methodology   5.  Data Collection   This indicator is based on daily pollen counts from 11 long-term sampling stations in central North  America. Nine sites were in the United States; two sites were in Canada. Sites were selected based on  availability of pollen data and nearby weather data (as part of a broader analysis of causal factors) and  to represent a variety of latitudes along a roughly north-south transect. Sites were also selected for  consistency of elevation and other locational variables that might influence pollen counts.    Table TD-1 identifies the station locations and the years of data available from each station.     Table TD-1.

Samples were collected using one of  three methods at each counting station:     1991  1979   2015  2015   1.  Slide gathering: Blank slides with an adhesive are left exposed to outdoor air to collect airborne   samples.    2.  Rotation impaction aeroallergen sampler: An automated, motorized device that spins air of a   known volume such that airborne particles adhere to a surrounding collection surface.   3.  Automated spore sampler from Burkard Scientific: A device that couples a vacuum pump and a   sealed rolling tumbler of adhesive paper in a way that records spore samples over time.   Despite differences in sample collection, all sites rely on the human eye to identify and count spores on  microscope slides. All of these measurement methods follow standard peer-reviewed protocols. The   Technical Documentation: Ragweed Pollen Season   2   resulting data sets from AAAAI and Aerobiology Research Laboratories have supported a variety of peer- reviewed studies. Although the sample collection methodologies do not allow for a comparison of total  pollen counts across stations that used different methods, the methods are equally sensitive to the  appearance of a particular pollen species.    6.   Indicator Derivation   By reviewing daily ragweed pollen counts over an entire season, analysts established start and end dates  for each location as follows:     •  The start date is the point at which 1 percent of the cumulative pollen count for the season has   been observed, meaning 99 percent of all ragweed pollen appears after this day.   •  The end date is the point at which 99 percent of the cumulative pollen count for the season has   been observed.     The duration of pollen season is simply the length of time between the start date and end date.    Two environmental parameters constrain the data used in calculating the length of ragweed season. As  a short-day plant, ragweed will not flower before the summer solstice. Furthermore, ragweed is  sensitive to frost and will not continue flowering once temperatures dip below freezing (Deen et al.,  1998). Because of these two biological constraints, ragweed pollen identified before June 21 or after the  first fall frost (based on local weather data) was not included in the analysis.    Once the start date, end date, and total length of the pollen season were determined for each year and  location, best-fit regression lines were calculated from all years of available data at each location. Thus,  the longer the data record, the more observations that were available to feed into the trend calculation.  Next, the regression coefficients were used to define the length of the pollen season at each station in  1995 and 2015. Figure 1 shows the difference between the 2015 season length and the 1995 season  length that were calculated using this method.    Ziska et al. (2011) present these analytical methods and describe them in greater detail.    7.  Quality Assurance and Quality Control   Pollen counts are determined by trained individuals who follow standard protocols, including  procedures for quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC). To be certified as a pollen counter, one  must meet various quality standards for sampling and counting proficiency.    Analysis   8.  Comparability Over Time and Space   Different stations use different sampling methods, so absolute pollen counts are not comparable across  stations. Because all of the methods are consistent in how they identify the start and end of the pollen  season, however, the season’s length data are considered comparable over time and from station to  station.     Technical Documentation: Ragweed Pollen Season   3   9.  Data Limitations   Factors that may impact the confidence, application, or conclusions drawn from this indicator are as  follows:     1.  This indicator focuses on only 11 stations in the central part of North America. Although dozens  of other stations across the country collect pollen data, they use a variety of methods, and their  data are not all readily available; stations are run by a wide variety of organizations, and only  some of them report their data to the National Allergy Bureau. Thus, the scientists who  developed the analysis for this indicator chose to make it a focused study, using a subset of  stations near one longitudinal transect. The impacts of climate change on ragweed growth and  pollen production could vary in other regions, such as coastal or mountainous areas.   2.  This indicator does not describe the extent to which the intensity of ragweed pollen season (i.e.,   pollen counts) may also be changing.   3.  The indicator is sensitive to other factors aside from weather, including the distribution of plant   species as well as pests or diseases that impact ragweed or competing species.   4.  Although some stations have pollen data dating back to the 1970s, this indicator characterizes  trends only from 1995 to 2015, based on data availability for the majority of the stations in the  analysis.   10.  Sources of Uncertainty   Error bars for the calculated start and end dates for the pollen season at each site were included in the  data set that was provided to EPA for the original version of this indicator, which EPA published in 2012.  Identification of the ragweed pollen season start and end dates may be affected by a number of factors,  both human and environmental. For stations using optical identification of ragweed samples, the  technicians evaluating the slide samples are subject to human error. Further discussion of error and  uncertainty can be found in Ziska et al. (2011).    11.  Sources of Variability   Wind and rain may impact the apparent ragweed season length. Consistently windy conditions could  keep pollen particles airborne for longer periods of time, thereby extending the apparent season length.  Strong winds could also carry ragweed pollen long distances from environments with more favorable  growing conditions. In contrast, rainy conditions have a tendency to draw pollen out of the air. Extended  periods of rain late in the season could prevent what would otherwise be airborne pollen from being  identified and recorded.    12.  Statistical/Trend Analysis   The indicator relies on a best-fit regression line for each sampling station to determine the change in  ragweed pollen season. Trends in season length over the full period of record were deemed to be  statistically significant to a 95-percent level (p < 0.05) at seven of the 11 stations, based on ordinary  least-squares regression: Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Minneapolis, Minnesota; La   Technical Documentation: Ragweed Pollen Season   4   Crosse, Wisconsin; Madison, Wisconsin; Papillion/Bellevue, Nebraska; and Kansas City, Missouri.

By	late	January	2018,	Department	of	Water	Management	(DWM)	and	Benchmark	Construction	 Company	crews	will	begin	the	work	to	install	4,384	feet	of	new	12‐inch	water	main	in	S.	Damen	 Avenue,	from	W.	63rd	Street	to	W.	69th	Place	and	W.	65th	Street,	from	S.	Damen	Avenue	to	S.	Wolcott	 Avenue.	The	old	water	main	dates	back	to	1890,	and	needs	to	be	replaced.	We	expect	all	work	to	be	 completed	by	late	May	2018.	This	includes	restoration.	Dates	may	change	depending	on	weather	 and	other	factors.	 	If	you	would	like	to	receive	regular	email	updates	about	the	progress	of	the	project,	please	go	to	 BuildingANewChicago.org	to	register	for	the	WaterALERT	program.		Simply	enter	your	name,	 email	address	and	the	project	identification	number	at	the	top	of	this	letter.	 	By	signing	up	for	the	WaterALERT	emails,	you	will	be	notified	as	the	project	enters	each	new	 construction	phase	–	from	our	mobilization	of	equipment	onto	the	site,	to	the	installation	of	new	 pipes,	to	the	final	restoration	of	the	street.	 	When	we	are	working	in	the	street,	we	may	close	or	limit	it	to	traffic	for	safety	reasons,	but	you	will	 always	be	able	to	reach	your	home	or	business.		Outside	of	working	hours,	a	travel	lane	will	be	left	 open	for	local	traffic	only.		 	We	will	post	our	work	area	for	“No	Parking”	as	needed	during	work	hours	(generally	7am‐4pm).		 Parking	outside	of	those	hours	will	be	allowed,	but	cars	will	need	to	be	moved	by	the	start	of	the	 next	workday.		We	will	try	to	preserve	as	much	parking	space	as	possible.	 	We	know	that	construction	always	involves	inconveniences	and	noise.	We	will	do	everything	 possible	to	maintain	your	quality	of	life	throughout	these	projects,	and	conducting	ourselves	as	 good	and	thoughtful	neighbors	in	the	course	of	our	presence	on	your	street.		 	Should	you	have	any	questions	or	concerns,	you	can	either	ask	the	construction	foreman	during	the	 project,	or	call	any	of	the	following	numbers:	 	   24‐Hour	City	Service	and	Information	Line:		311	   17th	Ward	Office:	773‐783‐3672	   DWM	Office	of	Public	Affairs:		312‐744‐6635	     Genwmnot03032016   	 Flushing	after	Your	Service	Line	has	been	Connected	to	the	New	Water	Main		  When	we	switch	over	the	services	from	the	old	main	to	the	new	water	main,	we	will	interrupt	water	 service.		We	give	you	24‐hour	notice	when	this	is	to	happen.		However,	in	the	event	of	an	emergency	 shutdown	during	construction,	we	may	not	be	able	to	give	you	prior	warning.	 	Now	that	your	old	water	main	has	been	replaced	and	your	water	service	has	been	connected	to	the	 new	water	main,	it	is	important	to	flush	your	plumbing	of	any	sediment,	rust	or	metals,	including	 any	lead	to	maintain	water	quality.			 	Sediment,	rust	and	metals,	including	any	lead	may	collect	in	the	aerator	screen	located	at	the	tip	of	 your	faucets.		These	screens	should	be	removed	prior	to	flushing.	 (1)	Please	find	the	closest	available	tap	(an	outside	 hose	spigot,	laundry	sink	faucet	or	bathtub)	to	where	 the	water	comes	into	the	home	that	is	not	used	for	 drinking	water.	Fully	open	the	cold	water	tap	and	let	 the	water	run	for	at	least	5	minutes.		Next	flush	any	 other	cold	water	faucets	on	that	floor	for	at	least	5	 minutes.		 (2)Move	to	the	next	highest	floor	and	repeat.	 (3)	Move	to	additional	floors	in	sequence	and	flush									 any	taps	or	faucets	for	at	least	5	minutes.		 			If	you	have	any	questions	or	concerns	about	your	water	quality,	or	if	you	would	like	your	water	 tested,	please	call	us	at	311.		For	additional	advice	and	information	visit	 http://www.epa.gov/il/advice‐chicago‐residents‐about‐lead‐drinking‐water.	 	 If	your	water	line	has	been	idle	or	stagnant	for	more	than	6‐hours,	it	is	advised	that	you	flush	for	at	 least	5	minutes	to	maintain	water	quality.		This	may	include	flushing	the	toilet,	taking	a	shower	and	 doing	laundry.			 	 Lastly,	if	you	don’t	already	have	one,	I	ask	you	to	consider	the	installation	of	a	water	meter	in	your	 home	to	help	you	save	money	on	your	water	bill.			For	more	information	on	this	free	program,	go	to	 www.metersave.org.	 	Thank	you	in	advance	for	your	patience	and	cooperation	during	this	important	infrastructure	 improvement	project.

As you know, the OEMC oversees a number of core functions that support citywide operations  and the overall safety of first responders,  residents and visitors to Chicago.  Most notably, the  OEMC  manages  the  9-1-1  Operations  Call  Center,  the  3-1-1  City  Services  Call  Center, the  Office of Emergency Management (or OEM), the civilian Traffic Management Authority and the  Public Safety Information Technology needs that support our first responders.  Many of you are  also familiar with our role in providing public safety planning and coordination across the City’s  wide array of partners.  This planning and coordination role includes everything from weekend  special events to homeland security related responsibilities.       In short – the OEMC has a diverse mission that supports the communications and coordination  needs of all our public safety partners.    Over the past  year, the  OEMC has expanded our role in providing civilian support for public  safety  first  responders.  This  year, our  Traffic  Management  Authority  absorbed  the  oversight  of school Crossing Guards, ensuring the safety of our children going to and from school. Another  significant  addition  to  the  OEMC’s  workforce  was  the  civilianization  of  the  City’s  Alternate  Response  Section.  The  Alternate  Response  Section  now  is  staffed  with  a  largely  civilian  workforce  of  OEMC  Police  Communications  Operators  (PCO  I).  This  move  supports  CPD’s  goal  of  putting  more  sworn  officers  back  on  the  beat  and  further  reinforces  the  capability  for  ARS to serve as a backup to 9-1-1 call-taking during extreme surges or in times of large scale  emergencies.     In 2016, OEMC made substantial improvements to its training for 9-1-1 Operations staff.  We  took a hard look at our training requirements with a focus on strengthening service. As a result,  new  extensive  retraining  efforts  were  implemented.  Those  efforts  include  Crisis  Intervention  Training to better respond to the calls involving mental health incidents and courtesy training to  enhance  our  staff's  skills  and  professionalism.  This  effort  has  also  resulted  in  increased  supervisor monitoring for call takers and dispatchers.      While  we  continue  to  strive  for  process  improvement  and  customer  service  satisfaction,  I  am  pleased to announce that the City of Chicago’s 9-1-1 staff has received National and State level  accolades  from  the  Association  of  Public-Safety  Communications  Officials.  This  industry   organization has awarded one of our very own as the “International Trainer of the Year” as well  as “Illinois Trainer of the Year.” This recognition highlights not only this individual’s efforts, but  the team efforts as well.      Working in partnership with DoIT and actively engaging stakeholders, we will meet the Mayor’s  vision to modernize the now 17 year old 3-1-1 technology.  Our goal is to provide convenient,  user-friendly access for residents to connect, communicate and collaborate with the City.  This  project will streamline work flow, allow for improved service delivery and tracking while also  improving  the reporting  capabilities.    All  of  these  goals  are  in  line  with  the  Mayor’s  mission  of transparency and accountability.       As always, we continue working to realize efficiencies and cost saving measures.  To this end,  OEMC was  able  to  minimize  the  increase  to  our  corporate  budget  by  utilizing  zero  based  budgeting.  This approach has meant better coordination of our Homeland Security Grant funds  to purchase and maintain new projects, software applications, and equipment.  OEMC also has  taken steps to realize significant cost savings with regard to technology.  In September, OEMC  completed several database migrations to new Dell hardware supporting 9-1-1 Operations. This  move  from  older,  expensive  legacy  hardware  will  not  only  strengthen  our  back-end  dependability  for  9-1-1  Operations  but  also  will  produce  an  estimated  $5  million  dollars  in  savings for maintenance over the next five years.         In my first few months on the job, I have seen that we have a tremendous workforce of talented  people at the OEMC and an impressive array of partnerships all committed to supporting public  safety. I look forward to continuing to assess opportunities that will strengthen this organization  and help us better meet our important mission of serving the residents and visitors to Chicago.      Again,  thank  you  Madam  Chairman  and  members  of  City  Council  and  I  look  forward  to  answering any of your questions.

Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016      Good morning Chairman Austin, Vice Chairman Ervin, members of the Committee on Budget  and Government Operations and members of the City Council. I would like to thank you for the  opportunity  to  present  to  you  the  2017  Budget  proposal  for  the  Department  of  Water  Management (DWM).       Our  mission  is  to  ensure  the  health  of  the  public  in  the  most  environmentally  and  fiscally  responsible  manner  by delivering  a  sufficient  supply  of quality  water  and  efficiently  managing  waste and stormwater.       Through our operations at the Jardine and Sawyer Water Purification Plants – the two largest  conventional  treatment  plants  in  the  world  –  DWM  purifies,  on  average,  about  800  million  gallons of water a day.  We also operate 12 pumping stations that distribute water through more  than  4,400  miles  of  water  mains.    On  the  sewer  side,  the  department  is  responsible  for  transmission of wastewater through more than 4,400 miles of sewer mains to the Metropolitan  Water Reclamation District.        We  provide  purified  water  to  more  than  2.7  million  customers  in  Chicago  and  2.67  million  customers in 125 surrounding suburbs.  On a daily basis, more than 5.3 million customers, or 42  percent of the Illinois population, depend on our infrastructure for clean, safe drinking water.        Since my confirmation in May, we have continued to meet our goals of Mayor Emanuel’s 10- year  capital  program,  now  almost  at  the  halfway  mark.    In  June,  we  hosted  ACE16  -  the  American  Water  Works  Association’s  Annual  Conference  and  Exposition  -  where  more  than  14,000 water professionals gathered to learn from one another.  At the conference I explained  why every time they went from point A to point B, whether to dinner, the airport or sightseeing,  their route might be slowed due to our construction.  We have been in every ward over the last  five  years  either  replacing  water  mains  or  sewer  mains  or  lining  structures  and  sewers.  Our  crews are hard at work to upgrade our aging infrastructure to ensure we won't have to be back  again for decades. Further, every dollar spent improving our infrastructure puts people to work,  which is a tangible benefit to our residents and our communities.        Today,  we  continue to  actively  move  closer  to  reaching  our goals  established  in  2011,  which  include:    •  Replacing 880 miles of water mains;  •  Replacing 250 miles of sewer mains;   Page -1-      Department of Water Management    2017 Budget Hearing   Remarks of Barrett B. Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016   •  Lining  more  than  470  miles  of  sewers  and  140,000  sewer  structures  to  extend  their   useful life; and   •  Converting three pumping stations from steam to electric power.      I could not be prouder of the men and women who work for the Department, helping each day to  make  our  plans  a  reality.  In  the  last  four  years  we  have  hired  or  promoted  more  than  700  employees.  Throughout  training  and  professional  development to ensure the safe and efficient execution of the capital plan.    the  Department,  we  ensure  proper      The  ability  to  provide  quality,  cost-effective  and  reliable  services  requires  a  multi-faceted  administrative effort.  That includes: incorporating facility assessments; working with the various  labor unions to achieve work rule compliance; executing competitive contracts; coordinating with  other agencies, utilities and departments; and implementing traditional and alternative funding to  avoid overburdening future generations.       We  constantly  coordinate  with  other  departments,  with  your  ward  staff,  utilities  and  other  agencies  to  identify  opportunities  for  collaboration.  The  use  of  the  latest  mapping  and  scheduling  technology,  as  well  as  monthly  coordination  meetings  between  departments  and  utilities, has contributed to an accelerated and more efficient and cost-effective program.        Earlier  this  year,  the  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  highlighted  our  Department  as  a  success story, saying that, ""In 2014, investments by … the CDWM generated nearly 20,000  total  jobs,  including  more  than  10,000  direct  construction,  water,  and  sewage  jobs…  increased regional economic output by almost $2 billion over the year.”       Infrastructure  investments  are  a  win-win  for  Chicago  and  Illinois.  The  investments  improve  environmental  quality  for  households  and  businesses;  provide  middle-class  employment  for  construction workers & the employees of water facilities; preserves our most precious resource;  and ripples into other sectors of the economy.      We  continue  to  improve  operations  and  maintenance,  which  includes  addressing  emergency  repairs and other calls for service. Work orders are being completed and closed more quickly,  resulting in a decreased backlog. In the areas of leaks and breaks, no water, water in basement,  catch basin repair requests and sewer cave-ins, our response times are down as well, as are  the number of open service requests. This increased productivity is due to the hard work of our  men and women in the field, the reduction in water main breaks and collapsed sewers due to  capital work, and by holding crews accountable to do their work efficiently and safely.    Page -2-      Department of Water Management    2017 Budget Hearing   Remarks of Barrett B. Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016      The  MeterSave  Program  is  an  important  program  that  saves  water,  and  at  the  same  time,  it  saves our customers money. This year, we will exceed our installation goal of 15,000 meters.  The only way to know exactly how much water someone is using is to measure it.  With more  awareness of water use, we will all become better stewards of this great natural resource. Word  of mouth is our best marketing tool and we truly appreciate you and your staff’s assistance in  this effort as we continue to promote installation of water meters for all properties.      In 2017, our administrative goals remain the same: reform and improve where we can; cut, or  amend our approach where we must; and invest where it matters. Our construction targets for  2017 will include:   •  90 miles of water main installation  •  15,000 MeterSave meter installations  •  29 miles of sewer main installation  •  52 miles of sewer main lining  •  14,000 structure linings      At the end of our 10-year program, DWM will have invested nearly $7 billion in the improvement  of our water and sewer systems.  As Commissioner of the Department of Water Management, I  pledge to continue to work with each of you as we look at the service needs in your wards to  make the improvements necessary to maintain and improve quality of life. I am committed to  remaining  accessible  and  improving  communications  between  our  Department  and  you  and  your staff.       We  have  accomplished  much  in  2016,  and  I  look  forward  to  continuing  to  deliver  the  best  possible services to the residents of Chicago next year. Together, we will ensure that Chicago’s  water and sewer system provides high-quality service to all of our customers.       Thank you.         Page -3-      "

Currently, the risk of influenza infection is high.  Vaccination is the best way to protect against influenza infection  and all Chicagoans aged six months and older are encouraged to get vaccinated.  Chicagoans should ask their  healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  For those without a healthcare provider or whose  healthcare providers do not have the influenza  vaccine, a list of City of Chicago Fast-Track Immunization Clinics1  is available on the City website and by calling 311.  To locate the closest City of Chicago clinic or retail pharmacy,  go to www.chicagoflushots.org.     Figure 1. Number of influenza-associated intensive care unit   hospitalizations reported for Chicago residents, for current season  (2015-2016) and previous season (2014-2015), October-May.   Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has is- sued influenza testing and reporting recommendations2 .   Suspected novel and variant influenza, pediatric influen- za-associated deaths, influenza-associated ICU hospitali- zations and outbreaks of influenza-like illness in a con- gregate setting should all be reported to CDPH via IN- EDSS3.  For the week of March 13-19, 2016 (week 11),  18 influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were report- ed (Figure 1).      Since October 4, 2015, 220 influenza-associated ICU  hospitalizations have been reported; 216 were positive  for influenza A (7 H3N2, 118 (H1N1)pdm09 and 91 un- known subtype [subtyping not attempted or not all sub- types tested]) and 4 was positive for influenza B.  One  hundred fifteen (52%) were non-Hispanic Black, 124  (56%) were male, and 128 (58%) were 50 years of age or  older (median age of 54 years with a range of 3 months- 99 years).  Sixty-eight (31%) had reported lung disease  (e.g.  asthma, COPD), 56 (25%) had active cardiac dis- ease and 64 (29%) required ventilator support.  Sixteen  deaths were reported among ICU admissions.  Five out- breaks consisting of two or more confirmed cases of in- fluenza were reported in long-term care facilities.      How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   CDPH receives data from influenza surveillance sites  across Chicago, which report the total number of patient  visits seen weekly, and of those visits, the number with  influenza-like illness (ILI) (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater,  with cough or sore throat).  All hospitals in Chicago that  provide emergent care are required to report on a weekly  basis the total number of emergency department visits,  and of those visits, the number with ILI.  For the week of  March 13-19, 2016 with 10 hospitals reporting, 4.8% of  emergency department visits were due to ILI (Figure 2).      ESSENCE is an electronic syndromic surveillance system that utilizes emergency department chief complaint data sub- mitted daily by participating Chicago hospitals.  ILI activity is determined solely based on the patient’s chief complaint  and does not take into account the entire medical record, as the ILI activity reported in Figure 2 does.  Currently, 10 Chi- cago hospitals submit data to ESSENCE.  For the week of March 13-19, 2016, 2.4% of emergency department visits    were due to ILI (Figure 3).       Figure 2.

Figure 5. Percent of specimens testing positive (by RT-PCR) for  influenza by subtype as reported by local laboratories serving  Chicago hospitals, for the current season (2015-2016) October- May.         Several outpatient clinics throughout Chicago participate  in CDC’s Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network  (ILINet) by reporting on the number of patients with ILI  seen weekly.  From March 6-12, 2016, with 24 facilities  reporting, 5.9% of visits were due to influenza-like ill- ness (Figure 4).      Which influenza strains are circulating?   Data on influenza virus test results are reported by Chica- go laboratories performing influenza subtyping. For the  week of  March 13-19, 2016, with 6 laboratories report- ing, 125 of the 860 (14%) specimens tested for influenza  were positive (88 A (H1N1)pdm09, 5 A (H3N2), 25 A  [unknown subtype] and 7 influenza B).  Since October 4,  2015, 1,257 of 15,018 (8%) specimens tested for influen- za have been positive; 1,203 typed as influenza A (32  H3N2, 963 (H1N1)pdm09, 208 unknown subtype  [subtyping not attempted or not all subtypes tested]) and  54 were typed as influenza B (Figure 5).

Daley, Mayor      April 16, 2010   Chicago Department of Public Health  Bechara Choucair, MD, Commissioner   Figure 1. Reported number of hospitalizations associated with  confirmed or presumptive pandemic influenza A (H1N1), Chicago,  by week of specimen collection, April 2009—April 2010     What is the risk?  As of April 16, 2010, the risk of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection in Chicago remains low. Despite several  months of minimal influenza activity, the Board of Health’s Emergency Reporting Requirement1 is still in effect  for Chicago hospitals, as well as for Chicago laboratories performing influenza subtyping tests.  All Chicagoans  aged six months and older are encouraged to protect themselves from infection by getting vaccinated with the pan- demic influenza vaccine. Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.   For those without healthcare providers or whose healthcare providers do not have vaccine, vaccines are available at  City of Chicago Fast Track Immunization clinics  and neighborhood health centers; hours and loca- tions are available by calling 311.    Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   No hospitalizations associated with pandemic in- fluenza A (H1N1) have been reported in Chicago  residents for surveillance week 14 (April 4 – April  10, 2010) (figure 1).     How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   With 15 Chicago hospitals reporting, 3.2% of  emergency department visits were due to influ- enza-like illness (i.e. fever of 100°F or greater,  with cough or sore throat). In both pediatric hos- pitals and hospitals serving adults, rates have de- creased to the levels that were reported in Sep- tember 2009 (figure 2). Among four outpatient  clinics reporting for the week of April 4 – April  10, 2010, 1.0% of doctor’s office visits were due  to influenza-like illness.  This level of activity is  lower than levels seen during the same surveil- lance week during previous influenza seasons.    Which influenza strains are circulating?   For the week of April 4 – April 10, 2010, with  seven local laboratories reporting, five influenza  A-positive specimens for which subtyping was  performed were reported as presumptive pan- demic influenza A (H1N1).  No seasonal influ- enza A or influenza B strains were reported.     Where can I get more information?        The February edition of CDPH’s CD Info newsletter2 provides supplemental information about the surveillance and  investigation of the 2009 pandemic in Chicago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s FluView3 report  provides national updates and trends related to the intensity of influenza activity across the United States, as well as  detailed information on antiviral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics.

The department has seen an increase in cases of confirmed canine distemper virus found in raccoons tested  after displaying abnormal neurologic signs.   The surveillance program for wildlife diseases in Cook County monitors rabies infection and other zoonotic  diseases in wildlife and it also detects trends in diseases that can be spread to companion animals, said Dr.  Donna Alexander, Administrator of the Cook County Department of Animal and Rabies Control.   “This year, 56 percent of raccoons that have been necropsied have been positive for the canine distemper  virus. This exceeds the 46 percent experienced in 2004, the last year of a distemper epidemic in pet dogs in  Cook County,” Alexander said. “The canine distemper virus occurs in the raccoon and coyote population to  varying degrees, and we believe that the numbers we have received so far this year warrant a precautionary  warning.”   The distemper virus affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous system of dogs. Symptoms can  include ocular and nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors  and seizures. Death can occur from secondary pneumonia or non-responsive seizure activity.   Pet owners should vaccinate their dogs and all dogs should be supervised while outside, even in a fenced-in  yard, to prevent contact with wild animals, Alexander said.   Additionally, some cases of the canine influenza virus have been reported in the County. As of Feb. 2, 2016,  16 cases have been confirmed in Cook County.   Last year, an outbreak of the canine flu in the region killed at least 11 dogs.   “In January and February of 2015, we had reports from veterinarians throughout the County of an increase in  canine infectious respiratory disease,” Alexander said. “The identification of the flu strain H3N2 as the culprit of  the increased severity of canine respiratory disease and deaths was not made until late March and early April.  We are testing and identifying H3N2 in many cases so far this year and pet owners should take action.”   Precautions recommended by the Alexander and the veterinary community include:     Keep all pets vaccinated against core diseases and secure additional vaccines based on the animal’s   lifestyle. See your veterinarian as to his/her recommendations for your pet. Some vaccines are required  by law.     Social events for dogs such as dog-friendly areas, training classes, grooming and boarding should be   visited with caution. Communicable diseases are transmitted through close association with other  animals. Make sure that your pet is vaccinated and that the pets involved are equally protected.  Minimize social activities with your pets and pets of unknown vaccination or health history.     Visit your veterinarian at least twice per year for health reviews including recommendations on vaccines   and intestinal parasite checks. Animals that are most susceptible to the viruses are those that are  immune-compromised by age or other illness.

Ang pagsasagawa ng aksiyon para  makaiwas ang pinakamahusay na paraan upang manatiling ligtas mula sa malulubhang panganib sa  kalusugang kaugnay sa panahon ng taglamig. Kasama sa pilas ng katotohanan (fact sheet) na ito ang mga  tip para tulungan kang maghanda para sa matinding lamig.    Paano ko mapangangalagaan ang aking sarili mula sa mga panganib ng matinding lamig?        Iwasan ang mga hindi kinakailangang biyahe sa labas. Kung makapaghihintay ang gawain  hanggang sa mas uminit ang panahon, hayaang maghintay ito.     Kung lalabas ka sa lamig, limitahan ang panahong mananatili ka sa labas. Hati-hatiin ang mas   mahahabang gawain sa mas maiikli, na may mga panahon ng pagpapahinga sa loob ng bahay sa  pagitan. Huwag hahayaan ang mga batang maglaro sa labas nang matagal.     Magsuot ng ilang patong ng maluwag, mainit na damit.    Bigyan ng espesyal na pansin na mapanatiling mainit ang iyong ulo, mga tainga, kamay at paa.   Magsuot ng sumbrero, bandana, guwantes, makakapal na medyas at mga botang pangtaglamig.  Manatiling tuyo para matulungan ang mga damit mo na panatilihin kang mas mainit.     Bigyan ng karagdagang pansin ang mga pang-araw-araw na pangangailangan ng iyong katawan.   Matulog nang sapat. Kumain ng mga pagkaing mataas sa enerhiya. Uminom ng maiinit na  inumin at sabaw upang tulungang panatilihing mainit ang yong katawan. Iwasan ang mga  inuming nakalalasing, na maaaring makasira sa iyong pagpapasiya. Pinalalaki din ng alak ang  mga daluyan ng dugo, na dahilan upang maging mas mabilis mawalan ng init ang katawan.     Ano ang maaari kong gawin sa bahay upang makapaghanda para sa matinding lamig?       Tiyakin na nasa tamang kaayusan ng paggana ang iyong pampainit (heat).    Hindi inirerekomenda ng Chicago Fire Department (CFD) ang paggamit ng mga space heater   bilang alternatibong mapagkukunan ng init.      Subaybayan ang iba't ibang lumalabas para sa mga update tungkol sa panahon (TV, Radio,   Emergency Alert System)     Magtabi nang kahit tatlong araw na dami ng inuming tubig at pagkaing de-lata/di-niluluto na   nakahanda.      Bumuo ng emergency kit na kinabibilangan ng mga ekstrang kumot, mga supply ng first aid at   gamot at isang flashlight na may mga reserbang baterya.     Huwag kalilimutan ang mga alagang hayop. Kahit ang mga aso at pusa ay kailangan ng tulong sa  pangangasiwa sa panahon ng taglamig. Ipasok sila sa loob ng bahay at siguraduhin na mayroon  silang tubig at mga kumot.      Paano ko ba matutulungan ang ibang na manatiling ligtas mula sa matinding lamig?     Magtabi ng listahan ng mga impormasyon sa pakikipag-ugnayan para sa mga kamag-anak,  kapitbahay at kaibigan, at tukuyin pareho ang pangunahin at mga alternatibong paraan ng  pakikipag-ugnayan sa bawat isa.      Kumustahin sila nang madalas, lalo na yaong matatanda, may kapansanan at/o namumuhay   mag-isa.     Alamin kung saan matatagpuan, at kung paano makikipag-ugnayan sa mga emergency service   provider tulad ng pulisya, bumbero, EMS at mga ospital.      Magtabi ng reserbang baterya at charger para sa mga mobile device.    Kung hindi ka komportableng tumingin sa isang tao, tumawag sa 311 upang humiling para sa   pagtingin ng kapakanan.      Kung wala kang access sa pampainit (heating), tumawag sa 311 para sa tulong. Maaari ka ring  pumunta sa isa sa mga sentrong painitan (warming center) ng Lungsod na matatagpuan sa  buong Chicago. Ang Garfield Center, ay matatagpuan sa 10 S. Kedzie Avenue, ay available 24  na oras sa isang araw, pitong araw sa isang linggo upang ikonekta ang mga naninirahan sa  emergency na silungan.

Description of Tax      Effective  January  1,  1992,  the  Chicago  Telecommunications  Tax  (Chicago  Municipal  Code  (“M.C.C.”)  chapter  3-70)  (hereafter  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  “Telecommunications  Tax”)    was  imposed  on  the  act  or  privilege  of  originating  or  receiving  telecommunications  in  the  city  of  Chicago  at  a  rate  of  5%  of  gross  charges.   Effective January 1, 1998, the Chicago Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance  Fee (M.C.C. chapter 3-75) (hereafter sometimes referred to as the “IMF”) was imposed  on  the  act  or  privilege  of  originating  or  receiving  telecommunications  in  the  city  of  Chicago  at  a  rate  of  2%  of  gross  charges.    Effective  January  1,  2003,  the  Chicago  Simplified Telecommunications Tax (M.C.C. chapter 3-73) (hereafter sometimes referred  to as “the Simplified Tax” or  “tax”) replaced the Telecommunications Tax and  the IMF.   The  rate  of  the  Simplified  Tax  is  7%  of  gross  charges.    In  general,  the  terms  of  the  Simplified Tax are essentially the same as those of the Telecommunications Tax.     The  tax  is  imposed  on  the  act  or  privilege  of  originating  or  receiving  telecommunications  in  the  city  of  Chicago.    The  tax  applies  to  both  intrastate  telecommunications (telecommunications that originate and terminate within the state of  Illinois)  and  interstate  telecommunications  (telecommunications  that  either  originate  or  terminate outside Illinois).  The tax rate is 7% of the gross charge for telecommunications  purchased at retail from a retailer.  (Municipal Code of Chicago, hereinafter “M.C.C.,” 3- 73-030.)  Every telecommunications retailer maintaining a place of business in Illinois,  which is subject to the jurisdiction of the city, must collect the tax from its customers  who originate or receive telecommunications in Chicago. (M.C.C., 3-73-040.)   Retailers  must register with the department of revenue (M.C.C., 3-73-060) and (in general, subject  to the provisions of M.C.C., 3-4-186, 3-4-187, 3-4-188 and 3-4-189) remit the tax to the  department on a monthly basis.  (M.C.C., 3-73-050.)  Retailers who remit the tax in a  timely manner may retain 1.0% of the tax collected to reimburse them for collection and  remittance expenses.  (M.C.C., 3-73-40(D).)        2.  Prepaid Telephone Calling Arrangements    Prepaid telephone calling arrangements are not considered telecommunications     subject to the Simplified Telecommunications Tax.  They are instead subject to state and  local sales taxes.  ""Prepaid telephone calling arrangements"" means the right to  exclusively purchase telephone or telecommunications services that must be paid for in  advance and enable the origination of one or more intrastate, interstate, or international  telephone calls or other telecommunications using an access number, an authorization   code, or both, whether manually or electronically dialed, for which payment to a retailer  must be made in advance, provided that, unless recharged, no further service is provided  once that prepaid amount of service has been consumed.  Prepaid telephone calling  arrangements include the recharge of a prepaid calling arrangement.  For purposes of this  Section, ""recharge"" means the purchase of additional prepaid telephone or  telecommunications services whether or not the purchaser acquires a different access  number or authorization code.  ""Prepaid telephone calling arrangement"" does not include  an arrangement whereby a customer purchases a payment card and pursuant to which the  service provider reflects the amount of the purchase as a credit on an account for a  customer under an existing subscription plan.          Meaning of “Gross Charge”   3.      The  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  is  imposed  upon  the  gross  charge for telecommunications.  (M.C.C., 3-73-030(A).)  The term “gross charge” means  the amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in  the city of Chicago and for all services provided in connection therewith by a retailer,  valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services  and property of every kind or nature. No deduction may be taken on account of the cost  of the telecommunications, the cost of materials used, labor or service cost or any other  expense whatsoever.  (M.C. C., 3-73-020(F).)  If a retailer provides services that are not  necessary  for,  or  directly  related  to,  the  retailer’s  provision  of  telecommunications  to  customers, and the charges for these services are disaggregated and separately identified  from  other  charges,  then  the  retailer  need  not  include  the  charges  in  gross  charges.   Examples of these services may include directory advertising, specialized designing or  engineering  services,  specialized  security  measures  and  consulting  services.    ""Gross  charges""  for  private  line  service  include  charges  imposed  at  each  channel  point  within  Illinois, charges for the channel mileage between each channel point within Illinois, and  charges for that portion of the interstate inter-office channel provided within Illinois.                4.   Customer Equipment Charges   Gross  charges  do  not  include  charges  for  customer  equipment  including  equipment  that  is  leased  or  rented  by  the  customer  from  any  source,  but  only  if  the  charges are disaggregated and separately identified from other charges. (M.C.C., 3-73- 020(F)(4).)    For  purposes  of  this  provision,  customer  equipment  includes,  but  is  not  limited to, all items generally classified as customer equipment or terminal equipment,  such  as  telephone  instruments  and  station  sets,  dialers,  modems,  private  branch  exchanges (PBX’s), inside wiring, facsimile machines and pagers.  Although charges for  customer equipment may not be subject to the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications  Tax, the lease or rental of customer equipment may be subject to the Chicago Personal  Property Lease Transaction Tax.  (M.C.C., chapter 3-32.)     5.  Computer-Related Charges     Charges for automated data storage, retrieval and processing services or for the  use of computer time or other equipment are not included in gross charges.  (M.C.C., 3- 73-020(F)(3).)  Automated information retrieval or data processing charges also are not  included in gross charges.  For example, customers who access on-line computer data  bases are subject to the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax on the charge for  the transmission of the data, but not on the charge for the data processing or inquiry.  If a  telecommunications retailer provides both transmission and data processing services,  however, the charge for the data processing services will be subject to the tax unless it is  disaggregated and separately identified on billing statements and in the books and records  of the retailer.  In addition, customers who access on-line computer data bases may be  subject to the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax.  (M.C.C., chapter 3-32;  Meites v. City of Chicago, 184 Ill.App.3d 887, 540 N.E.2d 973 (1st Dist. 1989).)     6.   Value-Added Services           Value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act   Generally, persons that provide customers access to the Internet (""Internet Service   on the form, content, code and protocol of information for purposes other than  transmission are not subject to the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax.   (M.C.C., 3-7 3-020(Q)(2).)  For example, charges for computer data, and protocol  conversions (permitting computers to exchange data, regardless of the language or  protocol a computer’s out-put may be in) are not subject to the tax.  To avoid taxation,  however, charges for these services must be disaggregated and separately stated.   Furthermore, charges for services that are provided for the purposes of transmission are  subject to the tax, even if the form, content, code or protocol of the information is acted  upon in the course of providing the services.  Thus, for example, charges for the service  commonly referred to as “Voice Over Internet Protocol” (or “VOIP”) are subject to the  tax.      Providers"" or ""ISPs"") and who do not, as part of that service, charge customers for the  line or other transmission charges that are used to obtain access to the ISP's server or  other point of access, are not considered to be telecommunications retailers from these  activities.  This is the case so long as such ISPs do not, as part of their billing, charge  customers for such line charges and instead pay their telecommunications suppliers all  transmission costs that they incur in providing the Internet service.  In this situation, an  ISP's customer pays his telecommunications supplier for all transmission costs incurred  while using the service.  The single monthly fee charged by the ISP, which often  represents a flat charge for a package of items including Internet access, e-mail, and  electronic newsletters, would generally not be subject to tax.  If, however, the ISP  charges customers for line or other transmission charges, then it should provide its  telecommunications suppliers with Certificates of Resale and should collect and remit the  tax.  For example, if an ISP provides customers with Internet access, as described in this  section, but also provides customers the use of a 1-800 service to access the ISP, and  separately assesses customers per minute charges for the use of the 1-800 service, then  the ISP is considered a telecommunications retailer and incurs telecommunications tax on   the charges made for the 1-800 service.  If the charges are not disaggregated as provided  in subsection (c), then all charges are subject to the telecommunications tax.     7.  Advertising Revenue   Gross  charges  do  not  include  advertising  revenue  either  from  directory  sales  (such as “yellow pages”) or from message additions to telecommunications. For example,  revenues from an advertising message preceding a time/weather call are not included in  gross charges.     8.  Certain Services Included in Gross Charges   Gross charges include, but are not limited to, charges for unlisted or unpublished  numbers, operator assistance, directory information, call-waiting, call-forwarding, burglar  alarm services and answering services provided by telecommunications retailers.     9.   “900” Numbers                                       The Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax applies to telephone calls made  to 900 numbers if the caller is located in Chicago and receives a billing at the caller’s  service address.  The telecommunications retailer, however, is required to collect the tax  only  upon  the  line  charge.    The  invoice  to  the  caller  for  a  900  number  call  need  not  separately  state  the  line  charge  and  tax.    For  example,  a  call  to  a  900  code  number  is  made to register an opinion in a poll. The caller is billed $1.00. The $0.80 transmission  charge  is  retained  by  the  telecommunications  retailer,  and  $0.20  is  given  to  the  poll  tabulator.  $0.80 is included in gross charges.     10.  Information and Entertainment Services   Gross charges include the transmission charges for information or entertainment  services  such  as  time/weather,  gab  line/party  line  and  other  public  announcement  services.  However, charges for the message content or information of these services are  not included in gross charges.     11 .  Persons Selling to Retailer’s Customers   a.   If a telecommunications retailer receives billing and collection fees  from  persons  selling  services  or  products  to  the  retailer’s  customers,  and  these  fees are billed and collected by the telecommunications retailer, the fees are not  included in gross charges.  For example, a call to a 900 code number is billed by  the telecommunications retailer as follows:    $25.00 - purchase price charged to   caller for product or service    $ 0.35 - call charge ($0.20 call, $0.15   billing and collection fee).   Only the $0.20 charged for the telephone call is included in gross charges and subject to  the tax.     b.   The  following  fees  also  are  not  included  in  gross  charges:    (i)  billing and collection fees paid by persons selling services or products directly to  a telecommunications retailer’s customers; and (ii) billing and collection fees paid  by  a  telecommunications  retailer  to  a  credit  card  company  whose  holders  have  charged calls.   12.  Other Taxes                               Gross  charges  do  not  include  the  taxes  imposed  by  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  Ordinance,  the  Illinois  Telecommunications  Excise  Tax  Act,  section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the charges imposed on consumers for 911  service.  (M.C.C., 3-73-020(F) (1).)         13.  Exemption for State Governments and Universities   The  exemption  for  state  governments  and  state  universities  created  by  statute  extends  only  to  telecommunications  they  purchase  for  their  own  use.  (M.C.C.,  3-73  - 020(N)(1).)  They are not exempt from the obligation to collect and remit tax on sales of  telecommunications  to  others  when  they  act  as  retailers  of  telecommunications.    For  example, a state university is exempt from the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications  Tax  on  purchases,  by  the  university,  of  telecommunications  for  use  by  its  faculty  and  staff in the course of their duties.  However, the university is required to collect and remit  tax on sales of telecommunications to students in university dormitories.     14.  Retailers and Resellers of Telecommunications   a.   Retailers  of  telecommunications  are  persons  who  engage  in  the  business of making sales of telecommunications at retail.  (M.C.C., 3-73-020(L),  (N).)  Telecommunications retailers include, but are not limited to, persons that  operate  or  provide  radio  repeater  services,  paging  services,  radio  dispatch  services, facsimile transmission services and party line services.   b.   of   are   Resellers   telecommunications   considered  telecommunications retailers and, therefore, are required to collect and remit the  Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax based upon the gross charges they  receive  for  telecommunications.    In  the  event  that  a  retailer  who  resells  telecommunications has paid the tax to a local exchange carrier or other retailer,  the reseller may make an application (including supporting documentation) to the  department for a credit memorandum.  Telecommunications resellers include, but  are not limited to, universities and hotels.    15.  Mobile Operations Reporting Option   a.     Retailers  of  telecommunications  who  provide  cellular  phone,  mobile radio, paging or other services, where the customer’s service address is in  fact not a fixed site but rather a motor vehicle or other mobile location, shall use  the customer’s place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications  Sourcing Conformity Act, Public Law 106-252, as amended from time to time,  which as of January 1, 2003 provides that the “place of primary use” means the  street  address  representative  of  where  the  customer’s  use  of  the  mobile  telecommunications service primarily occurs, and which further provides that this  means the residential street address or the primary business street address of the  customer within the licensed service area of the home service provider.  For air- to-ground  systems  and  the  like,  ""service  address""  shall  mean  the  location  of  a  taxpayer's  primary  use  of  the  telecommunications  equipment  as  defined  by  telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.  (M.C.C., 3-73--020(O).)     Retailers    should  not    apportion  gross  charges  based  upon  the  physical  location  of  a  mobile  portable  telecommunications  device  at  the  time  service  is  provided.  For  example,  a  retailer  providing  service  to  a    place  of  primary use in Chicago must collect Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax  on all telecommunications billed to  the customer.    16.  Interstate and International Telecommunications   b.   a.   Obligation of agents.  If a local exchange carrier acting as an agent   of a long distance carrier, inter-exchange carrier, alternative operator service or  billing and collections contractor (a) bills local customers for long distance  service, local service and the taxes applicable for those services and (b) remits a  portion of the collections to its principal, then the local exchange carrier or retailer  must remit tax to the department of revenue only for the amounts it retains. The  local exchange carrier or retailer is required to maintain billing and accounting  data and to provide the data to the department of revenue upon request.   b.   Obligation  of  principals.    Principals  are  responsible  for  remitting  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  on  all  amounts  paid  over  to  them  by  their  agents.    Long  distance  carriers,  inter-exchange  carriers  and  other  retailers who retain local exchange carriers or other agents in Illinois to bill and  collect  gross  charges  from  Chicago  customers  are  considered  to  be  retailers   Interstate telecommunications means all telecommunications that either originate  or  terminate  outside  Illinois.  This  term  includes  telecommunications  that  originate  or  terminate  outside  the  United  States  of  America.  Consumers  paying  a  foreign  tax  on  telecommunications  may  file  a  claim  for  credit  with  the  department  of  revenue  in  the  same manner as with taxes paid to other municipalities. (M.C.C., 3-73-020(G); M.C.C.,  3-73-030(B).)     17.  Responsibility for Accounting and Payment of Tax                       maintaining a place of business in this state.  Thus, they are required to register  with the department and file returns.   c.   Collection fee.  The 1.0% commission authorized by M.C.C., 3-73-   040(D) may be claimed only by the retailer filing a return with the department of  revenue, not by the billing agent, unless the agent also files a remittance return on  behalf of the retailer and remits the applicable tax.    18.  Bad Debts   Gross  charges  do  not  include  bad  debts.    However,  if  any  portion  of  a  debt  deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the telecommunications retailer must report and  pay the tax on that portion of the debt paid during the reporting period. (M.C.C., 3-73- 020(F)(7).)  For purposes of this provision, the term “bad debt” means any portion of a  debt that is related to a sale at retail, for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible  or  excludable,  that  has  become  worthless  or  uncollectible  as  determined  by  relevant  federal income tax standards. (M.C.C., 3-73-020(F).)                19.  Credits        A consumer who has paid both the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax  and a similar tax imposed by another municipality on the same transmission may file a  claim  for  credit  with  the  department  of  revenue.    The  claim  must  be  accompanied  by  documentation  showing  the  taxes  charged  to the  taxpayer  and  relating  the  taxes  to  the  specific call or transaction.  A credit may be available in Chicago to the extent of the tax  imposed  by  the  other  municipality,  if  actually  paid,  but  not  exceeding  the  Chicago  Simplified Telecommunications Tax paid. (M.C.C., 3-73-030(B).)     20.  Application of State Rulings and Regulations    Published   regulations   and   rulings   promulgated     Illinois  Telecommunications  Excise  Tax  Act  (35  ILCS  630/1  et  seq.)  apply  to  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  unless  (1)  a  state  ruling  or  regulation  relates  to  a  provision  of  the  Illinois  Telecommunications  Excise  Tax  Act  that  differs  in  substance  from  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  Ordinance  or  (2)  the  city’s  department  of  revenue  has  promulgated  a  ruling  or  regulation  relating  to  the  same  subject.     under   the   21.   Federal Regulatory Classifications   In the absence of a statute or judicial decision expressly and clearly providing       otherwise, the regulatory classification of a service shall not be controlling as to the  treatment of the service under the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax  Ordinance, and the terms of the Ordinance and these regulations shall control instead.     "

By early July 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,193 feet of new 8-inch water main in W. 22nd Place,  from 395 feet west of S. Wood Street to S. Wood Street, W. 23rd Street, from S. Wolcott Avenue to      S. Wood Street and S. Wood Street, from W. 23rd Street to 80 feet south of S. Blue Island Avenue. The  old water main dates back to 1873, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  25th Ward Office: 773-523-4100  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you,  our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our private contractor is currently installing a new tumbling basin at Wabash and 53rd Street and  a connection structure at State and 53rd Street. Following, our own crews will install a new sewer  in E. 53rd Street, from S. State Street to S. MLK Drive. The old sewer dates back to 1900 and  needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Dowell’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,     Thomas Powers  Commissioner     Cc: Alderman Pat Dowell         3rd Ward                                              1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1       Do you wonder what was happening in 1900?  That’s about the time the old sewer main was  installed beneath your street.  Among other things:           HAMBURGER        Hawaii became a U.S. territory.    The hamburger was created by Louis Lassing in Connecticut.    Actor Spencer Tracy was born.    The U.S. Navy’s first submarine made its debut.    The second modern Olympic Games opened in Paris, and lasted for 5 months.    L. Frank Baum wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.    The first electric bus became operational in New York City.    English handwriting experts established the art of calligraphy.                                       PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management’s private contractor is currently installing a  new tumbling basin at Wabash and 53rd Street and a connection structure at State and 53rd Street.  Following, in-house crews will install a new sewer in E. 53rd Street, from S. State Street to S.  MLK Drive.    Reason:  The old sewer main dates back to 1900 and needs replacement. The area bounded by  52nd Street on the north, 54th Street on the south, MLK Drive on the east, and State Street on the  west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  The contractor’s work is in progress, and we expect the job to be completed in late  October. Installation of the new sewer will take place from late October to mid-January. Final  restoration of the damaged streets/parkways will follow in May 2014. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:   We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours. When we are working in  the street, we may have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to  reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place. Outside of working  hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.           CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN PAT DOWELL   773-373-9273      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021             FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS           Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Dowell, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!      
11291`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dcd/general/housing/ARO_FAQs.pdf`Success`Success`3`3`Not a fillable PDF.`2015 ARO Frequently Asked Questions effective October 13, 2015   current as of August 7, 2015        Q. If a project includes a City lot – will the ARO apply to the entire project, even if the entire project is not  built on City land?   A. Yes – the Ordinance is specific that “whenever the city sells real property to any developer and such  property or any portion thereof is developed”… with a Residential Housing Project containing ten or more  units, the ARO applies. This is true even when the lot is utilized to satisfy minimum off-street parking,  minimum lot area, setback or other zoning or Municipal Code requirements or standards.      Q. Does the ARO apply to elective Planned Developments?   A: Yes, the ARO would apply, if the PD was located in a downtown zoning district, or the underlying zoning was  increased or changed to trigger the ARO (or City land or financial assistance was provided as part of the PD),  and the developer built a residential housing project on the site.    Q. Does the ARO apply to student housing?   A: The ARO exempts dormitories that are owned and operated by or on behalf of an educational institution.     Q. Does the ARO apply to hotel conversions?   A. If a developer wants to amend a PD to switch units from hotel keys to room keys, the change may reclassify  the building as residential, triggering the ARO if more than ten residential units are added.     Q. Does the ARO apply to hotel/condo units?  A. Hotel/Condo units are under exclusive ownership and therefore are considered dwelling units, triggering  the ARO.     Q. Will Special uses trigger the ARO?  A. Special uses are not technically considered a zoning change and thus will not trigger the ARO.    Q. Is the ARO triggered if a developer is adding units to an existing building?   A: Typically, the ARO only applies to the units that are being added to the existing building. In order not to be  subject to the ARO, existing units must be residential units. Note that if units are converted to condos or meet  the definition of “substantial rehab, they may trigger the ARO requirement, even if they were existing.     If a project receives financial assistance or City land, the existing units and any new units are subject,  collectively, to the ARO.         Page 1 of 3   2015 ARO Frequently Asked Questions effective October 13, 2015   current as of August 7, 2015        Q. What if a developer increases the floor area or unit count to a subarea within a Planned Development  but doesn’t increase the overall FAR or unit count: will the ARO be triggered?  A. The ARO will not apply unless the overall Floor Area is increased, and at least 10 additional residential  units  are developed (constructed; substantially rehabbed or converted from rental to condos) as part of the  amendment. If those triggers are met, the ARO will apply only to any additional units.    Q. Are there any exemptions to the ARO?   A. The ARO does not apply to any Residential Housing Project located on property that was rezoned and  thereby converted to a nonconforming use.  If the City Council subsequently approves a change in zoning  solely for the purpose of restoring the Residential Housing Project to a conforming use, that zoning change will  not trigger the ARO.      Q: Is “Class L” considered financial assistance?   A: Class L is a property tax exemption granted through the County, and is not considered City financial  assistance.    Q. Is the granting of City land considered financial assistance?   A: No.    Q. Does the ARO apply to projects that are receiving tax credits or other financial assistance from the City or  State?   A: Tax Credits constitute financial assistance, and, thus, the ARO applies. However, because the affordability  requirements for tax credits often exceed those of the ARO, the requirements associated with the tax credits  or other financial assistance will govern unless they expire or are withdrawn prior to the 30-year term  required for ARO projects. For PDs receiving Tax credits, Developers are required to include a statement that  requires that, should tax credits become inactive, the 30-year ARO term will apply for the remainder of the 30- year term.     Q. What if the market price and the affordable price are the same – or similar?   A. There is no provision in the ARO that exempts units that are already “affordable” by market standards.     Q. For Rental ARO projects, does it matter which unit in a building is affordable? As long as they continue to  provide affordable units in the required type (i.e. one-bedroom), can they switch from year to year?   A. The units designated as the ARO units must be similar in size and finishes, and must have the same number  of bedrooms as those initially designated as ARO units – but they do not need to be the same units.     Q. Is Parking required to be provided in the price/monthly rent of affordable units?   A. Parking is required to be provided in the price of affordable units if it is provided in the price/rent of the  market units.         Page 2 of 3   2015 ARO Frequently Asked Questions effective October 13, 2015   current as of August 7, 2015        Q. Can I pay my fee-in-lieu with a credit card or through wire transfer?  A. No, the only payment that is accepted is a check, made out to the City of Chicago and hand-delivered to the  ARO PM. It is advised that you make an appointment prior to delivering the payment, in order to ensure that  the ARO PM or their designee is available to receive the check.    Q. I am interested in purchasing a unit created prior to the 2015 ARO, but I earn 110% of the Area Median  Income. Can I purchase the unit?  A. In most cases, no: the terms that were in place at the time of the creation of the unit will, at minimum,  govern the initial sale of the unit, even if it is sold after the effective date of the 2015 ARO.

The use of  masculine gender includes the feminine gender, the singular includes the plural and plural  includes the singular.   ""Alternative Price System"" or"" APS"" means a system, certified by the Commissioner, other than  individual price marking, designed to inform consumers of the actual purchase price of an item and  which, when certified under these rules, exempts the retailer from the requirement of individual  price marking.   ""Bulk  Foods''  means  food  items  for  sale  in  aggregate  containers  from  which  the  consumer  withdraws a quantity for purchase (otherwise known as ""self-service"").  Examples of Bulk Foods  include dried beans or grains sold by weight from self-service containers in an Establishment or  pickles sold by count from  a barrel.  ··Bulk Food"" does not include fresh whole fruits or fresh  whole vegetables displayed for sale, nor does it include self-serve Salad Bar items.   ""Commissioner'' means the Commissioner of the Department of Business Affairs and  Consumer Protection or the Commissioner's designee.   ""Consumer Commodities"" mean consumer items that are ""used up"" and replaced by consumers  on a regular basis.  For example, a carton of milk or a package of trash bags is regularly used up,  and when a consumer runs out of such item, the consumer buys more.  On the other hand, a  plastic hair brush or cooking utensil is not a Consumer Commodity as it is not replaced on a  regular basis.   Consumer Commodities include, but are not limited to. the following items, however   packaged or contained:   (1) Food, beverages (including liquor), other items intended for consumption by  humans or animals and all substances or ingredients to be added to food;  (2) Paper, metal, and plastic products, including but not limited to napkins, facial'  tissues, toilet tissues, foil  wrap, plastic wrap, paper toweling, wrapping paper, cordage,  disposable diapers, and disposable plates~  (3)  Detergents, solvents, waxes, soaps and other cleansing agents, sponges and similar  cleaning accessories, and lubricants; and  (4)  Non-prescription drugs,  personal care  items,  including female  hygiene  products,  bandages, and toiletries;  (5) Household products, including light bulbs, batteries, camera supplies, candles, tape,  and adhesives.   4   Consumer Commodities shall not include:  (1) Unpackaged fresh produce;  (2)  Individual items under three cubic inches in size;  (3)  Individual items weighing less than three ounces; and  (4) Individual items priced under fifty cents.   "" Department"" means the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection,  which term includes the Commissioner and the Department's employees.   "" Department Store""  means a large retailer that sells an extensive and varied range of  Merchandise under the same roof, with various categories of Merchandise generally displayed in  discrete areas of the store.   ""Establishment"" means each separate retail location, whether or not affiliated with any  other retail location, where merchandise is offered for sale to the public, including  wholesalers, bulk sellers, and private membership sellers of merchandise direct to  consumers.   ""Overcharge""  means the price scanned or charged for an  item is more than the lowest  advertised, quoted, posted, or marked price.   "" Price"" means the amount stated in U.S. dollars and cents asked or charged for an item.   "" Printed Advertisement"" means printed material sent or made available to consumers outside  of the Establishment's location.  For example, weekly mailed flyers or hand-distributed sales  flyers.  It does not include in-store signage or in-store sales signs   "" Retailer"" means any establishment required to be licensed by the Department of Business  Affairs and Consumer Protection whkh offers goods for sale with the exception of any retail  food establishment whose sales of hot or cold food prepared to order and/or alcohol sold by the  drink make up at least 90% of its annual sales.   ""Sale Items""  means goods offered by the seller for less than the regular price.   ""Sales Dates"" means the beginning and ending dates of any sales advertisement.   "" Specialty Establishment""  means an Establishment designated by the Commissioner at which  annual in-person store sales of Consumer Commodities are 10% or less of the Establishment's  total annual sales.  An Establishment must apply to the Commissioner by letter requesting that it  be designated a Specialty Establishment under these rules and regulations and in that request  must submit documentation sufficient to establish that the Establishment's annual sales of  Consumer Commodities are 1 0% or less of its annual sales.  Designation as a Specialty  Establislzment exempts a Retail Establishment from Rule 5 only.   ""Store"" means ""Establishment"" as defined above.   5   ""Unit Price"" means the price of individual Consumer Commodities, calculated by dividing the  total selling price by the total count, measure or weight of the individual item.   ""Universal Product Code"" or ""UPC""  means a unique symbol that consists of a machine  readable code (vertical bars of varying thickness) and human-readable numbers.  UPC's are  incorporated into package graphics or are applied with tags or labels.   ""Variety Combination Packaging"" means two (2) or more individual packages or units of  Consumer Commodities packaged together or unpackaged for retail sale for one price.  Examples  of Variety Combination Packaging include but are not limited to gift baskets; sponge & cleaner  combination packaging; non-prescription drugs packaged together that contain both tablet and  liquid units; free samples or travel-size packages included with, or attached to, full-size products  where the full-sized product is unit priced; a number of mix or match items combi ned by  consumer in store, etc.  The foregoing are examples stated to illustrate the concept, and are not  exclusive of other combinations, groupings, or special packaging that may be offered from time  to time to consumers.   ""Small Stores"" means establishments with two (2) registers or less.   ""Large Stores""  means establishments with three (3) or more registers.   SECTION I.   APS  - CERTIFICATION   RULEl   Application for Certification.   a.  Any individual Establishment located in the City of Chicago may apply for  certification of an APS by letter addressed to the Commissioner of Business  Affairs and Consumer Protection or at the time of obtaining or renewing its  business license.   b.  Any Establishment that is APS-certified under these rules and regulations   must apply for certification of any new or additional location operated by the  Establishment.   6   b.  All unit pricing must be in  United States dollars and cents.  Where the Unit   Price is less than $1.00 per unit priced, the Unit Price shall be shown in at  least cents to the tenth of a cent (for example, show 28.7 cents per ounce, or  0.287 dollars per ounce).   c.  Unit pricing is not required if an Establishment only carries one brand in only   one size.   d.  Variety Combination Packaging and Specialty Establishments shall be exempt   from Unit Price requirements.   e.  Undiluted, concentrated products and un-reconstituted powdered drink mixes   shall be unit priced uniformly with other similar undiluted, concentrated  products and un-reconstituted powdered drink mixes.  Thus, all powdered ice  tea mix packages would be unit priced using the same unit of measure as other  powdered ice tea mix packages, but not necessarily using the same unit as  ready-to-drink ice tea sold in a bottle.  The foregoing is only an example to  illustrate the concept behind the rule, which is that items that compete with  each other must be unit priced uniformly.   RULE 6   Inspection.   Upon receipt of an application, the Commissioner shall cause an   inspection of each APS location for which certification is sought. Inspection will  take place within 90 days after receiving the application letter and payment, or  within 120 days if certification for more than one Establishment is sought.   RULE7   Failure of Inspection.   a.  If the Establishment fails to pass its APS inspection. the Establishment shall   be re-inspected upon payment of are-inspection fee as set forth  in Rule 9.   b.  Re-inspections may require further documentation submitted for inspection   andre-inspection may be limited to such documentation, depending upon each  Establishment's individual situation.   RULES   Renewal of Certification.   Each APS certification must be renewed every four (4) years.  Prior to the  expiration of the current APS certificate, the Department will send a renewal  application.  This application for each business location must be completed and  returned to the Department within the time period specified by the Department.  Nothing in these Rules and Regulations, however, shall relieve an Establishment  from the responsibility of maintaining and renewing its APS Certification.   8   RULE9   APS Certification Application Inspection Fees.   The inspection fee authorized by the City Council shall be remitted to the  Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection within 30 days of  notification of the amount of fees due.  Pursuant to§ 4-276510(b), for Large  Stores, a fee of $500.00 is required for certification of the first store location and  $100.00 for each additional location; for Small Stores, a fee of$250.00 is required  for the first store location and $50.00 for each additional location.  A fee of  $100.00 (Large Stores) and $50.00 (Small Stores) is required for every re(cid:173) inspection necessary due to the failure or late re-scheduling of an applicant's  initial APS certification inspection under these Rules and Regulations.  Not  receiving a renewal application shall not be a defense to a charge of failing to  renew.   SECTION II.   APS  - PRICING   RULE 10   Effect of APS Certification and APS Application.   An Establishment will be exempt from individually price marking each item  offered for purchase only if the Establishment ( 1) has an APS letter of  certification or (2) has a valid, paid application on file and otherwise complies  with Rule 2.   RULE 11   Double Check Procedures.   All  APS  Establishments must designate  an employee at each Establishment's  location, who can verify (a) the on-site accuracy of the information entered into an  automated APS pricing system; (b) the proper placement of shelf labels; and (c)  the proper placement of all other Establishment signage.   RULE 12   Point-Of-Sale Device Requirements.   All APS must provide visible indication, which can be observed from a  ""reasonable"" customer position, of an  item's Price and description (including, if  applicable, the item's weight and measure) as the item is scanned.   RULE 13   Receipt Requirements.   a.  Except as otherwise provided in these rules, every purchase must be   documented by a receipt.  A copy of the receipt must be offered to the  customer.   9   c.  Department Stores need only affix or place a label on a shelf if the items  displayed for sale on the shelf are not already individually price-marked.  Merchandise offered for sale at a counter that is manned with a sales associate  available for immediate assistance is exempt from this rule.   RULE16   Non-Shelved, End Cap, or Other Display Item Signage.   a.  A sign no smaller than 511  x 711  is required for item displays not located on   shelves.  When any question arises as to whether an item is displayed upon a  shelf or not, this non-shelved item rule shall be applied.   b.  The same information as required for Shelf Labels must be included on such   signs.  In addition, the name of the item and its selling price must be no  smaller than  1 II  high bold type.

St. Louis Avenue, from W. 58th Street to W. 59th Street, and in W. 58th Place, from S. Central Park  Avenue to S. St. Louis Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old pipe  dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be completed by  late December. Restoration will follow in late May 2014. Dates may change depending on weather and  other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on St. Louis and 58th Place outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to  reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a  lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are agreeable to  parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water main,  please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and  metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  These screens should be  removed prior to flushing.  This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing  sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line  as a result of the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.      CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN EDWARD M.

The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to reduce  the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only strategy— homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on practical steps (public  and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

St. Louis Avenue (58th St.-59th St.), y en W. 58th Place (Central Park-St. Louis).    Razón:   La cañería principal antigua consiste de tubería de 6 pulgadas y queremos ampliar la  capacidad. Además la tubería antigua se remonta al año 1909 y necesita ser reemplazada.     Horario:   En breve comenzaremos a instalar la nueva cañería de agua y esperamos que el  trabajo sea terminado a fines de diciembre. Restauración seguirá a finales de mayo 2014. Fechas  pueden cambiar dependiendo del tiempo y otros factores. Le notificaremos si hay algún cambio  considerable.     Trafico:   Permitiremos el movimiento de tráfico en St. Louis y en  58th Place fuera de horas de  trabajo. Cuando estamos trabajando en la calle tenemos que cerrar al tráfico por razones de  seguridad. Usted siempre tendrá acceso a su propiedad o negocio incluso si esto significa poner  una placa de metal en lugar. Fuera de horas de trabajo un carril quedara abierto solo para el  tráfico local.    Estacionamiento:   Según lo necesario fijaremos anuncios de “Prohibido Estacionarse” durante  las horas de trabajo. Estamos de acuerdo con el estacionamiento fuera de esas horas, pero  tendremos que insistir que los coches se muevan para el principio del próximo día de trabajo.  Preservaremos tanto estacionamiento como sea posible.     Después de que su antigua cañería de agua ha sido reemplazada y se han conectada a su nueva  cañería de agua, abrir todos los grifos de agua y manguera y enjuague el agua durante 3 a 5 minutos.   Sedimentos y metales se pueden acumular en la pantalla de aireador ubicada en la punta de su grifería.  Estas pantallas se deben retirar antes de que enjuague el agua.  Este lavado ayudará a mantener la calidad  óptima de agua mediante la eliminación de sedimentos, herrumbre o cualquier partículas de plomo que  pueden han soltado de la línea de servicio de agua de la propiedad como resultado de la reemplazando de  la cañería de agua.   Si usted tiene alguna pregunta o inquietud sobre la calidad del agua, por favor  llámenos al 312-744-8190.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to monitor water  usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the water actually used,  encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and number of  plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that with minimal effort,  participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter had not   been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   Homeowner Incentives   rain barrel,        outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org, call 311, or  call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is limited based on funding  availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with the  automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water Management  vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the home.  Bills will be  issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited time offer  of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).        1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water Management  will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of our  water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons per  month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 30% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 10 gallons per  wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically use half  the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20-50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands of gallons  of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by preventing needless  watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million Olympic- sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe water shortages by  2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake Michigan.

MeterSave es un programa para animar a dueños de casa en Chicago a instalar un contador,  voluntariamente, para medir el uso del agua.  Un contador permite a un dueño, sea de una casa singular o  de un edificio de dos pisos, a pagar solamente por el agua usado en realidad, animando esfuerzos para  conservar agua y dinero y protegiendo a la vez uno de nuestros más preciosos recursos naturales.      Las facturas para casas sin contador están basadas en factores como el tamaño del edificio, el tamaño de  la parcela de terreno y el sistema de cañerías y el número de aparatos fijos. Casas con contador pagarán  según el uso preciso del agua.  Esto significa que con esfuerzo mínimo, dueños participantes podrían  ahorrar gastos para el agua.       Incentivos para propietarios   Propietarios sin contadores de agua que participen en MeterSave calificarán para lo siguiente:     Una garantía de 7 años que la factura para el agua no sobrepasará lo que hubiera sido sin contador.   La factura no excederá del precio asignado para ese año.     La elección de uno de los siguientes (mientras que las fuentes duren):     barril para guardar la lluvia    equipo para la conservación de agua fuera de la casa     equipo para la conservación de agua dentro de la casa      ¡La elección de dos de los incentivos mencionados si participan todos los dueños de una  cuadra!     Preguntas frecuentes:   ¿Cómo y cuándo inscribirme en el programa?  Propietarios interesados de casas singulares o de residencias de dos pisos sin contadores de agua pueden  visitar la página de internet www.metersave.org, llamar a 311, o llamar a 312-744-4H2O. Tenga por favor  su número de cuenta de 12 dígitos listo.  El espacio es limitado basado en disponibilidad de la  financiación y el número de voluntarios.    ¿Cuánto costará participar?  El Departamento de Administración de Agua para la Ciudad de Chicago instalará GRATIS un contador  de agua en su casa completo con la tecnología de lectura automática del contador (automatic meter  reading, o AMR).     La tecnología AMR permite que la lectura del contador se transmite a través de una tecnología de radio  inalámbrico a los vehículos de la Administración de Agua mientras pasan por las casas, y así se evita la  necesidad de leer el contador dentro de la casa. Las facturas se le pasarán cada dos meses y reflejarán sólo  la cantidad real de agua usada.      ¿Tengo que tener mi cuenta para agua al corriente?  Sí. Propietarios tienen que tener su cuenta o su plan de pagos al corriente para poder participar en esta   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1       oferta por tiempo limitado de una garantía de 7 años.      Para información sobre un plan de pagos, llame al 312-744-4H20 (4426).     ¿Cuándo puedo conseguir un contador?  La previsión en línea de la instalación del contador está disponible en www.metersave.org.  Si no,  Administración de Agua le llamará para hacer una cita para la instalación del contador.        Cambios pequeños adoptados por la gente en Chicago pueden tener un impacto tremendo en  mantener el suministro sostenible de agua, como:     Cerrar el agua mientras lavando los dientes o afeitándose. Esto puede ahorrar más que 500   galones cada mes por cada persona.     Instalar inodoros de alta eficacia. Inodoros consumen 26% del agua usada en casa. Un inodoro que   pierde agua desperdicia 200 galones de agua cada día.     Instalar lavadoras de alta eficacia. Esto puede ahorrar energía y el consumo de agua.    Llenar el lavatorio con agua para lavar platos en vez de lavarlos bajo agua abierta. Esto ahorra 10   galones cada vez.     Si tiene un lavaplatos, que se llene antes de prenderlo. Los lavaplatos típicamente usan la mitad de   la energía, un sexto del agua, y menos jabón comparado con lavando los platos en el lavatorio.     Trabajar con plantas indígenas de Chicago en su jardín. Esto puede reducir la cantidad de agua   usada afuera entre 20% y 50%.     Usar barriles para guardar la lluvia, para regar el césped y el jardín.    Usar un temporizador o un sensor de lluvia para controlar el riego del césped. Sistemas para regar   gastan miles de galones de agua cada ciclo. Instalar un temporizador o un sensor evitará el riego  innecesario y ahorrará dinero y agua.       AGUA   Nuestro Recurso Más Precioso    El Lago Michigan ha perdido casi 32 trillones de galones de agua – el equivalente de más que 45 millones   de piscinas olímpicas – en la última década. Nuestra región podría enfrentarse a una falta de agua en el   año 2050 si no logramos tomar acción decisiva.      Más que la mitad del consumo de agua en Chicago ocurre en las casas.   Más que 5.4 millones de personas, igual a 44% de la población del estado de Illinois, cuentan con el   Departamento de Administración de Agua en Chicago para el suministro fiable de agua potable del Lago   Michigan.         ¡Inscríbase hoy por un contador para ahorrar agua y dinero!

The project is being constructed to reduce flooding in the Albany Park Neighborhood.  Major  storm events in 2008 and 2013 highlighted the significant flood risk posed by the Chicago River  in this area.  Following the April 2013 flood, Mayor Emanuel along with state, Federal and local  agencies developed a plan to divert excess flood water from the Chicago River to the North  Shore Channel.       What is the project about?      During flood events, excess river water will be diverted into an 18-foot diameter tunnel via an  inlet structure located near Springfield Avenue along the south bank of the river within a small  section of undeveloped Chicago Park District land.  The tunnel will run 150 feet below Foster  Avenue eastward approximately 5,800 feet to an outlet structure in River Park along the east  bank of the North Shore Channel.  Two large shafts will be excavated through soil and rock to  the base of the tunnel.  The tunnel will be excavated using a Tunnel Boring Machine.  The rock  excavated during the tunneling will be removed from the outlet shaft at River Park and  removed from the site.  Once the tunnel construction is completed, the two park areas will be  restored.  The park on Foster Avenue at Springfield will become a new park amenity which was  previously used only for Park District stockpiles and maintenance.  The park area at River Park  will include a new well drained baseball field and regulation soccer field.        Who is doing the work?   The project is being undertaken by the City of Chicago.  The Chicago Department of  Transportation (CDOT) is the lead City agency in charge of the project.  The project is funded  using a combination of funds from the City of Chicago, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation  District of Greater Chicago (MWRDGC), Illinois Department of Natural Resources and U.S.  Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The two construction work areas are on  property owned by the Chicago Park District.  Kenny Construction is the construction contractor  and WSP – Parsons Brinkerhoff is CDOT’s construction management consultant.        When will the construction be happening?   Work will begin in May 2016 and continue for two years.  During the spring and summer of  2016, work will include setting up the construction work areas and excavating the inlet and  outlet shafts.  The tunneling work will start in late fall 2016 and continue through late 2017.   The inlet and outlet structures will be constructed in 2017 with final construction and site  restoration finishing in spring 2018.        Where will the work be done?   There will be two construction sites located on Chicago Park District property.  The main  construction site is located at the north end of River Park, immediately south of Foster Avenue  on the east bank of the channel.  This site includes the outlet shaft and structure and will be the  location of most of the tunnel excavation activities.  The inlet structure site is located north of  Foster Avenue near the Springfield Avenue intersection.      The tunnel will be located under Foster Avenue.  There will be no construction or lane closures  on Foster Avenue itself.  Trucks will use Foster Avenue to remove tunnel rock and bring in  materials for the construction.  Worker parking will be within the contractor’s work area and  not on residential streets.  The existing bike path in River Park will be temporarily closed during  construction and a new path and pedestrian crossing signal will be added temporarily across  Foster Avenue.        How will the shafts and tunnel be built?   The shafts will be excavated vertically through approximately 70 feet of soil and 75 to 100 feet  of rock.  Sheet piling or other earth retention systems will be used to support the surrounding  soils throughout construction.  The rock will be excavated using controlled blasting overseen by  an Illinois licensed blaster and an independent blasting consultant.  The contract includes  stringent specifications regarding safety, vibration and noise limits, vibration and settlement  monitoring as well as a public awareness program to inform the community of blasting  activities.     Most of the tunnel will be excavated using a tunnel boring machine, or TBM.  The TBM is a very  large mechanical device which bores through the rock and removes the chipped rock through a  conveyance system back through the tunnel and up the shaft at River Park.  The excavated  material is then loaded on trucks and removed.  Over 100 truck trips will be required daily   during full tunnel mining operations.    Once the tunnel is excavated, the exposed rock will be stabilized using steel rock bolts, grouted  as needed to reduce groundwater seepage into the tunnel and lined with concrete for long  term stability.           Has this type of work been done before in Chicago?   More Detailed Questions……   The City of Chicago and MWRDGC have constructed numerous tunnels over many decades for  stormwater and potable water conveyance.  MWRDGC has constructed over 109 miles of rock  tunnels as part of the Deep Tunnel project.  The Albany Park tunnel contractor has constructed  many tunnels nationally and in Chicago including most recently the three mile long MWRDGC  39th Street tunnel.       What about blasting noise and vibration? Will the work damage my house?   Public safety is paramount.  Although the blasting operations will cause vibrations, it is highly  unlikely that it will cause damage to adjacent property. However, as a precaution, the  contractor will conduct a pre-construction settlement survey of private properties within 500  feet of the blasting locations.  Throughout the project, the settlement, vibration, and noise  levels will be continuously monitored. If the levels exceed specified stringent thresholds, the  construction team will take steps to mitigate the noise and vibrations. .   How will residents be notified about blasting and other construction activities?   A public information meeting will be scheduled through the Alderman’s office for your ward.   Additionally, project information and schedule will be posted on the ward website in advance  of major construction operations.  During blasting, a horn alert warning system will be  implemented in conjunction with warning signage to alert the nearby public of an impending  blast.  Blasting will be scheduled once per day, only during weekday, daytime hours,  approximately every other day.   How will dust be controlled?   Housekeeping of the project site and impacted roadway will be monitored and addressed to  minimize the dust from trucking and construction operations.   How much additional truck traffic will there be?   There will be a higher than normal volume of truck traffic on Foster during daytime hours due  to the removal and delivery of materials, but there are no plans to restrict or close lanes on  Foster Avenue or any of the cross streets. The project team is currently coordinating with Office  of Emergency Management and Communication (OEMC) to address the possibility of the higher  volumes increasing travel times.     Which wards are involved?   The project involves three aldermanic wards – the 33rd (Deborah Mell), the 39th (Margaret  Laurino) and the 40th ward (Patrick O’Connor).     How will the community be protected from flooding until the tunnel is finished?   Stating in May 2016, City forces will be constructing a temporary flood barrier wall along Foster  Avenue and the south side of the Chicago River to reduce flooding risk while the tunnel is being  constructed.  This wall will consist of concrete jersey barriers and sand bags.  This work will be  completed in June 2016.  City agencies will continually monitor the river levels and take   necessary steps to minimize flooding risk during construction.  The general alignment is shown  below.   How will I cross Foster Avenue at the park during construction?    Foster Avenue and all intersection crosswalks are scheduled to be open throughout  construction, with the exception of Foster and Avers.  At the intersection of Foster and Avers,  CDOT will be installing a traffic signal, ADA ramps, and roadway resurfacing, crosswalk detours  will be provided while this intersection is being improved.    Additionally a crosswalk and signal will be installed at the intersection of Virginia across Foster  for bicyclist and pedestrians to cross Foster.   What will the sites look like once construction is complete?   Once the tunnel construction is completed, the two park areas will be completely restored.   Eugene Park on Foster Avenue at Springfield will become a new park amenity which was  previously used only for Park District stockpiles and maintenance, new entrances and pathways  will offer a renewed functionality of the park space for the public.   The park area at River Park  will include a new well drained baseball field with new fencing and backstop, a regulation  soccer field, and new bicycle and pedestrian pathways.   What is the cost of this project?   $70 Million   How can I get more information?   A public information meeting will be scheduled for this summer before any blasting occurs  through the Alderman’s office for your ward.  Regular project information and schedule  updates will also be provided through your ward office.

To  your  knowledge,  the  only  company  that  has  any  relationship with the  City is  [Company A  ],  which leases  space  at  [the  site ].  You stated that  you  had  no  role  in  leasing  this  space  to  the  company  and  make  no  decisions  concerning  [the  company   ] in your City employment.   The  Ordinance  provision  most  relevant  to  your  question  is  Sec.  2-156-040,  which  states,  in  relevant part:   (b)  No  person shall  give  or offer to  give to  any  official,  employee  or  City  contractor,  or  to  the  spouse  or  minor  child  of either  of  them,  and none  of them shall  accept,  anything of value,  including,  but not  limited to,  a  gift,  favor  or promise  of future  employment,  based  upon  any  mutual  understanding,  either  explicit  or  implicit,  that  the  votes,  official  actions,  decisions  or  judgments  of  any  official,  employee  or  City  contractor,  concerning  the  business  of  the  City  would  be  influenced thereby.  It shall  be  presumed  that  a  nonmonetary  gift  having  a  value  of  less  than  $50.00  does  not  involve such an understanding.   (c)  No  person  who  has  an  economic  interest  in  a  specific  City  business,  service  or  regulatory  transaction  shall  give,  directly  or  indirectly,  to  any  City  official  or  employee  whose  decision  or  action may substantially affect such transaction, or to the spouse or  minor  child  of such  official  or employee,  and  none  of them  shall  accept,  any  gift of (i)  cash or its  equivalent regardless  of value,  or  (ii)  an  item  or  service  other  than  an  occasional  one  of nominal  value (less than $50.00) provided, however, nothing herein shall be  construed  to  prohibit  such  person  from  accepting  gifts  from  relatives.   While  Sec.  2-156-040(b)  prohibits  a  City  employee  from  accepting  anything  of value  (which  would  include  airline  tickets)  based  upon  any  mutual  understanding  that  his  official  actions,  decisions  or  judgments  concerning  the  business  of  the  City  would  be  influenced  by  such  acceptance, the random nature of your selection as a winner from among the 200 (by your count)  persons  in  attendance  at  the  party  tends  to  rule  out  any  intent  to  specifically  influence  your  actions  as  a  City  employee.  (See  Case No. 00022.Q,  where  the  Board  addressed  the  issue  of a  City employee whose name was  chosen  in a random drawing for  free  registration to  an annual   Case No. 01050.Q  December 19, 200 1  Page 3   conference  of a  professional  organization,  valued  at  $800.00.  The  Board  determined  that  the  Ordinance  did  not  prohibit  the  employee  from  accepting  the  free  registration,  as  the  random  nature  of the  drawing  ruled  out  any  intent  to  influence  any  of the  employee's  governmental  actions  in  violation  of Sec.  2-156-040.  See  also  Case  No.  90022.A,  where  staff advised  an  employee  who  had  won  an  $800.00  gift  certificate  in  a  drawing  that  the  random  nature  of the  drawing tended to rule out intent to specifically influence her actions as a City employee.)   Sec.  2-156-040(c) prohibits an employee from accepting any ""gift"" from  any person who  has  an  economic  interest  in  a  specific  City  business,  service  or  regulatory  transaction,  when  the  employee's decision  or action may  substantially affect  such a transaction.  You  have  said that  you make no  decisions and take no  actions in your City position that would affect any economic  interest that any of the prize donors  have in any City business,  service or regulatory transaction.  Therefore, under this section the acceptance of the tickets is not prohibited.   Therefore, based on previous Board opinions and the facts  you have presented, it is  Board staffs  opinion  that  the  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  you  from  accepting  the  tickets  you  won  in  the  drawing.   Staffs opinion is  not necessarily dispositive  of all  issues  relevant to  this  situation,  but is  based  solely on the  application of the City's Governmental Ethics  Ordinance to  the  facts  stated in this  opinion.  If the  facts  stated  are  incorrect  or  incomplete,  please  notify  us  immediately,  as  any  change may alter our opinion.  Other laws or rules  also may apply to this situation.  Be  advised  that City departments have the authority to  adopt and enforce rules  of conduct that may be  more  restrictive than the limitations imposed by the Ethics Ordinance.   We  appreciate your inquiry  and  your  concern to  abide  by the  standards  embodied in the  Ethics  Ordinance.  We enclose a copy of the Ordinance for your convenience.  If you have any further  questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.   Very truly yours,   ]   [signature  John H.  Mathews  Legal Counsel   Approved by:   ]   [signature  Dorothy J.

By late February 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and NPL Construction Co. crews  will begin the work to install 1,729 feet of new 8-inch and 2,752 feet of new 12-inch water main in  N. Damen Avenue, from W. Argyle Street to W. Montrose Avenue and W. Wilson Avenue, from N.  Damen Avenue to N. Seeley Avenue.  The old water main dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  47th Ward Office: 773-868-4747  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,536 feet of 8-inch  water main in E. 81st Street, from S. Dorchester Avenue to S. Stony Island Avenue and S.  Blackstone Avenue, from E. 79th Street to E. 81st Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by early June 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on 81st Street and Blackstone Avenue outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in early June 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.                Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

On October 31, 2013, Officer Smith filed with the Police Board a request for Police   Board review of this suspension. On November 6, 2013, Officer Smith filed with the Police   Board a memorandum delineating specific reasons for which the review was requested.    The Executive Director of the Police Board assigned this matter to Hearing Officer   Jacqueline A. Walker.  Hearing Officer Walker reviewed the investigation file and submitted a   written report to the Police Board.     The members of the Police Board reviewed the Summary Report of the investigation file,   the Command Channel Review reports, Officer Smith’s memorandum, and Hearing Officer   Walker’s report.  Hearing Officer Walker made an oral report to and conferred with the Police   Board before it rendered its findings and decision.       POLICE BOARD FINDINGS   The Police Board of the City of Chicago, as a result of its consideration of this matter,   finds and determines that:   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2317  Police Officer Chad Smith  Findings and Decision                 1.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Chad Smith, Star No. 6021,   violated Rule 1 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On July 16, 2011, at approximately 1525 hours, at 2150 North California Avenue, Chicago,  Officer Smith failed to secure and control an arrestee, resulting in the arrestee escaping.     The Department’s investigation indicated on the date as charged, Officer Smith and   Police Officer Kenneth Trempe investigated a report of juveniles shoplifting at K-Mart, located   at 1360 North Ashland Avenue.  As a result, two juveniles were placed in custody and both were   taken to the 14th District for processing.  Both juveniles were handcuffed together.        The investigation further revealed that when Officers Smith and Trempe arrived at the   14th District parking lot, and while the Officers were escorting the two juveniles, one of the   juveniles freed his hand from the handcuffs and fled on foot, and successfully made his escape.    The escapee was not readily found in the area, even though a search for him was conducted.                On August 4, 2011, the juvenile was subsequently apprehended and charged with escape.      2.   The Police Board has considered the facts and circumstances of Officer Smith’s   conduct, and his complimentary and disciplinary histories.  This case involves the escape of a   juvenile arrested for a non-violent offense (shoplifting).  Officer Smith and his partner   immediately attempted to apprehend the escapee, and promptly made notifications of the escape.   The escapee was subsequently located, arrested, and charged with escape about three weeks   later.  The Board finds that the ten-day suspension ordered in this case is unwarranted, and that   the one-day suspension recommended by the investigator, all members of Command Channel      2   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2317  Police Officer Chad Smith  Findings and Decision    Review, and the Chief of the Bureau of Internal Affairs is a justified penalty on the facts of this               particular case.          POLICE BOARD DECISION      The Police Board of the City of Chicago hereby adopts the findings set forth herein by   the following vote:      By a vote of 9 in favor (Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William  F. Conlon, Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D.  Sweeney) to 0 opposed, the Board sustains the allegation that Police Officer Chad Smith  violated Rule 5.     As a result of the foregoing, the Board, by a vote of 9 in favor (Carney, Foreman, Ballate,   Conlon, Eaddy, Fry, McKeever, Rodriguez, and Sweeney) to 0 opposed, hereby determines that   cause exists for suspending Police Officer Chad Smith from his position as a police officer with   the Department of Police, and from the services of the City of Chicago, for a period of one (1)   day.   NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the suspension of Police   Officer Chad Smith, Star No. 6021, for a period of ten (10) days is reduced to a period of one   (1) day.    This disciplinary action is adopted and entered by a majority of the members of the   Police Board: Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William F. Conlon,   Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D. Sweeney.

By late June 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,283 feet of new 8-inch and 2,977 feet of new 12- inch water main in S. Wood Street, from S. Archer Avenue to W. 37th St. and W. 33rd Street, from S.  Wood Street to S. Ashland Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1879, and needs to be  replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  12th Ward Office: 773-523-8250  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

Case No.:  04-E-1 03   Date of Ruling: April  15, 2009   I.   INTRODUCTION   FINAL RULING   Complainant Ellyn VanDyck filed a Complaint on June 10, 2004, alleging that she suffered  discrimination in violation of the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance based on perceived disability  when she was fired from her job as a fill-in bartender at Respondent, Old Time Tap, located at 13501  S.  Brandon A venue in Chicago.  Old Time Tap maintains that after Ms. VanDyck missed work due  to a medical condition unrelated to her job, she failed to retum to work; then the bartender for whom  she was filling in returned to work, so Ms.  VanDyck was no longer needed.  Old Time Tap denies  that it had knowledge of her medical condition or that her medical condition had anything to do with  its decision to replace her.   The  Commission  on  Human  Relations  found  substantial  evidence  of a  violation  of the  Chicago Human Rights Ordinance and advanced the case to the administrative hearing process.  Ms.  Van  Dyck  represented  herself  pro  se  at  the  administrative  hearing,  and  Old  Time  Tap  was  represented  by counsel.  The  hearing  was  conducted on  September  10,  2008,  and  post -hearing  briefing was completed on December 22, 2008.   II.   FACTUAL FINDINGS   A.   1.   The Facts   Complainant,  Ellyn  Van  Dyck,  was hired by Old Time Tap  as  a  fill-in  bartender   sometime in  2003.  (Tr.  13.)   2.   3.   Old Time Tap is  owned and operated by Don and Christine Jones.  (Tr. 93, 127 .)   The job opening that Van Dyck filled  arose when bartender Geri Polozet chose to   reduce her shifts to one day a week because of her pregnancy.  (Tr. 94-96.)   4.   VanDyck's  original  shifts  were  Wednesday  and  Sunday  nights,  but  as  business  slowed, she was  cut back to just Sundays.  (Tr.  12.)  Respondent's Exhibit (""RX"")  I,  which was  received into evidence. reflects some if not all of the hours VanDyck worked at Old Time Tap.   5.   The last day VanDyck worked at Old Time Tap was Sunday, December 7, 2003.  (Tr.  16.)  A  few  days  later,  on  December  10,  for  reasons  that had  nothing to  do  with  her  work,  she  became dizzy, fell, hit her head, and had to go to the hospital.  (Tr.  16, 17.)   6.   The  parties  agree  that  Old  Time  Tap  bears  no  responsibility  for  her  injury  or   hospitalization.  (Tr. 75.)   7.   She remained in the hospital for four days and remembers little about that experience.  (Tr.  17.)  In fact, VanDyck had been suffering dizzy spells since 2002, a condition for which she had  been taking medication.  (Tr.  19-20.)   8.   Although she never shared her medical information with Old Time Tap, she had also   suffered a mild stroke in 2002.  (Tr.  19-20, 41.)   9.   Don Jones had no knowledge ofVan Dyck' s medical conditions, and he never noticed   any medical condition affecting Van Dyck's work in any way.  (Tr. 41, 109-110.)   10.   On one occasion, Don Jones saw VanDyck taking some pills, and he asked her about   them, but only to ensure that she was not using illegal drugs.  (Tr.  115.)   11.   VanDyck was scheduled to work the evening of December 14, 2003.  She had been  released from the hospital earlier that day and initially thought she was well enough to go to work.  But as the day went on she started feeling ill, and so she called to say she couldn't come in because,  she said, she had had a dizzy spell, fell,  and hit her head.  (Tr.  23, 25, 64.)  Although she believes  she  spoke  directly  with  Don Jones,  he  denies  speaking  with  her;  he  believes  he  learned  of her  absence from the bartender who was on duty earlier that day.  (Tr.  23, 50, 103-104.)   12.   In any event, VanDyck did not work the night of December 14, and someone else   covered her shift.  (Tr. 25,  103-104.)   13.   VanDyck recalls phoning or visiting the Old Time Tap on several other occasions  after December 14.  She left messages for Don Jones but got no response.  (Tr. 25-26, 43, 44.)  She  admits, however, that her recollection of how many times she went to the Tap to speak with Don  Jones is  not good.  (Tr. 43-44.)  She believes that on December 16, she spoke with  Don Jones and  he told her he did not  want her to  return because she  was  ""a risk and a liability.""  (Tr.  27.)  She  recalls calling him again and leaving messages,  but she never received a return call.  (Tr.  26-27.)  Don Jones denies this, however, and further denies having had any phone conversations with Van  Dyck after her last day of work, December 7, 2003.  (Tr.  104-105,  118-119.)   14.   According to Don Jones, because he never heard from VanDyck after December 14,  he  thought she had  simply failed  to  show  up  on  Sunday,  December 21,  2003,  and  he  asked  the  Tuesday night bartender, Eddie Brummel, to fill  in for her.  (Tr.  104-105.)   15.   The only telephone at the Old Time Tap is  a pay phone, which both customers and  management use.  (Tr. 60.)  When VanDyck was on duty, she answered the phone nine times out   2    of ten, and it is  likely that other bartenders answered the phone when they were on duty.  (Tr. 60.)  There is  no answering machine on this phone.  (Tr.  117.)   16.   By chance, VanDyck and Don Jones ran into each other at a local hardware store in  January 2004.  (Tr. 27,  107,  113.)  When VanDyck asked Jones, ""What's up  with work?"" he told  her they had replaced her.  (Tr.  27, 108.)   17.   Eddie Brummel, who had more seniority than VanDyck, took the Sunday evening   shift during the month ofJanuary.  (Tr.  119-120.)   18.   The  bartender  whom  Van  Dyck  had  replaced,  Geri  Polozet,  returned  from  her   maternity leave on Wednesday, February 4, 2004.  (Tr.  109.)   19.   VanDyck was paid $50 per night, and as noted above, at the time of her injury, she   was working only one night per week.  (Tr.  20, 34.)   20.   VanDyck was out of work for approximately ten months until November  l, 2004,   when she took a job as a cashier in Hammond, Indiana.  (Tr.  68.)   21.   She estimates her lost income for this ten-month period amounts to $2,000 in lost  wages, plus tips, which she estimates would have totaled $2,100.  (Tr. 68-76.)  She admits, however,  that she never kept track of tips and the amount may have been significantly lower.  (Tr. 71-72.)   22.   Because ofPolozet's return to work, VanDyck's job as a fill-in bartender would have   ended February  l, 2004, in any event.   23.   Although VanDyck offered medical records showing substantial medical bills related  to her December 10, 2003, fall, e.g. Complainant's Exhibits A and B, there was no contention that  Old Time Tap was responsible for that injury.  Only the last page of Exhibit A was  received into  evidence.  (Tr. 92.)   B.   Credibility   24.   The hearing officer found Ms. VanDyck very credible and very precise.  In addition  to her own testimony, VanDyck called her boyfriend, Wayde Bleege, to testify.  Mr. Bleege was also  found  very credible; however, he had little if anything to say that was relevant to Ms.  VanDyck's  claim.   25.   Respondent's witnesses were Don and Christine Jones, the owners of Old Time Tap.   They were also found credible.   26.   The hearing officer noted that during the course of the hearing, each of the witnesses   for both sides appeared to make every effort to testify honestly.   3   III.   CONCLUSIONS OF LAW   This case arises under Section 2-160-030 of the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance, which  provides:  ""No person shall directly or indirectly discriminate against any individual  in hiring ...  discharge  .  .  .  or  any  other  term  or  condition  of employment  because  of the  individual's  .  .  .  disability.""  It  is  Complainant's  burden to  prove,  by a  preponderance of the  evidence,  that  her  disability motivated the Respondent to discharge her.  See, e.g., Luckett v.  Chicago Dept. ofAviation,  CCHR No. 97-E-115 (Oct. 18, 2000).  A disability is defined under the Regulations implementing  the Human Rights Ordinance as ""a determinable physical or mental characteristic which may result  from  disease,  injury,  congenital  condition of birth,  or functional  disorder.""  Part  100(11).  The  definition also includes ""the perception of such a characteristic.""  Id.  The Commission has held that  to be actionable, the medical condition must not be insubstantial or transitory.  See, e.g., Jacobs v.  White Cap,  Inc., CCHR No. 96-E-238/239 (July 29, 1997).  Complainant's initial burden is to prove  that:   She is  a member of the  protected class (a person with a disability or perceived as  such);   She was performing her job to her employer's legitimate expectations;   She suffered an adverse employment action; and   Similarly situated employees did not suffer the same adverse employment action.   Wehbe v.  Contacts & Specs, CCHR No. 93-E-232 (Nov. 20, 1996); see also McDonnell-Douglas v.  Green, 411  U.S. 792 (1973). 1  Respondent contests each of these elements.   Turning to the first element, Complainant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence  that  she  was  a  person  with  a  disability  or  that  she  was  perceived  as  such.  The  only  detail  Complainant provided about her disability is that it was ""related to [her] head injury.""  Complaint,  '1[11.  This vague  and non-specific  allegation falls  short of the ""determinable physical  or mental  characteristic"" required by the Regulation.  At the hearing, Complainant testified that she told her  employer she had gotten dizzy, which adds some specificity.  But her dizziness was only a transitory  condition,  which the Commission has  held  insufficient to satisfy the Ordinance.  Jacobs,  supra.  Furthermore,  the  evidence  was  overwhelming  that  Old  Time  Tap  was  never  aware  of  any  ""determinable"" medical condition that would meet the definition.  There is  no evidence that any  agent of Old Time Tap learned anything about VanDyck's December 10 injury other than that she  had  become  dizzy  and  hurt  her  head.  There  is  simply  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  Don  Jones  perceived VanDyck as someone with a determinable non-temporary medical characteristic of any   Under the McDonnell·Douglas method of proof, if a complainant establishes a prima facie case of   discrimination, the respondent then has the  burden of articulating a non·discriminatory basis for  its actions.  The  burden then shifts back to complainant to  prove that the basis offered by the respondent is pretextual.  See, e.g.,  Prewitt v.  John  0. Butler Co., CCHR No.  97.£-42 (Dec. 6, 2000); Adams v.  Chicago Fire Department, CCHR No.  92-E-72 (Sept. 20,  1995).   4   •    sort.  Complainant has  not  proved  the  first  element of her prima facie  case,  and  therefore  her  complaint must be dismissed.   If we were to address the remaining elements of the prima facie case, Complainant would  prevail  on  the  second  but  lose  on  the  third  and  fourth.  Although  Respondent  presented  some  testimony suggesting that VanDyck was not always  sufficiently attentive to the customers of Old  Time Tap, the hearing officer found that she was performing her job to her employer's reasonable  expectations.  Thus, she met her burden on the second element of proof of her prima facie case.   As  for the  third element,  it  is  highly disputed  whether Complainant suffered  an  adverse  employment action when she was replaced.  She testified that she attempted to advise her employer  that she was  ready to  return to  work on December 21,  but Don Jones recalled receiving no such  message.  As noted above, both witnesses were very credible.  The hearing officer was unable to give  the testimony of one witness more weight than the other.  While the hearing officer had the distinct  impression  that  Van  Dyck  sincerely  believed  she  spoke  directly  with  Don  Jones  on or  before  December 21, and that he told her she was a ""risk and a liability,""  Don Jones was found equally  credible in denying any such conversation.  In fact, he denied making any decision to replace Van  Dyck and explained that her position was filled first by another bartender with more seniority and  then by the  bartender who returned from  maternity leave.  Because the evidence on this  point is  evenly matched,  the  Complainant has  failed  to establish this  element by a preponderance of the  evidence, as  required for her to prevail.   With regard to the fourth element, the treatment of similarly-situated workers, Complainant  did not present evidence that any comparable employee at Old Time Tap was treated better than she  was in similar circumstances.  Again, she failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she  was treated differently from employees without a perceived or actual disability.   In  summary,  the  hearing  officer  concluded  that  Complainant  did  not  establish  by  a  preponderance of the evidence that she was fired because of a disability or perceived disability, and  her  complaint  should  be  dismissed.  The  Commission  accepts  and  adopts  the  hearing  officer's  recommended findings  of fact  as  well  as  her conclusion that Complainant has failed to meet her  burden of proof that she was subjected to discrimination based on perceived disability.   IV   Conclusion   For these reasons, the Commission adopts the hearing officer's recommendations and finds   for Respondent.   c:;:s::C M   JAW.\)   By:   Dana V.

In mid-August, our private contractor will begin the work to install a new sewer in S.  Vernon Avenue (81st Street-80th Street), in E. 80th Street (Vernon-St. Lawrence), in S. Evans  Avenue (81st Street-80th Street), and in E. 80th Street (Evans-Champlain).  The old sewer  dates back to 1913 and needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will  be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    6th Ward Office: 773-635-0006    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Randy Conner  Commissioner of Water Management

Daley  Mayor  Steven J. Lux  City Comptroller  March 14, 2008  BENEFITS BULLETIN  IT’S TIME FOR SPRING SCHOOL TERM   PROOF OF STUDENT STATUS  If your continuous service date shows you were hired on or after August  1,  1984,  and  if  you  are  not  a  sworn  police  officer  or  a  uniformed  firefighter,  medical  benefits  for your eligible dependent(s) will terminate at midnight prior to their 19th birthday.  Medical benefits can be extended until their 22nd birthday, if you submit satisfactory “proof of student status” in both the Spring and Fall each year (within required time frame) confirming  that  your  eligible  dependent(s)  are  full-time students at an accredited college or university.  Important  Note: The  student’s  school  determines  the  definition of full-time.  Dental  benefits  will  terminate  for  your  eligible  dependent(s) at midnight prior to their 19th birthday whether they are full-time students or not.   Call  the  Health  Care  Services  Corporation (HCSC)  at  1-888-541-7107  to find  out  more  about continuation  of  dental  and/or  medical  coverage through the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) program.  If you are a sworn police officer or a uniformed firefighter, or  if  your  continuous  service  date  shows  you  were  hired before August  1,  1984,  proof  of  student  status  is  not required for your eligible dependents.  For  complete  details  about  dependent  age  limits  for medical  and  dental  benefits, please  visit  the  “general information”  section  of  the  Benefits  Management Division  website  www.cityofchicago.org/benefits and click on the words: Frequently Asked Questions.  Important Reminder: The deadline for the current Spring school term proof of  student status for continuation of medical benefits is Monday, March 31, 2008. The following two documents must be submitted to the Benefits Management Division  twice a year or your eligible dependent(s) will not have medical benefits through the  City of Chicago for the full calendar year:  1) Original letter dated after 2/1/08 from the school’s Registrar’s Office confirming  full-time student status for the current school term.  2) Copy of full or partially paid tuition bill or grants for the current school term.  (SEE REVERSE SIDE)  3/08  UNDERSTANDING PROOF OF STUDENT STATUS GUIDELINES  • The letter from the school’s Registrar’s Office is often issued on the school’s  multicolored letterhead or has a raised seal. It cannot be a photocopy or a facsimile (fax). It cannot be dated prior to February. 1, 2008 for the current Spring school term. It must state the student is enrolled on a “full-time” basis.  • The student’s name must appear on the copy of full or partially paid tuition bill or  grants for the current school term.  Various forms of proof of payment are acceptable including a copy of the student’s grant letter or student account printed from the Internet. The bill must be at least partially paid.  UNDERSTANDING FAMILY STATUS CHANGE GUIDELINES  If you wish to add or drop an eligible dependent from your coverage, you must wait until the annual open enrollment period unless you experience a qualifying Family Status Change during the year:  Examples of family status changes  include the following:  Here are some examples of changes NOT considered family status changes:  • your marriage or divorce • your enrollment or termination of an eligible  domestic partner  • birth or adoption of a child • death of a spouse or covered dependent • a covered dependent reaching the   limiting age, or   • a change in employment status for you   or your spouse  You must submit an enrollment form to the Benefits Management Division to add/delete within 30 days  of family status changes. You must also submit acceptable documentation to support the change in coverage within 60 days of your request.  1) You get married but you don’t notify the  Benefits Management Division for six months. Since you didn’t request coverage for the spouse within 30 days of your marriage, you will have to wait until the next open enrollment period to add your new spouse.  2) You decide that you no longer want coverage  for your children. Since this is not a family status change, you’ll have to wait until the next open enrollment period to drop coverage for your children.  IMPORTANT REMINDER IF YOU DIVORCE YOUR SPOUSE:  You Must Drop All Ineligible Dependents Including Divorced Spouses Or   You Will Be Billed The Cost Of Coverage And/Or Risk Financial Consequences.  3/08

By mid January 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 5,541 feet of new 8-inch water main in W. Fifth  Avenue, from S. Kostner Avenue to W. Harrison Street, S. Tripp Avenue, from W. Harrison Street to  W. Arthington Street, S. Kedvale Avenue, from W. Fifth Avenue to W. Arthington Street and   W. Harrison Street, from S. Pulaski Road to S. Springfield Avenue. The old water main dates back to  1893, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  24th Ward Office: 773-533-2400  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

After  reviewing  relevant  law  and  after  conferring  with  the Department  of  General  Services  (DGS),  the  Board  has  determined  that  the Governmental Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit you from purchasing a City-owned lot under ANLAP.   FACTS:    The facts upon which our opinion is based come from your letter, staff conversations with you, our review of ANLAP’s enabling ordinance, and consultation with the Department of General Services.   ANLAP is administered by DGS.  Under the enabling Ordinance which established this program, homeowners in certain areas of the City may purchase City-owned vacant  lots  for  less  than  market  value.    In  order  to  qualify  for  ANLAP,  the prospective buyer must own and occupy the property immediately adjacent to the vacant lot; the vacant lot must be zoned residential; the appraised fair market value of the vacant lot must not exceed $10,000; and the prospective buyer must not be delinquent in the payment of real estate taxes or have any outstanding debt with the City of Chicago.  The minimum bid for purchase of property under this program is $300.00.  Upon receipt of a bid for property under ANLAP, DGS sends notice by regular and certified mail to the owners of the other properties adjacent to the lot in question,  informing  the  owners  of  the  bid,  without  revealing  the  amount,  and providing them with an opportunity to submit a sealed bid for the parcel for a period of thirty days from the date of the mailing of the notice.  The bids are then opened by the Department at a public meeting convened before a certified court reporter. All bids which conform to the requirements of ANLAP are then referred to the City Council committee having jurisdiction over the disposition of City-owned real estate, which then holds a public hearing.  The City Council may accept the higher bid by a majority vote, or may reject both bids by a vote of three-quarters of its members.   You state that you have already submitted a minimum bid of $300.00 to purchase the lot  at  [1234  Avenue].    DGS  has  informed  Board  staff  that  you  meet  all  the requirements for submitting this bid under ANLAP.  The Department also states that it sent notice to the owner of the other adjacent property ([1235 Avenue]) informing him of your bid and that this letter was returned as undeliverable.  The Department of  General  Services  confirmed  that  it  has  concluded  the  owner  of  the  adjacent property is not the occupier of the property, and is therefore not qualified to bid under ANLAP.  The Department also reports that the lot has an appraised value of “over $5,000.00.”  Finally, you have stated that as an employee of the Department  Case No. 00010.A June 14, 2000 Page 2   of [          Y                ], you do not participate in the making of any decisions concerning ANLAP, nor do you have occasion to be involved in any aspect of the ANLAP program.   LAW:      The  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  provision  most  relevant  to    your  case  is  Sec.  2-156-110 (Interest in City Business). This provision states that:   ...Unless sold pursuant to a process of competitive bidding following public notice, no elected official or employee shall have a financial interest in the purchase of any property that (i) belongs to the City, or (ii) is sold for taxes or assessments, or (iii) is sold by virtue of legal process at the suit of the City.    Sec. 2-156-010(l) of the Ordinance defines “financial interest,” in relevant part, as any interest with a cost or present value of $5,000.00 or more.  ANALYSIS:     Under these provisions, then, City employees are prohibited from having a financial interest in the purchase of City property unless it is sold through a process of competitive bidding after public notice has been given.  Assuming for purposes of this opinion that the reported assessed property value of “over $5,000.00"" is its “present value” within the meaning of Section 2-156-010(l), your purchase of the property would be prohibited under Section 2-156-110, unless sold pursuant to public notice and competitive bidding.1  It is the Board’s opinion that the property sold through the ANLAP procedures described above meet both these requirements of the Ordinance.  Under ANLAP, city-owned vacant lots may only be purchased by the owner/occupier of the adjacent property–in this case, yourself and an owner/occupier of [1235 Avenue]. Therefore, public notice of the opportunity to purchase the vacant lot need only be given to those individuals who meet the requirements under ANLAP.  The public notice requirement of the Ordinance was fulfilled when the Department of General Services sent the owner of the [1235 Avenue] property a letter informing him of your bid.  At that point, the process of competitive bidding also began, as this individual, if qualified, could have also bid for the property.   The fact that this individual was not qualified to bid is no more relevant that if he had been qualified to bid, but chose not to.   The Board concludes that the [1234 Avenue] property is being sold pursuant to a process of competitive bidding following public notice, and that City employees are not prohibited from purchasing such property under Sec. 2-156-110.  Finally, although you have stated that as an employee of the Department of [            Y         ], you have no occasion to be involved in any aspect of the ANLAP program, we caution you that under Sections 2-156- 030(a) and 080(a), you would be prohibited from making, participating in making, or using your position with the City to influence any City decision or action relating to your purchase of the lot in question.    DETERMINATIONS:     The Board determines that the Governmental Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit  1The Board is not concluding or determining that a property’s “assessed value” is its “present  value” for purposes of interpreting Sec. 2-156-010(l) and -110.    Case No. 00010.A June 14, 2000 Page 3  your purchase of the [1234 Avenue] property under the ANLAP program.  The Board’s determination is based on the application of the Ordinance to the facts recited in this opinion.

By late November 2015, the Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark  Construction Company crews will begin the work to install 2,375 feet of new 8-inch water  main in S. Yates Boulevard, from 190’ south of E. 79th Street to 117’ north of E. 83rd Street.  The old water main dates back to 1896, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to www.buildinganewchicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply  enter your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this  letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:     •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  7th Ward Office: 773-731-7777  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for several  minutes.  The aerator screens located at the tip of your faucets should be removed prior to  flushing.    This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, or any  particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line as a result of  the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.

Malcolm X College is located just  south of the United Center, which is  home of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago  Blackhawks.  The areas north and  west of the United Center are primar- ily residential, and include two large  redevelopment sites on former CHA  land.  Jackson Square at West End will  ultimately replace the former Rockwell  Gardens/Maplewood Courts high-ris- es with mixed income housing, while  the West Haven community will do  the same at the former Henry Horner  Homes site.     The Near West Planning Area is served  by ten CTA and two Metra stations.   Eighteen parks offer open space for the  public, and residents are served by two  public libraries.  There are a plethora of  health service providers, including Rush  University Medical Center, Stroger  Hospital of Cook County, the University  of Illinois Hospital, Mile Square Health  Center, and Near West Family Health  Center, among others.  Leadership for  the area is provided by a number of  business and resident organizations,  such as the Near West CDC, Connect- ing4Communities and the Industrial  Council of Nearwest Chicago, among  many others.      NEAR WEST  HISTORY AND  COMMUNITY  ASSETS  The Near West Planning Area is unique  among Chicago’s16 Planning Areas in  that it fits within a single community  area, yet this small section of the city is  packed with a diverse mix of residents,  institutions, manufacturers, offices,  and entertainment.  With over 116,000  area jobs, the Near West is one of only  two planning areas - the Central Plan- ning Area being the other - with more  jobs than residents.  After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,  over 200,000 Chicagoans relocated to  the area, creating teeming neighbor- hoods largely based on ethnicity.  Hull  House was founded by Jane Addams  and Ellen Gates in 1889 to serve these  immigrant populations.  The Great  Migration brought African Americans to  the area, especially during the 1940s  and 1950s,  a period which coincided  with the development of dense public  housing.  The construction of large de- velopment projects, such as the Circle  Interchange, the University of Illinois  at Chicago, the Illinois Medical District,  and the United Center - along with the  much later demolition of public housing  towers - displaced huge numbers of  residents.     Today, the Near West Planning Area  is one of the fastest growing areas  of the city for residents, visitors, and  businesses, benefitting from close  proximity to Chicago’s downtown  business district and from the city’s  transportation network.  The Near   West is bisected by the Eisenhower  Expressway (I-290) running east-west  and by Ashland Ave running north- south down the middle of the area.  The northeast quarter of the area  is facing significant development  pressure for new housing and offices,  while it remains home to over 2,000  businesses in the Kinzie Industrial  Corridor and a major wholesale food  distribution center around Fulton  Market.  Greektown, Randolph Street,  and Madison Street are well known for  their excellent restaurants that attract  patrons from all over the world.    The southeast quarter of the Near  West is dominated by the east and  south campuses of the University of  Illinois at Chicago, the adjoining Uni- versity Village residential development,  and by the Roosevelt Square develop- ment of the Chicago Housing Author- ity’s former ABLA (Addams Brooks  Loomis Abbott) Homes site.  Little  Italy runs through this section along W  Taylor St, while S Halsted St has been  redeveloped along with University Vil- lage as a neighborhood scale shopping  district south of Roosevelt Rd.  The southwest quarter of the Near  West is dominated by the Illinois Med- ical District (IMD), which includes UIC’s  West Campus, Rush University Medical  Center, Stroger Hospital of Cook Coun- ty, Jesse Brown Veteran’s Administra- tion Medical Center, the Cook County  Medical Examiner’s Office, the FBI  Crime Lab, the American Red Cross,  and the Chicago Technology Park.

The Near  West is one of the most racially and  ethnically mixed areas of the city,  with roughly similar white (42%) and  African-American (32%) populations  plus the city’s second-largest Asian  population.  The Near West popu- lation is also economically mixed,  with 39% of its households earning  less than $50,000 per year and  33% of its households earning more  than $100,000 per year.  The area’s  unemployment rate was less than  the city average in 2012 (the latest  year for which planning area-level  data is available): 10.7% vs. 12.9%.   Unemployment has dropped signifi- cantly since then, and this data will  be updated in future iterations of this  Action Plan.

This would  suggest that many consumers visit  the Near West to purchase goods and  services in the food and beverage,  personal care, and eating and drinking  categories.  And they do:  the Near  West is home to the famed Randolph  Street restaurants, the rapidly growing  Fulton Market Area, Greek Town, Little  Italy, and the United Center.  However,  in other categories such as general  merchandise and auto sales and  services, Near West Planning Area  residents would be expected to spend  over $160 million more per year on  these items than the actual area-wide  sales in these two categories.  While  auto sales face some factors that limit  expansion possibilities, such as existing  agreements with dealers, the general  merchandise category may  present an  expansion opportunity for retailers.  Vacancy rates in the Near West Plan- ning Area declined for industrial, office,  and retail space during the eight years  between 2005 and 2013, and anec- dotal evidence suggests that space has  tightened even further over the past  year.  The vacancy rates for industrial /  flex space and office are far below the  city average, while retail vacancies are  around two percentage points higher  than the city as a whole.

The Near West  Planning Area has a lower proportion  of vacant homes than its share of the  city’s housing stock would suggest,  and far fewer homes have gone  through a recent foreclosure than the  city average.

Method of Transportation to Work for Employed Population Aged 16 Years or Older 2012  Most residents of the Near West  Planning Area live close to open  space.  However, they have access  to significantly less acreage per  resident than the City’s goal, which is  5 acres per 1000 residents.  With only  1.2 acres of open space per 1,000  residents, this area has the second  lowest ratio of space to population of  Chicago’s 16 Planning Areas.  Two-thirds of the Near West  Planning Area residents live within a  half-mile from a rail station - nearly  twice as high as the citywide average,  and the third highest ratio among the  16 Planning Areas - yet commuting  by rail is no higher than the citywide  average and 41% of the residents  drive alone in a shorter-than-average  commute.   With over 30 DIVVY bike stations  in the area, biking is the preferred  transportation mode of 2.5% of  commuters, twice the city average.   Perhaps the most significant aspect  of commuting in the Near West Plan- ning Area is that 20.9% of working  residents walk to their jobs, which  is more than three times the city’s  average.

NEAR WEST  EXISTING LAND  USE & RECENT  INVESTMENTS EXISTING LAND USE  Land uses in the Near West Planning  Area are far more evenly mixed than  most other areas of the city.  Much of  the land is owned by a large number of  institutional users dedicated to educa- tion, health care, and entertainment.  In  fact, half of the area’s land is occupied  by commercial, industrial, and public/ institutional uses, which is nearly dou- ble the city’s average usage for these  combined categories.   Not surprisingly, less land is dedicated  to housing and open space than the  city averages, while the presence of the  University of Illinois at Chicago and the  Illinois Medical district mean that far  more land than usual is dedicated to  public institutions.  The Kinzie Corridor  supports very productive manufac- turing uses on the northern end of the  planning area.  However, 10% of land  within the Near West Planning Area  remains vacant, which is higher than  the citywide average.  RECENT INVESTMENTS In recent years, a number of invest- ments have enhanced the built envi- ronment in Near West Planning Area,  including:  •  Morgan Street CTA Station at W   Lake St and N Morgan St.  Chicago’s  first new station in almost two  decades serves the Pink and Green  lines.

This is part of  our approach to renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to  partner with you our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are  well informed about the project. You should know where to call if you have any  questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,345 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Mobile Avenue,  from W. 51st Street to W. 52nd Street, and in S. Mulligan Avenue, from W. 51st Street to  W. 52nd Street. The old pipe dates back to 1922, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Zalewski’s office, and he has made clear we are to  put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood  through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the  project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct  ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program  and our Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

Mobile Avenue, from W. 51st Street to W. 52nd Street, and in S.  Mulligan Avenue, from W. 51st Street to W. 52nd Street.       Reason:  The old main dates back to 1922 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late July 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Mobile and Mulligan outside of our working  hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a  metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic  only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours.  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we  can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                                         ALDERMAN MICHAEL ZALEWSKI   3-1-1   773-582-4444   312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If  you have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also  call Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the  voicemail message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside  of our working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the  workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the  services from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour  notice when this is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old  pipe will break.  They can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If  we do this, we will let you know what is happening, even though we may be unable to  give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be  good neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By  working together, we can complete this important project as friends working for the  improvement of our community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your  neighbors to reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective  response as the only strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood  basis to work with us on practical steps (public and private) to protect your  property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters  to monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for  only the water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while  protecting one of our most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This  means that with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their  water bills.      Homeowner Incentives         Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:   A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the   meter had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit  www.metersave.org, call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account  number ready.  Space is limited based on funding availability and the number of  volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter  complete with the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of  charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to  Water Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1   place inside the home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount  of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this  limited time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise,  Water Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the  sustainability of our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500  gallons per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household  water consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water  consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This  saves 25 gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers  typically use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in  the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use  by 20-50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use  thousands of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save  money and water by preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45  million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could  face severe water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.

By early April 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Joel Kennedy Constructing  Corp. crews will begin the work to install 5,067 feet of new 8-inch water main in N. Broadway,  from W. Thorndale Avenue to W. Foster Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1914, and needs  to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  47th Ward Office: 773-868-4747  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635                   Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.

For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.

By early January 2016, the Department of Water Management (DWM) and Joel Kennedy  Constructing Corp. crews will begin the work to install 602 feet of new 8-inch water main  and 2,978 feet of new 12-inch water main in N. Lincoln Avenue, from W. Lawrence Avenue  to W. Montrose Avenue and W. Wilson Avenue, from N. Lincoln Avenue to N. Leavitt Street.  The old water main dates back to 1892, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to www.buildinganewchicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply  enter your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this  letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:     •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  47th Ward Office: 773-868-4747  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for several  minutes.  The aerator screens located at the tip of your faucets should be removed prior to  flushing.    This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, or any  particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line as a result of  the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.     Sincerely,     Thomas Powers  Commissioner

Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.

In early March, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin  preliminary construction work around Belmont and Springfield. In mid-April, Department  of Water Management crews will begin to install 2,830 feet of 36-inch, 30-inch, and 24-inch  new sewer main in N. Springfield Avenue (Belmont-Barry), in W. Barry Avenue  (Springfield-Davlin Ct.), in N. Davlin Court (Barry-200 feet west of Milwaukee), in N. Davlin  Court (Barry-Wellington), and in N. Harding Avenue (Barry-180 feet south of Belmont). The  old sewer dates back to 1911 and needs to be replaced.     For the duration of our contractor’s work (early March-mid-April), eastbound traffic on  Belmont will be closed. Traffic will be detoured from Kedzie north to Addison, west to  Pulaski, and back to Belmont. Otherwise, when we are working in the street, we may close  it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always be able to reach your home or business.   Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    30th Ward Office: 773-794-3095     DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner

In early December, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 987 feet  of new 6-inch water main, 1,346 feet of new 8-inch water main, 2,510 feet of new 12-inch water  main, and 3,308 feet of new 16-inch water main in E. 41st Street (State-MLK Drive), in E. 42nd Street  (Indiana-Calumet), in S. Calumet Avenue (41st Street-43rd Street), and in S. Prairie Avenue  (Pershing-44th Street). The old water main dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    3rd Ward Office: 773-373-9273    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,335 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Evergreen Avenue, from  N. Homan Avenue to N. Kedzie Avenue, and N. Spaulding Avenue, from W. Hirsch Street to W.  Potomac Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1896, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Maldonado’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                         German physicist Wilhelm Rontgen announced his discovery of x-rays.    The Tootsie Roll was introduced.    The first movie theater opened, charging ten cents for admission.    The modern Olympic Games began in Athens, Greece.    The first car accident occurred, when Henry Wells hit a bicyclist in New York City.    Yosemite became a national park.    ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" was written by John Philip Sousa.                                    EVERGREEN AND SPAULDING AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,335 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Evergreen Avenue, from N. Homan Avenue to N. Kedzie Avenue, and N.  Spaulding Avenue, from W. Hirsch Street to W. Potomac Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1896 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by late March 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Evergreen and N. Spaulding Avenue outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                                            ALDERMAN ROBERTO MALDONADO   3-1-1   773-395-0143   312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  March 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!            "

Tr.  73.  The advertisement  was  the  same as  that  described in paragraph 6.  Resp. Exh. 2.   10.  Mr.  Villegas was a Hispanic male who was  interested in renting Unit 23. Tr. 70.   II.  Sometime after January 13,2011, but before January 24,2011, Villegas viewed Unit   23  through an appointment with MADO. Tr. 84.   12.  On January  24,  2011,  Villegas  came  to  the  MADO  office  and  met  with  Matuwski,  filled out an  application for  Unit 23,  went with Matuwski to  again view  the apartment,  and  said  he would return on January 25,  2011, to pay MADO the security deposit. Tr.  84-85.   13.  On January  25,  2011,  Villegas  returned  to  the  MADO  office  and  gave  Jacques  the  security deposit. Tr.  86.  With the security deposit paid, the apartment was considered by MADO  as  off the market. Tr.  86.  On January 26, 2011, Jacques prepared for Villegas a rental agreement.  Tr.  86-87.  Villegas signed the rental agreement that day. Tr. 87.   2     14.  On January 25,  2011,  Jacques  called another person who  was  interested  in  viewing   Unit 23, told him that the apartment was taken, and cancelled his appointment. Tr.  80,  82.   15.  Complainant Nickey McGhee is  African-American. Comp. Par.  I.   16.  On the  evening  of January  26,  2011,  McGhee  went  to  the  Chicago  Reader's  main  headquarters and acquired a copy of the upcoming issue that was to  be released the next morning  Tr.  15,  74.  McGhee  read  through  the  real  estate  section of the  Chicago  Reader and  saw  the  MADO classified advertisement. Tr.  15-16.   17.  On  the  morning  of  January  27,  2011,  McGhee  called  the  number  listed  in  the  advertisement and spoke  to  a woman he  identified as  Michelle.  Tr.  21,  60.  McGhee made two  calls  to  that  number,  each  lasting  less  than  one  minute.  Tr.  21-22.  Immediately  thereafter,  McGhee went to  1552-54 N.  LaSalle to see  the building.  Tr.  24.  He  testified that he  liked what  he  saw  of the building,  although  the  entrance  was  locked,  and  wanted  the  apartment  because it  was  affordable.  Tr.  24,  26,  27.  He  thereafter  stopped briefly at  the neighboring  cleaners  to  talk  with  a  woman there  about  getting  into the  building before proceeding to  the  MADO office.  Tr.  24, 26, 64.   18.  At  the  MADO  office,  McGhee  introduced  himself to  the  Caucasian  woman  at  the  desk there as  the caller from earlier that morning. Tr. 26.  Upon being asked about 1552-54 rental,  he testified  that the  woman  said  that  ""there's nothing  available.""  Tr.  27.  McGhee  asked  if she  was  sure  because ""the ad just came out,  and  I just called."" Tr.  26-27.  McGhee  claims  that  the  woman then ""said very rudely and abruptly: There's nothing available."" Tr.  27.  McGhee walked  away  feeling,  he  testified,  ""betrayed ...  bitter  and  angry ...  discriminated.""  Tr.  27.  McGhee  says  that  as  a  result  he  lost  time  from  his  work  and  incurred  mental  and  emotional  distress.  Tr.  31.  MADO witnesses testified that it did not employ anyone named Michelle and the only Caucasian  employee who works at the front desk stated she had never seen McGhee. Tr.  94,109.   19.  On  January  27,  2011,  Jacques  prepared  a  Word  document  of current  apartment  listings to be signed by Matuwski, then faxed  it to the  Chicago Reader on Saturday, January 29,  2011,  for  publication  on  February  3,  2011  Tr.  88-89.  The  document  showed  no  available  apartment units at  1552-54 N.  LaSalle. Tr. 89.   20.   In the  first  week of February 2011,  McGhee  returned to  the  MADO  office.  Tr.  29.  The  African-American  woman  at  the  desk,  Jacques,  informed  McGhee  that  there  were  no  vacancies  and instead offered him a list of rentals  in alternate  locations. Tr.  29.  This  list had no  properties  in McGhee's  price range so he  left the office. Tr.  29.  According to Jacques, McGhee  was  asked  if  he  wanted  to  leave  his  name  and  address  in  the  event  there  was  a  subsequent  opening at  1552-54 LaSalle and he declined to do so. Tr. 99-100.   21.  On  November 29,  2011,  MADO  contacted McGhee  and  advised him  it  did  have  a  room  available  at  1552-54  N.  LaSalle.  Tr.  32.  McGhee  declined  to  pursue  this  opportunity  saying ""[I]t's an insult to me after I had to  go through all this .... That would be like going into the  lion's den."" Tr. 32.   III.  APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS   1.  Section 5-8-030 of the Chicago Fair Housing Ordinance states:   3     It  shall  be  unfair  housing  practice  and  unlawful  for  any  owner. .. firm  or  corporation  having  the  right  to  sell,  rent,  lease,  sublease,  or  establish  rules  or  policies for any housing accommodation, within the City of Chicago, or any agent  of any  of these,  or any real  estate broker as  such ...  (C)  to  refuse to  sell,  lease  or  rent, any real estate for residential purposes within the City of Chicago because of  the  race,  color,  sex  gender  identity,  age,  religion,  disability,  national  origin,  ancestry,  sexual  orientation,  marital  status,  parental  status,  military  discharge  status or source of income of the proposed buyer or renter.   2.   In the  Commission of Human  Relations'  Regulations  implementing  the  Chicago   Fair Housing Ordinance, Regulation 420.130 states:   It  is  a violation of the [Chicago Fair Housing Ordinance) for a person to refuse to  sell, rent or lease a dwelling to  a person or to refuse to negotiate with  a person for  the sale,  rental  or leasing of a dwelling because of that person's membership  in a  Protected Class (see Reg.100(26) above).  Such prohibited actions  include, but are  not limited to: ...   (a) 	  Failing  to  accept  or  consider  a  person's  offer  because  of  that  person's   membership in a Protected Class;   (b) 	 Failure  to  sell,  rent or lease a dwelling to,  or failing  to negotiate for  the  sale,  rental  or  leasing  of  a  dwelling  with  any  person  because  of  the  person's  membership in a Protected Class; ...   (c)  Indicating  to  a  person  through  words 	 or conduct  that  the  dwelling  which  is  actually available  for  inspection, sale, or rental has  been sold or rented (or is  otherwise  unavailable)  because  of  the  person's  membership  in  a  Protected  Class; ...   (g) Limiting information to a person by word or conduct regarding suitably priced  dwellings  available  for  inspection,  sale  or  rental  because  of  the  person's  membership in a Protected Class.   3.   Commission Regulation 100(26) defines ""Person"" as:   [O]ne  or  more  individuals,  corporations,  partnerships,  political  subdivisions,  municipal corporations or other governmental units or agencies associations, labor  organizations, unincorporated organizations, trustees in cases under Title 11  of the  United States Code, receivers,  trustees or other fiduciaries,  and any successors or  assigns thereof.   4. 	  Commission Regulation 100(27) defines ""Protected Class"" as:   [O]ne  or  more  of the  following:  race,  color,  sex,  gender  identity,  age,  religion,  disability,  national  origin,  ancestry,  sexual  orientation,  marital  status,  parental  status, military discharge status, or source of income.   4     IV.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW   l.   McGhee  is  a  member  of  a  protected  class  and,  if  denied  housing  by  MADO   because of his race, would be protected by Section 5-8·030.   2.   In  order  to  establish  a  prima  facie  case  of  racial  discrimination,  a  protected  complainant  has  to  show  that  ""the  landlord  knew  of the  complaint's  interest  in  apartment  in  question  and the  landlord ...  rejected  the  person  while  the  property  was  available.  Leadership  Council for Metropolitan  Opera  Communities  v.  Souchet,  CCHR No.  98-A-107  (Jan.  17,  2001)  at  p.  8 [emphasis the decision's].  As  the Commission stated in Lopez v.  Arias,  CCHR No.99-H­ 12,  (Sept.  20,  2000)  at  p.  7:  ""There  can  be  no  discriminatory  refusal  to  rent  when  there  is  nothing available to rent.""   3.   At the  time McGhee  first  made contact with MADO  with  respect to  renting  Unit  23,  that  apartment,  which  was  the  only  available  apartment  in  the  building,  had  already  been  rented.  While it is  possible that he was  mistakenly told that Unit 23  was available on January 27,  2011,  during  one  of  his  two  under-one-minute  telephone  calls,  the  evidence  established  unequivocally that all  units  in  the  LaSalle building were occupied as  of January 25,  2011.  As  a  result, there has been no discriminatory refusal to rent in violation of Section 5-8-030.   4.   There  is  additional  evidence  here  which  buttresses  the  absence  of  racial  discrimination:  the  lack of credibility to  McGhee's  account of his  telephone conversations  with  MADO,  the  racial  composition  of the  tenant  population  at  1552-54  LaSalle,  and  McGhee's  February 2011  refusals to pursue the opportunity of renting a unit at  1552-54 LaSalle.   V. DISCUSSION   McGhee claims that MADO discriminated against him because he was  African-American  when  it  did not allow him to  rent  an  apartment at  1552-54 N.  LaSalle  in January 2011.  In  order  for  McGhee to prevail on this  claim,  as  previously  noted,  he has  to  show  that an  apartment  was  available  to  rent  at the  time he  sought  to  rent  it.  Without  this  basic  starting  point,  there  would  was  no housing for  MADO to deny McGhee because of his race and,  therefore, a refusal  to  rent  because of the race of the proposed renter would have been impossible.   The  undisputed  evidence  demonstrates  that  all  of  the  units  at  1552-54  N.  LaSalle,  including  Unit  23,  had  been  rented  as  of  January  25,  2011.  While  the  Chicago  Reader did  contain  an  advertisement  for  showing  the  availability  of  Unit  23  as  of  that  date,  this  advertisement resulted from  its  placement the  prior week consistent with  MADO's practice and,  no  doubt,  the  Reader's requirements.  It did  not guarantee that an  apartment would be available  on the date of publication and, as  is  true of all such housing advertisements, the seller or landlord  was  free  to rent or sell  the property in  question prior thereto.  That is  what occurred in this case.  Villegas  had  already  rented  Unit  23  and  that  unit  was  off the  market before  McGhee  sought to  rent it.   In light of the foregoing analysis, it is not necessary to  resolve the credibility dispute as  to  the content of McGhee's January 27, 2011, telephone calls to  MADO.  The hearing officer found  McGhee's  testimony  about  those  calls,  however,  to  suspect.  McGhee  asserted  that  MADO's  representative not  only informed him that Unit 23  was  available but, additionally, described that  unit  and  its  ""amenities""  and  provided  him  with  directions  to  the  MADO  office.  The  hearing  officer  found  it  unlikely  that such  a detailed  discussion could have  occurred  in  the  49- and 46­  5     second-long telephone calls reflected on McGhee's phone records.  Moreover, the absence of any  MADO  employee  named  Michelle,  the  failure  of the  only  Caucasian  MADO  desk employee to  recognize McGhee and  the normal  MADO business practices of checking to  insure that a unit  is  available  prior  to  representing  that  it  is  and  only  scheduling  an  apartment  viewing  when  a  MADO  representative  is  available  all  militate  against  McGhee's  version  of  the  January  27  telephone conversations and his subsequent actions that day.   The hearing  offtcer  also  pointed  out  that  the  mixed  racial  composition  of those  persons  renting  apartments  at  1552-54  N.  LaSalle  in  January  2011  as  well  as  MADO's  subsequent  representations to  McGhee that he could rent an  apartment at either 1552-54 N.  LaSalle or at any  other  of  its  rental  locations  provide  additional  considerations  for  finding  that  the  account  of  events  given  by  MADO  witnesses  was  credible  and  that,  accordingly,  there  was  no  racial  animus.   The  Commission  reviews  a  hearing  officer's  proposed  findings  of  fact  pursuant  to  Section  2-120-510(1)  of the  Chicago  Municipal  Code,  which  provides  in  pertinent  part:  ""The  commission  shall  adopt  the  findings  of  fact  recommended  by  a  hearing  officer. .. if  the  recommended findings  are not contrary to  the  evidence presented at  the hearing.""  This  standard  of review  takes  into  account  that  the  hearing  officer  has  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  the  testimony and demeanor of witnesses.  Poole  v.  Perry  &  Assoc., CCHR  No.  02-E-161  (Feb.  15,  2006);  see also  McGee  v.  Cichon,  CCHR  No.  96-H-26  (Dec.  30,  1997).  The Commission will  not  re-weigh  a  hearing  officer's  recommended  findings  of  fact  unless  they  are  against  the  manifest  weight  of the  evidence.  Stovall  v.  Metroplex  et  al.,  CCHR  No.  94-H-87  (Oct.  16,  1996); Wiles  v.  The  Woodlawn Organization et al., CCHR No.  96-H-1  (Mar.  17,  1999).   Here, the Commission finds  that the hearing officer's factual findings  in this case are not  against  the  manifest  weight  of  the  evidence,  and  the  hearing  officer's  conclusions  from  the  evidence are consistent with applicable law.   VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION   In  conclusion,  the  hearing  officer  recommended  a  finding  that  Complainant  Nickey  McGhee  has  not established  by  a  preponderance  of the  evidence  that  MADO  Management  LP  violated the Chicago Fair Housing Ordinance.  The Board of Commissioners accepts  and adopts  the  recommendation  that  Complainant has  not  proved  by  a  preponderance  of the  evidence that  Respondent violated the  Chicago Fair Housing  Ordinance.  Accordingly,  the Commission finds  in favor of Respondent and the Complaint in this matter is  DISMISSED.

In November, the Department of Water Management’s crews will begin the work to install a  new sewer main in S. Perry Avenue, from Marquette to 68th Street. The old sewer dates  back to 1885 and needs to be replaced.     We will require the full and continuous closure of Marquette Road at Perry for about one  week. Traffic will be detoured and signs will be posted in advance.  Otherwise, when we are  working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons.  Outside of working  hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.  You will always be able to reach  your home or business.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    6th Ward Office: 773-635-0006    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.

That’s the year the old water main  was installed beneath your street. Among other things:                 VICTORIA WOODHULL        Bloomingdale’s department store opened in New York City.    Thomas J. Martin patented the fire extinguisher.    Charlotte Ray, the first African American female lawyer, graduated from   Harvard University.     Arbor Day was celebrated for the first time, in Nebraska.    The Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College began its first academic   session. The university was later renamed Virginia Tech.     Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to be nominated for President of  the United States, although she was a year too young to quality and did not  appear on the ballot.    CULLERTON WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,715 feet of 8- inch water main in W. Cullerton Street, from S. Racine Avenue to S. Sangamon Street.       Reason:  The old main dates back to 1872 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late August 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Cullerton outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in  place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours.  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we  can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN DANIEL SOLIS   773-523-4100                             ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021            FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS     What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If  you have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also  call Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the  voicemail message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside  of our working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the  workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late August  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the  services from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour  notice when this is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old  pipe will break.  They can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If  we do this, we will let you know what is happening, even though we may be unable to  give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be  good neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By  working together, we can complete this important project as friends working for the  improvement of our community.                         DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your  neighbors to reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective  response as the only strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood  basis to work with us on practical steps (public and private) to protect your  property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters  to monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for  only the water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while  protecting one of our most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This  means that with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their  water bills.      Homeowner Incentives         Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:   A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the   meter had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit  www.metersave.org, call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account  number ready.  Space is limited based on funding availability and the number of  volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter  complete with the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of  charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to  Water Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1   place inside the home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount  of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this  limited time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise,  Water Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the  sustainability of our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500  gallons per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household  water consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water  consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This  saves 25 gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers  typically use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in  the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use  by 20-50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use  thousands of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save  money and water by preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45  million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could  face severe water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the  Chicago Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water  from Lake Michigan.               Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!

Harrison.  While the final denial letter references a previous denial letter based primarily   due to law enforcement and deleterious impact bases this final denial was solely based on   the position that the issuance of this tavern license would tend to create a law   enforcement problem.  The applicant filed a timely Notice of Appeal and this matter   proceeded to a de novo hearing before this Commission.  The applicant was represented   by attorney Roderick Sawyer and the City of Chicago was represented by Daniel   Rubinow and Jamie Zehr.           The City presented the testimony of 11th District Police Commander Penelope   Trahanas.  She has been a Chicago Police Officer for 24 years and has been Commander   of the 11th District since August of 2009.        1      In her position as 11th District Commander she received a request for comment on   this application for a liquor license at this location.  In response to this request she wrote   a letter in objection to the issuance of this license.  She identified City’s Exhibit 1, as that   letter she wrote in opposition.          The witness described the 11th District as originally the most violent district in the   city.  It is number one in homicides.  The 3601 West Harrison location is in the   immediate are of a known gang conflict area.  That is an area established by an analysis   group to identify certain areas within the city where there is a high amount of crime and a   high propensity for violence.           The witness detailed several reasons for her opposition to the license.  The first is   that the area has a high number of parolees living in the area.  Two gangs are   continuously involved and outside manpower requests are continuously made to cover   the area.  One block east of the applicant’s location is a liquor store that has issues with   people loitering and hanging out.  She believes a liquor license one block away would   only add to the issues already in the area.  There has not been violence immediately   connected to the liquor store, but the loitering, drug dealing and prostitution are already   issues.  Her concern is that a tavern one block away will exacerbate that issue.  The   issuance of this license would deplete the limited manpower.  The 11th District is already   short on manpower.  Closing time is when traditionally the time for shootings and fights.    As part of her response, she ran statistics that showed in the last quarter of 2009 in that   area there were 27 arrests for narcotics, 13 arrests for soliciting, 2 arrests for unlawful use      2   of weapon, 1 arrest for criminal damage, and one arrest for gambling.  The statistics also   showed an additional 59 calls for service which included shots fired, robberies and other   disturbance calls.          Commander Trahanas opined there was an additional law enforcement problem   with this application because the original application was for a sports bar and grill which   was a misrepresentation and would have had an unsecured area of access.  She is   uncertain if this issue has been remedied.          The Commander testified to a meeting with three community residents who were   concerned with a license issuing because there had been several nights where shots were   fired from the rooftop which concerned them this would be a gang hangout.  The   Alderman also expressed concerns about the attraction this location would become for   gang members.          On cross, Commander Trahanas described the applicant’s location as mostly   industrial with the only business open after 5 o’clock being the liquor store. She does not   believe the reason for the arrests in the area was that the area was abandoned and did not   believe criminals would find it easier to commit crimes in abandoned areas. She does not   consider a bar, a bar licensed by the City of Chicago, to be a reliable business.  A   business which would attract the well-known gang element and the parolees in the area to    come and drink alcohol is not a benefit to her district.  She admitted a McDonald’s is in   the district and that gang members have been arrested at McDonald’s but added      3   McDonald’s does not serve alcohol and gang bangers do not congregate there for long   periods of time.  Commander Trahanas admitted she assumed the gang bangers would   congregate at the applicant’s location.  While the Commander would not agree she is not   in favor of any alcoholic places in the 11th District she could not think of one place that   serves alcohol in the 11th District that she feels is a viable business.  She did admit the   most common call for service was for narcotics and these calls came in both high-traffic   and low-traffic areas.  This area is one of the volatile areas in the district.  This type of   business will attract the negative influences she is trying to remove.  She does not believe   a liquor establishment would attract others from the community and believes there are   wonderful decent people in the 11th District afraid to come out because of negative   influences.  She did admit she did not know if neighbors would support a liquor   establishment.           The Commander repeated her opinion that this establishment would have an   adverse impact on the community and would increase the risk of people violating the law   as well as increase noise and congestion in the area.  She did not do an investigation of   her own into the applicant and the officer holders of the applicant.          On re-direct, Commander Trahanas attributed loitering and violence and police   action to the open liquor store one block from the applicant’s location.  Her opinion is   that if there was no liquor store that activity would go away.  That opinion was based on   precedents of closing liquor stores with the results being an end to loitering in this area.    If there is no license at 3601 W. Harrison there is no place for gang bangers to hang out      4   and less violence.  She did add that there is a fast food location adjacent to 3601 W.   Harrison that is open and has been open.  She cannot recall the hours of operation or if it   is a sit-down restaurant but she believes the people applying for this liquor license   operate that restaurant.  There have been no police issues at that restaurant location.          The Municipal Code of the City of Chicago allows for the denial of an application   for a liquor license if its issuance would “tend to create a law enforcement problem.”    The Municipal Code did not define what this term meant and until recently no case law   discussed its meaning.  In the case of Vino Fino Liquors, Inc. v. The License Appeal   Commission of the City of Chicago, 1-07-3269 (First District – Second Division,   Appellate Court of Illinois).  Justice Theis reviewed the ordinance in its entirety and   stated:                                                                   Examination of the broader context and scheme of this   portion of the ordinance discloses that the City’s intent is   to prohibit the issuance of a license to individuals and   entities controlled or owned by individuals who have a   prior history of disobeying liquor laws and the law in general.    The ordinance requires the applicant to disclose all of the   information so that the LLCC can examine the relevant   individuals’ history to make this determination.  The purpose   of these measures is to promote the City’s goal of protecting   public health and safety (See 235 ILCS 5/1-2 West 2006).    Thus, to deny a license to an applicant who would “tend to   create a law enforcement problem” is to deny a license to an   applicant who would not obey liquor control laws generally   or who would impede enforcement of those laws.    Applying that definition to the facts of this case would require that this   Commission reverse the decision of the LLCC.  This is a de novo hearing and there must   be evidence in the record that would prove the basis for denial.  The evidence in this      5   record from Commander Trahanas does not meet the City’s burden of proof that this   applicant would not obey liquor control laws generally or would impede enforcement of   those laws.          There remains the question of whether the Appellate Court’s ruling limits denial   of an application for a liquor license on the basis that the issuance of the license would   tend to create a law enforcement problem to fact situations in which the City can meet its   burden that the applicant would not obey liquor control laws generally or who would   impede enforcement of those laws.  If that is the law, denial of an application of a liquor   license under this criteria would require specific evidence about the background of the   applicant that would prove the applicant would not obey the law.  It would prevent the   City from ever using this basis to deny an application based on circumstantial evidence   and opinion evidence from law enforcement officials.  The City could never deny an   application based on the type of evidence presented in this case.  With all due respect to   the Appellate Court this Commission feels that the Municipal Code does allow the City to   proceed with a denial of an application on the law enforcement basis without needing to   prove the applicant would tend to break the law.  To require such evidence in all cases   dealing with law enforcement denials would limit the City’s ability to promote its goal of   protecting the public health and safety.           The issue now becomes whether the testimony of Commander Trahanas was   sufficient for the City to have met its burden of proof that the issuance of this license at   this address to this applicant would tend to cause a law enforcement problem.  It seems      6   logical to include within that the term the issue of whether the issuance of this license   would also tend to exacerbate existing law enforcement problems.  Commander Trahanas   has testified about the violence and crime throughout the 11th District and has noted in   her testimony the location of this premise is within a “known gang conflict area.”  She   has testified to problems of loitering in the area of a liquor store located about a block   away and she has given her expert opinion based on 24 years of law enforcement   experience that such problems will move to this location if a license issues.  She also   gave her opinion that the issuance of this license would adversely impact the community,   increase the risk of people violating the law, increase noise and congestion and further   deplete police resources.          One must review this testimony from Commander Trahanas in light of other   testimony that she could not think of one reliable business that serves alcohol in the 11th   District.  While she denied being opposed to all alcoholic places in the 11th District that   concept permeated her testimony at this hearing.  There is probably a basis in fact for the   concept that the issuance of any further liquor licenses in the 11th District would tend to   cause law enforcement problems, but that concept is not a reason to deny a license under   the Municipal Code.          Each applicant case must be scrutinized as to the particular facts of that case.  If   the applicant wishes to open a liquor store as opposed to a tavern that fact would be   important. If the applicant did not have a history of operating a fast food restaurant   around the corner from the site of this premise without any police problems, that fact      7   would be relevant.  If the location of the applicant premises was in an area already   plagued with problems with existing taverns, that would be a relevant fact.  If specifics   were given supporting concerns of increased noise and congestion and depletion of police   patrols were given, such facts would be relevant.          Based on the record in this case and dealing only with the facts of this case in the   record, the City failed to meet its burden that the issuance of this tavern license at this   location to this applicant would tend to cause a law enforcement problem.              The decision of the Local Liquor Control Commission is reversed.    COMMISSIONER SCHNORF’S CONCURRING OPINION       I concur with the decision that the denial of this application is reversed and find   that the Vino Fino case controls this case.                                   8   THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED That the said order or action of the      Local Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago be and the same hereby is     REVERSED.     Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a petition for rehearing may be filed  with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the  mailing of this order is deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an  administrative review action in the Circuit Court, the petition for rehearing must be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order as such petition is a  jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

These appeals are brought before the License Appeal   Commission to challenge revocations, suspensions, or fines of existing liquor licenses by   the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection/Local Liquor Control   Commission.  In these matters, the disciplinary proceedings at the hearing level are   examined, reviewed, and appellate arguments are entertained.  Additionally, our   Commission has reviewing jurisdiction over denials of applications for new liquor   licenses.  Applicants who have been denied their request for a license are entitled to a   trial de novo to determine whether the denial of their application was appropriate.       The License Appeal Commission has collected, through the Department of Finance,   $2,125 in filing fees to date.  The Commission is budgeted for one full-time position.

Sedgwick, 4th Floor, Chicago, IL 60654  Phone 312-744-4111, Fax 312-744-1081, TTY 312-744-1088  www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations                           SETTLEMENT AND MEDIATION             This publication describes some of the rules and procedures at the Chicago Commission on Human Relations  which  apply  to  settlement  of  cases,  settlement  conferences,  and  mediation.    This  information  does  not  constitute legal advice and is not a full statement of the law and procedure that may apply to a given case.    Commission  Policy.    The  Commission  on  Human  Relations  encourages  voluntary  settlement  of  discrimination cases.  However, no party is ever required to settle or to accept particular terms which may be  discussed.  Parties may always discuss and negotiate settlement on their own if both sides are willing.  In  addition,  authorized  Commission  staff  or  an  independent  mediator  appointed  by  the  Commission  may  facilitate settlement discussions.  If an agreement is reached, there are two possible ways to document the  settlement  so  the  case  can  be  closed.    Partial  settlements  are  possible–such  as  settlement  between  a  complainant and one of several respondents.  The Commission’s regulations about settlement are found in  Subpart 230 and printed at the end of this publication.    Staff-Facilitated  Settlement  During  Investigation.    During  the  investigation  of  a  case,  an  assigned  investigator may ask parties if they are interested in exploring settlement and may facilitate settlement  discussions.  The investigator may arrange for parties to meet together at the Commission’s office if they are  willing.  If a party makes a settlement offer through the investigator, the investigator will communicate the  offer to the other side and seek a response.     Mediators and Mediation.  Mediation (sometimes called conciliation) is a process calling for parties to work  together  with  the  aid  of  a  neutral  facilitator  (mediator  or  conciliator)  who  assists  them  in  reaching  a  settlement.  A Commission mediator is a person appointed to conduct a settlement conference or otherwise  attempt to secure a voluntary settlement.  The mediator is not a Commission employee but may be paid as an  independent contractor.  The mediator does not investigate, serve as hearing officer, or participate in any other  way in the adjudication of the same case.  The mediator’s role is advisory and non-binding, as the resolution  of the dispute rests with the parties themselves.  The mediator is authorized to determine how the settlement  conference will proceed.  See Regs. 100(7), 100(8), and 230.110.    Settlement  Conferences.    The  Commission  decides  whether  it  will  hold  a  settlement  conference  in  a  particular case.  A settlement conference may occur at any time while a case is pending, and parties may  request a settlement conference.  The purpose of a settlement conference is to discuss whether the parties can  agree to settlement terms which resolve the case without need for further investigation or an administrative  hearing.  An independent mediator, appointed by the Commission, will conduct the conference.  The mediator  may  confer  with  the  parties  together  or  individually  in  an  effort  to  help  them  reach  an  agreement.    A  settlement conference is not a hearing, and parties are not expected to present witnesses or other evidence.  No  formal record is made.  See Regs. 230.110 and 230.120.    Settlement Conference Procedures.  If the Commission decides to schedule a settlement conference, it will  mail  a  scheduling  order  to  the  parties.    The  fact  that  a  settlement  conference  is  scheduled  does  not  automatically postpone any filing deadline or other scheduled proceeding (such as a hearing or pre-hearing  conference) in the case, although the Commission can order postponement.   See Reg. 230.110.    Attendance Requirements. Once a settlement conference is scheduled, all parties must personally attend  unless the Commission issues an order making attendance optional.  A person attending for a business party  must have authority to settle.  Participation of persons other than the parties is in the discretion of the  mediator.  If a party fails to attend, or attends without authority to settle, the Commission may impose  procedural sanctions such as default or dismissal, a fine, and payment of the costs of other parties who were  inconvenienced. See Reg. 230.110 and Subpart 235.    Attorney Participation.  Any party participating in a settlement conference may be represented by an   attorney who attends the conference.  The party must also attend unless the attorney provides documentation  of authority to settle on the party’s behalf.  The attorney must have filed and served an attorney appearance  pursuant to Reg. 270.310, either before or at the beginning of the settlement conference.      Rescheduling a Settlement Conference.   If unable to attend a settlement conference for good cause, it is  necessary to seek a continuance as soon as possible, by filing and serving a written motion pursuant to Reg.  210.320(b).  Forms for preparing this motion and documenting service are available from the Commission or  its web site.  Telephoning is not sufficient to excuse a party from attending.  Although a party should  telephone the Commission if a last-minute emergency arises, the call must be followed up with a written  motion establishing good cause for the absence.  In filing or responding to a motion for continuance, parties  are asked to include information about their availability, to assist the Commission in rescheduling.  The  Commission will issue an order, which will set a new date if the motion is granted.  See Reg. 210.320(c).     Confidentiality of Settlement Discussions.  No mediator or Commission staff member may disclose to the  public the content of settlement discussions.  Nothing that is discussed may be used as evidence in any  investigation or hearing on the merits of the complaint.  A mediator will not disclose to other Commission  personnel the content of settlement discussions the mediator has facilitated, unless the parties consent.  See  Reg. 230.120.    Drafting Settlement Agreements.  During the investigation stage of a case, if the parties agree on settlement  terms,  the  investigator  may  agree  to  draft  a  written  settlement  agreement  for  their  signature  and  the  Commission’s approval.  A mediator may be willing to draft a settlement agreement, especially a brief one.   Parties often take care of the drafting and signing of the written agreement themselves.  In that case, the  Commission may issue an order giving them a deadline to submit the settlement document.  Commission  personnel will not draft private agreements which will not be submitted for Commission approval.  Regardless  of who drafts a written agreement, each party signing it must make sure the draft correctly states the terms the  party has agreed to.        Closing a Settled Case.   Once parties have agreed on settlement terms, Reg. 230.130 describes two ways to  close the case or dismiss a settled claim:      ·   Approved Settlement Agreement.   If the parties want the Commission to approve the settlement   and retain jurisdiction to seek court enforcement of it, they must put the settlement terms in writing.   The Commission has a settlement agreement form which parties may use.  The settlement agreement  must be signed by each party agreeing to the settlement.  An attorney may not sign unless the  agreement includes a signed certification or other documentation that the attorney has authority to  sign the agreement for the client.  The signed settlement agreement must then be submitted to the  Commission for approval.  The Commission will issue an order approving the agreement if it is  “knowingly and voluntarily entered into, unambiguously drawn, capable of being enforced, signed by  persons with authority to do so, and consistent with the ordinance.”  The Commission may also  require that a party submit information to allow the Commission to determine ability to comply.   Private Settlement.  If the parties want to keep the settlement terms private, the complainant (or the  complainant’s  attorney)  can  sign  and  submit  a  withdrawal  pursuant  to  Reg.  210.190.    The  Commission has a form which may be used.  On receiving the withdrawal, the Commission will issue  an order dismissing the settled case or claim.  The Commission will not retain jurisdiction to seek  enforcement  of  the  settlement  and  will  not  reopen  the  case  if  the  agreement  was  not  honored.   However, a party may be able to sue in state court to enforce a private agreement as a contract.      ·       Enforcing an Approved Settlement Agreement.   If a party (usually the complainant) believes an approved  settlement  agreement  was  violated,  the  party  may  proceed  independently  (i.e.  without  Commission  involvement) to enforce the agreement under other applicable law.  Typically, the party would file a civil  lawsuit in state court under principles of contract law.  The party may also ask the Commission to seek       2   enforcement of the agreement.  This is done by filing and serving a written motion, and the procedures are  explained in Reg. 230.140, printed below.  The Commission may fine a party for violating an approved  settlement agreement and may ask the City of Chicago Department of Law to file a complaint in state court to  enforce the agreement on behalf of the Commission.  Successful enforcement results in a civil court judgment  for the amount owed (or possibly an order for specific performance).  The Commission does not attempt to  collect or execute any judgment issued in favor of a party other than the Commission itself, although the party  can proceed independently.           Part 100    (7)   COMMISSION REGULATIONS ABOUT SETTLEMENT AND MEDIATION   “Conciliation” or “Mediation” is a process calling for parties to work together with the aid of a neutral  facilitator–a conciliator or mediator–who assists them in reaching a settlement.  The concilator or mediator’s  role is advisory and non-binding, as the resolution of the dispute rests with the parties themselves.  Where used,  “conciliation” and “mediation” have the same meaning.   General Definitions     (8)   “Conciliator”  or  “Mediator”  means  a  person  designated  by  the  Commission  to  conduct  a  settlement  conference  or  otherwise  attempt  to  secure  a  voluntary  settlement,  but  who  does  not  participate  in  the  investigation, serve as hearing officer, or in any other respect participate in the adjudication of the same case.   Where used, “conciliator” and “mediator” have the same meaning.      Settlement Conference Procedure   Settlement Policy and Settlement Conference     Reg. 230.100    It is the policy of the Commission to encourage the voluntary settlement of complaints, although the Commission shall  not require settlement or particular settlement terms.  Any authorized Commission staff member may facilitate settlement  discussions and draft a settlement agreement reflecting agreed terms for the parties to sign.  The Commission may also  hold a settlement conference pursuant to Reg. 230.110 in an attempt to secure voluntary settlement.    Reg. 230.110    The  Commission  may  schedule  a  settlement  conference  conducted  by  an  independent  mediator  appointed  by  the  Commission.  Unless otherwise agreed by all participating parties, such a settlement conference shall occur no sooner  than 14 days after the date of mailing the scheduling order.  A scheduled settlement conference does not stay proceedings  or constitute an extension of time for any filing unless so ordered.  The mediator shall confer with the parties in an  attempt to secure a voluntary settlement of the complaint.  The mediator is authorized to determine how the conference  shall proceed.  A settlement conference is a scheduled proceeding at which attendance of all parties is mandatory unless  otherwise ordered, and each party must have at least one person in attendance who has authority to settle.  Each party  may be represented by an attorney of record; however, attendance of an attorney only is not sufficient unless the attorney  provides documentation of authority to settle on the party’s behalf.  Participation of additional persons in a settlement  conference is in the discretion of the mediator.  If a party fails to attend a settlement conference or attends without  authority to settle, the Commission may determine what if any sanction is just and proper among the options set forth in  Subpart 235.     Reg. 230.120    Neither a mediator nor the Commission shall disclose publicly the content of any settlement discussions concerning a  Commission case.  No stenographic or other formal record shall be made of settlement efforts at a settlement conference  or elsewhere.  Neither party may use the fact that an offer was made, accepted, or rejected at a settlement conference or  during other settlement discussions as evidence during the investigation or administrative hearing concerning the merits  of the claim under discussion.   Nondisclosure of Settlement Discussions        3   Retained Jurisdiction   No Admission of Violation   Private Settlement   Approved Settlement Agreement   Closure of a Case by Settlement   Reg. 230.130    Parties may settle a claim or complaint either by approved settlement agreement or by private settlement as the parties  may agree.  Settlement closure procedures are as follows:    (i)    If the parties agree to a settlement which they want the Commission to approve with retained jurisdiction to seek  enforcement, the settlement terms must be reduced to writing, signed by the parties, and submitted to the Commission for  approval.  Attorneys may not sign a settlement agreement on behalf of a client unless the attorney or the client includes  with the agreement a signed certification or other documentation that the attorney has authority to sign the agreement on  the client’s behalf.  If the proposed settlement is knowingly and voluntarily entered into, unambiguously drawn, capable  of being enforced, signed by persons with authority do to so, and consistent with the ordinance, the Commission shall  issue an order approving the settlement and dismissing the settled claim or complaint.  The Commission may require as a  condition of approval that any party to a settlement submit such information as the Commission deems necessary to  determine ability to comply.  If the Commission does not approve the settlement, it shall order further appropriate action.    (j)    The Commission shall retain jurisdiction over the case to seek enforcement of an approved settlement agreement as  described in Reg. 230.140.    (k)    Entering into an approved settlement agreement or private settlement is not an admission by any party as to whether an  ordinance violation was committed.    (l)    If the parties agree to a settlement which they want to remain private (i.e., not approved by the Commission), in order for  the Commission to close the case or dismiss the settled claim, the complainant must sign a withdrawal of the complaint or  claim as set forth in Section 210.190.  The Commission shall not retain jurisdiction to seek enforcement of any private  settlement agreement.    Reg. 230.140    If a party believes there has been a violation of an approved settlement agreement, the party may proceed independently  to enforce the agreement under any applicable law.  If the party wishes to invoke the Commission’s retained jurisdiction,  the party must file a motion for enforcement and serve it on all other parties, stating the nature of the alleged violation.   All other parties shall have 14 days from filing of the motion to file and serve a response, unless the Commission issues  an order allowing additional time.  The Commission may conduct an investigation into the alleged violation and may  issue any orders it deems necessary to exercise its retained jurisdiction.  If the Commission finds substantial evidence that  a party has violated the terms of an approved settlement agreement, the Commission shall promptly notify the parties in  writing, may fine any noncompliant party, and may request the Department of Law to seek judicial enforcement in state  court on behalf of the Commission.  If the Commission concludes that substantial evidence of violation of the agreement  is lacking, it shall notify the parties in writing.       Noncompliance with Approved Settlement Agreement        4

In mid-April, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin work to  install a junction structure at the intersection of Pulaski and 60th Street. Following, our in- house crews will install a new sewer in 62nd Street (Hamlin-Lawndale), in Lawndale  Avenue (63rd Street-61st Place), in 60th Street (Pulaski-Springfield), and in Springfield  Avenue (59th Place-61st Street). The old sewer dates back to 1910 and needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.

WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,284 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Buffalo Avenue, from 300’North of  E. 83rd Street to E. 86th   Street.    Reason:  The old main consist of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by mid September 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Buffalo Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS     What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid September  2013. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.   Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  These  screens should be removed prior to flushing.  This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement.  If you have any  questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.         DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Use  this form to determine if your project must comply with the energy code and the Department of Building’s submittal requirements for a building  permit.  Compliance is required for new construction and/or if any of the building components below will be replaced, renovated or modified:      Exemptions:    Mechanical Systems & Equipment (HVAC)   Electrical Power and Lighting    Building Envelope     Service Water Heating             Portions of building that are not conditioned (heated or cooled)  Portions that are separated from the rest of the building by a building envelope assembly and which have a designed peak energy rate usage of less  than 3.4 Btu/h/ft2 (10.7 W/m2) or 1.0 watt/ft2  (W/m2).    Portions of the building that have received landmark designation (typically the envelope only). See 13(18-13-101.4.2) for specific details.   Existing buildings may continue to use and maintain lawfully-installed building systems that are in existence.      •  •   •  •     Step 2: Determine Occupancy Classification   For Chapter 18-13 Energy Conservations purposes, all buildings are classified as either Residential or Commercial.   Buildings that contain  both occupancies are considered Mixed Occupancy.   Residential  Occupancy:   Commercial  Occupancy:  Mixed  Occupancy:   All buildings up to and including four stories in height (above grade) containing any permanent residential occupancy are considered  residential.  Buildings that are up to and including four stories in height (above grade) and contain more than 15% of the building  area in an other occupancy are considered mixed occupancy.  All buildings containing occupancies other than a permanent residential occupancy, as well as all residential buildings that are five  stories or more above grade are considered commercial.    For buildings that contain both a permanent residential occupancy and a commercial occupancy which is more than 15% of the  building total area (as defined above), each occupancy shall conform to the requirements for that type of occupancy.        Use the check boxes below to determine the classification for the project.  YES       NO                           Is the building 5 stories or more above grade?           (cid:131)   If you checked “YES”, please complete the Commercial Compliance Form.                                               Is the building 4 stories or less above grade and contains any permanent residential occupancy, such as houses, apartments, condos, or       dorms (hotel and temporary housing units are not included here)?  (cid:131)   If you checked “YES”, please complete the Residential Compliance Form.                    Is the building 4 stories or less above grade and does it contain any permanent residential occupancy and any other occupancy which   occupies more than 15% of the total building area?

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,584 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Kenton Avenue, from W.  Addison Street to W. Roscoe Street, and in N. Kilbourn Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W.  Roscoe Street. The old pipe dates back to 1909, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Reboyras’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Ariel Reboyras               30th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                    Do you wonder what was happening in 1909?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:               ERROL FLYNN        The first U.S. university school of nursing was established, at the University of   Minnesota.     Joan of Arc was declared a saint.    The first Lincoln head pennies were minted.    The Indianapolis 500 race track opened.    Actor Errol Flynn was born.    Workers began pouring concrete for the Panama Canal.    The first subway car with side doors went into service in New York City.                       WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will install 2,584 feet of 8-inch water main in  N. Kenton Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W. Roscoe Street, and in N. Kilbourn Avenue,  from W. Addison Street to W. Roscoe Street.     Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We expect our work to start shortly, and be completed in late April. Final restoration  will follow in June. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any  appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN ARIEL REBOYRAS   773-794-3095      PETE SCALES   DEPARTMENT OF WATER MANAGEMENT   312-744-8822                        FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late April. Final  restoration will follow in June. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

10744`https://www.cityofchicago.org/dam/city/depts/ethics/general/AO_Lobby/01021AO-redact.pdf`Success`Success`6`6`Not a fillable PDF.`"ADVISORY OPINION To: Re: Date: August 24, 2001  [John] Case No. 01021.A, Lobbying  You are a [sales representative], and an owner of [the company                     ] in Chicago.  In January 2001, you called the Board and asked how the lobbyist registration  and  disclosure  provisions  of  the  City’s  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance would apply to your firm’s proposed activities.  You were advised orally that the Board would consider  your  inquiry fully if you requested an advisory opinion, and that, pending a later resolution by the Board, you and/or your firm’s representatives could meet with City personnel without registering as  a  lobbyist.    On  April  23,  2001,  you  requested  an  advisory  opinion  to determine whether, based on the activities  undertaken as described in this opinion, your firm and/or its representatives must register as lobbyists with the Board.  For the reasons explained below, the Board is compelled to determine that:  1)  your  firm  is  acting  as  a  “lobbyist”  (as  defined  in  the  City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance) by virtue of its representatives’ contact with City employees or officials for the purpose of selling the City  [ services   ] offered through your firm by [a principal company] and 2) therefore,  either your firm, or its representatives individually, are required to register under the lobbyist provisions of the Ordinance; and 3) if the City does not issue a Request For Proposals, but instead elects to purchase [                   ] services directly through your firm, and your firm receives its compensation as a sales commission (i.e., it is paid by [the principal company      ] if and only if the City determines to purchase that company’s products and services through your firm), that compensation constitutes a prohibited contingent lobbying fee, and both your firm and the [principal firm] whose product it sells would violate the Ordinance.   FACTS:  You explained that your firm regularly acts as a sales representative on behalf of any number of [principal companies] whose products and services it is authorized by contract to sell and service.  You said that representatives from your firm would be contacting employees of [the department                 ]  to discuss the City’s possible purchase of [                                                                       services] through your firm.  You  described these services as investment contracts whereby the City would invest cash into an account managed by a [principal company] which would invest the money [                                                        ] at either fixed or fluctuating  interest rates.  You also said that your firm’s representatives  would make these contacts not in response to a published Request for Proposals (RFP) issued by the City, but through uninvited “cold calls”on City employees or officials. You also said that the compensation your firm would receive would be paid fully by the [principal company] whose product is sold, solely on a commission basis. Receipt of this commission depends on whether a sale is made–if there is no  Case No. 01021.A August 24, 2001 Page 2  sale, the firm receives no compensation.  The amount of compensation is determined by how much and at what rate the money is invested, and other factors specific to your firm’s relationship with the particular [principal].  You  were  previously  advised  that  your  firm  could  proceed  with  this  course  of  action  without registering as a lobbyist, and that, if the Board later determined (as it now has) that, by virtue of your firm’s conduct it was a lobbyist, and that registration was required, the firm or its associates could register  at  that  time  without  penalty.  On  June  14,  2001,  you  advised  staff  that  your  firm’s representatives had begun making City contacts, and indications were that the City may well be interested in purchasing products and services sold through your firm.  Further, the City may issue an RFP for these products and services, inviting your firm and four others to bid on it. 1  ISSUES: In this opinion, the Board will address the following questions:  1.  Is your firm (or its representatives individually) acting as a “lobbyist” (as defined in the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance) by virtue of its representatives’ contact with City employees or officials for the purpose of attempting to sell the City an investment contract, and, if so, must the firm or its representatives register under the lobbyist provisions of the Ordinance?  2.  Assuming that: a) your firm is acting as a lobbyist; and b) without issuing an RFP, the City elects to purchase [             ] services through your firm; and c) your firm receives its compensation from the [principal company] in the manner described in this opinion, is that compensation a prohibited contingent lobbying fee under § 2-156-300 of the Ordinance?   RELEVANT LAW:  Section 2-156-210 of the Ordinance, “Persons Required to Register,” provides:  Each lobbyist shall register and file reports with the Board of Ethics as provided in  this  Article.    This  section  shall  extend  to  any  person  who  undertakes  to influence any legislative or administrative action as any part of his duties as an employee of another, regardless of whether such person is formally designated as a lobbyist by his employer.   Section  2-156- 010, “Definitions,” sub-parts (a) and (p), provide, respectively:  (a)  ""Administrative  action""  means  any  decision  on,  or  any  proposal, consideration, enactment or making of any rule, regulation, or any other official nonministerial  action  or  non-action  by  any  executive  department,  or  by  any  1The Board notes here and sincerely appreciates your firm’s desire from the outset to understand and  comply with the standards in the Ordinance.   Case No. 01021.A August 24, 2001 Page 3  official or employee of an executive department, or any matter which is within the official jurisdiction of the executive branch.  (p)  ""Lobbyist""  means  any  person  who,  on  behalf  of  any  person  other  than himself, or as any part of his duties as an employee of another, undertakes to influence any legislative or administrative action, including but not limited to:  (1) a bond inducement ordinance; (2) a zoning matter; (3) a concession agreement; (4) the creation of a tax increment financing district; (5) the establishment of a Class 6(b) Cook County property tax classification; (6) the introduction, passage or other action to be taken on an ordinance, resolution, motion, order, appointment or other matter before the City Council;  (7)  the  preparation  of  contract  specifications;  (8)  the solicitation,  award  or  administration  of  a  contract;  (9)  the  award  or administration  of  a  grant,  loan,  or  other  agreement  involving  the disbursement of public monies; or (10) any other determination made by an elected or appointed City official or employee of the City with respect to the procurement of goods, services or construction; provided, however, that a person shall not be deemed to have undertaken to influence any legislative or administrative action solely by submitting an application for a City permit or license or by responding to a City request for proposals or qualifications.  The term ""lobbyist"" shall include, but not be limited to, any attorney, accountant, or consultant engaged in the above-described activities; provided, however, that an  attorney  shall  not  be  considered  a  lobbyist  while  representing  clients  in  a formal adversarial hearing; and provided further that the term ""lobbyist"" shall not include  a  person  who,  on  an  unpaid  basis,  seeks  to  influence  legislative  or administrative action on behalf of an entity that is not engaged in a profit-seeking enterprise;  further  provided  that  an  employee,  officer  or  director  of  a non-for-profit entity who seeks to influence legislative or administrative action on behalf of such an entity shall not be considered a lobbyist for purposes of this chapter.  Last, Section 2-156-300, “Contingent Fees,” provides:   No  person  shall  retain  or  employ  a  lobbyist  for  compensation  contingent  in whole  or  in  part  upon  the  approval  or  disapproval  of  any  legislative  or administrative  matter,  and  no  person  shall  accept  any  such  employment  or render any service for compensation contingent upon the approval or disapproval of any legislative or administrative matter.   Case No. 01021.A August 24, 2001 Page 4  ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS: A.  Is your firm (or its representatives) acting as, and must it register as, a “lobbyist”?  For the reasons that follow, the Board is compelled to conclude that your  firm  (through  its  representatives)  is  indeed  acting  as  a  “lobbyist”  (as  defined  in  the  City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance) by virtue of its representatives’ contact with City employees or officials for the purpose of attempting to sell the City [                   services], and that therefore the firm or its representatives are required to register as a lobbyist.    1.    Did  your  firm  undertake,  on  behalf  of  another,  to  influence  an  administrative  action?    As delineated above, the Ordinance’s definition of “lobbyist” (which became effective on June 7, 2000), includes any person (such as your firm or its representatives), who, “on behalf of another” (such as [a principal] company), “undertakes to influence administrative action,” specifically including “the preparation of contract specifications, or the solicitation, award or administration of a contract,” or “the award or administration of any other agreement involving the disbursement of public monies,” or “any other determination made by an elected or appointed City official or employee of the City with respect to the procurement of goods, services or construction.”   The City’s purchase of the  [                          products and services] offered by [principal companies        ], as described in this opinion, qualifies as the procurement of services.  We therefore conclude that your firm’s contacts, on behalf of another person, namely the [principal companies    ] whose products and services it is authorized to sell, were undertaken to influence a determination made by employees of [the  department            ] to recommend and create–or not to recommend or create–a contract for the  City’s procurement of the cash management products and services your firm would discuss with City employees.  And, we further conclude, the determination to be made by City employees or officials constitutes “administrative action” as defined by the Ordinance.    2.  Do any of the exceptions to the definition of  lobbyist apply?  The definition of “lobbyist” contains five  exceptions.  In summary, they are: that a person shall not be deemed to have undertaken any legislative or administrative action: i) solely by submitting an application for a City permit or license; or  ii)  solely  by  responding  to  a  City  request  for  proposals  or  qualifications;  iii)  attorneys,  while representing  clients  in  a  formal  adversarial  hearing;  iv)  persons  who,  on  unpaid  basis,  seek  to influence legislative or administrative action on behalf of an entity not engaged in a profit-seeking enterprise; and v) employees, officers or directors of non-for-profit entities who seek to influence legislative or administrative action of behalf of such entities.   Clearly, numbers i, iii, iv and v do not apply to the facts in this case.  As to number ii, you have stated that when your firm scheduled the meeting and met with City employees for the purposes described above, it was “cold-calling,” i.e., there was no RFP to which it was responding. While the City may, partly as a result of your firm’s contacts with City employees, in the future issue an RFP for the procurement of the very products and services your firm discussed with City employees, no RFP was issued at the time your firm had those discussions.  Thus we conclude that this exception does not apply to your firm’s conduct.   3.  Must your firm and/or its representatives register under the lobbying provisions?  As to whether your firm and/or its employees must register as lobbyists, the Ordinance provides in § 2-156-210 that  Case No. 01021.A August 24, 2001 Page 5  “each lobbyist shall register and file reports with the Board of Ethics as provided in this Article.”  The Ordinance exempts only four types of persons from its lobbyist registration provisions.2  None of these, however, apply in this case.  Therefore, we conclude that either your firm must register as a lobbyist (listing in its registration the names of each individual associated with it who will be lobbying or who has lobbied), or those individuals themselves must register as lobbyists, listing as clients your firm and the [principal companies] whose products and services they have discussed or in the future will discuss with City employees or officials.  B.  Would your firm’s compensation be a prohibited contingent lobbying fee? As delineated above,  §  2-156-300  of  the  Ordinance  provides  that  no  person  shall  render  any  service  for compensation  contingent  upon  the  approval  or  disapproval  of  any  legislative  or  administrative matter.  As the Board has already concluded that your firm’s conduct was intended to seek approval of an “administrative action,” and thus lobbying, it remains for the Board to address whether your firm’s  compensation,  as  you  have  described  it,  constitutes  a  prohibited  contingent  lobbying  fee. Black’s Law Dictionary (3d Ed., at 290) defines “contingent” as   possible, but not assured ... conditioned upon the occurrence of some future event which is itself uncertain, or questionable ... This term, when applied to a ... legal right or interest, implies that no present interest exists, and that whether such interest or right ever will exist depends upon a future uncertain event.  You have said that your firm’s only compensation for its efforts to market, put together, propose, and, if appropriate, service a contract with the City for [             the] products and services offered by one of the [principal companies] it represents, will come from that [principal company] if and only if, and after, the City procures those services through your firm.  If your firm’s efforts in this respect are unsuccessful,  and  no  City  procurement  occurs  through  your  firm,  then  your  firm  receives  no compensation for its work.  Accordingly, your firm’s compensation for what we have concluded are its lobbying efforts is not a present interest, but is completely conditioned upon a future uncertain event, namely the creation or award of a contract by the City to your firm (and/or [a principal company] through your firm), that is, upon the City’s approval of an administrative matter.  In the absence of any legislative intent to the contrary,3 we are compelled to conclude that, if the City does not issue an RFP, but elects to purchase [               ] services through your firm other than through  2 In § 2-156-220 (“Persons or Entities Not Required to Register”), these four types are, in summary: 1) the  news media; 2) City officials and employees appearing in their official capacities before City agencies; 3) persons who assist in drafting revisions to the City’s Municipal Code at the City’s request; and 4) certain persons who testify publicly before City Council or a Council Committee.   3 The Board attempted to ascertain whether the drafters of the June 2000 amendments to the Ordinance, which include the provisions at issue in this case, intended to exempt sales representatives, such as your firm, from either the definition of “lobbyist” or the registration requirements, or to exempt sales commissions from the prohibition on contingent lobbying fees.  Our inquiry failed to adduce any evidence of such an intent.  Case No. 01021.A August 24, 2001 Page 6  an  RFP,  and  your  firm  receives  its  compensation  in  the  manner  described  above,  then  that compensation indeed constitutes a prohibited contingent lobbying fee.  In that event both your firm and the [principal company] itself would be in violation of this section of the Ordinance.4   DETERMINATIONS:  After conducting considerable research, including an attempt to ascertain the intent of the drafters of the laws we are interpreting, the Board is compelled to determine that your firm is acting as a “lobbyist” (as defined in the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance) by virtue of its representatives’ contact with City employees or officials for the purpose of selling the City [                            services], and that, therefore, either the firm or its representatives individually are required  to  register  under  the  lobbyist  provisions  of  the  Ordinance.    Further,  the  Board  has determined that, if the City does not issue an RFP, but instead elects to purchase [such] services directly through your firm, and your firm receives its compensation in the form of a sales commission (i.e., it is paid by the [principal company        ]  if and only if the City determines to purchase that company’s products and services through your firm), that compensation constitutes a prohibited contingent lobbying fee, and both your firm and the principal company] itself would be in violation of the Ordinance.   Our determinations do not necessarily dispose of all issues relevant to this situation, but are based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify the Board immediately, as any change may alter our opinion.  Other rules or laws may also apply to this situation.  Should the facts presented change, you should contact the Board for further review of the matter.  RELIANCE:  This opinion may be relied upon by (1) any person involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered and (2) any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.    [signature]                   Darryl L. DePriest Chair  01021AO-redact.wpd  4  Because the City has not yet issued a relevant RFP, the Board need not at this time address whether all or any part of your firm’s compensation would be a prohibited contingent lobbying fee if the City does issue an RFP and your firm is the successful bidder.  The Ordinance’s definition of lobbyist states that “a person shall not be deemed to have undertaken to influence any legislative or administrative action solely by ... responding to a City request for proposals or qualifications.” (Emphasis added.)  Resolution of that issue would turn on whether your firm’s compensation stems “solely” from responding to this RFP.   "

A review of the evidence presented at the hearing will aid in understanding this   decision.          Thomas O’Donnell has been a building inspector for the City of Chicago for   about eighteen years and is currently a supervising building inspector.  He has been an   inspector in what was formerly known as the Institutions Public Place of Assembly and   Licensing Unit which conducted inspections of public places of assembly.  He conducted   food and liquor licensing inspections.  He has also been an inspector and supervisor in the   strategic task force which is concerned with properties that have criminal activity.           He is familiar with the Green Dolphin at 2200 N. Ashland Avenue which he   described as a large nightclub.  His most recent inspection was June 21, 2011, the date   before the hearing.  He had also done prior inspections at that location.  Those earlier   inspections revealed issues with egress throughout the building.  There was potential   danger in the event of an emergency there was not an adequate number of doors and the   exit doors were not the proper width.  There was not a proper or adequate means of   egress.  The building’s firewall separation exceeded the maximum allowable square   footage which meant sprinklers were needed or the business needed to be   compartmentalized with firewalls.  Inadequate firewall separation would not stop the   spread of fire and smoke.  These inspections also revealed that a number of alterations      2   had been made to the property which affected egress where the exits were located without   permits or plans.  There was a large single story masonry addition added to the northwest   corner of the building.  There was a small outdoor beer garden enclosed without a permit   and a large patio area that had plans and permits but was not built according to plans   submitted to the City.  The rough approximation of the size of these additions would be   25 x 75 for the masonry addition; 30 x 40 for the beer garden and 50 x 75 for the large   patio.  These additions without permits or not being done according to plans are   dangerous because they could affect egress because the previous egress was altered and   improper materials could be used that were not flame retardant.          O’Donnell met with the owner, the owner’s son, a new architect, and an electrical   contractor at the inspection that took place the day before the hearing.  They received a   new set of plans and a demolition permit to remove a wood-framed garage, a wood deck,   and some stairs on the river bank which they did.          Most of the violations O’Donnell was concerned with had been corrected.  A   number of those things were included on the new set of plans.  There had been some   small or minor interior improvements but the more serious things have not been   corrected.  The first inspection on the ongoing building court case was in May of 2010.    O’Donnell has never recommended to the judge to increase occupancy at this location   and the building department has not recommended increased occupancy.  He would like   to see the business obtain new occupancy cards based on an approved new set plans.  The   new plans he observed at the inspection had not been approved by buildings department.       3   Those plans needed to be approved by zoning review before the submittal process at the   Department of Buildings begins.  2200 North Ashland Avenue is not in full compliance   with the buildings department at this time.          O’Donnell testified he was working off an amended complaint at this inspection.    That complaint alleged 51 or 53 violations.  From his perspective only a couple of minor   smaller improvements and changes have been addressed.  The electrical and plumbing   counts on the complaint are not in his area.  O’Donnell did not know if 48 of the 51   violations had been completed.  Over the City’s objection, Respondent’s Exhibit 1, the   First Amended Complaint for Equitable and Other Relief, was allowed in evidence.          O’Donnell agreed that various allegations in the First Amended Complaint dealt   with specific areas in the Jazz Room, the Dolphin Room (that is the West and East   Room) that have been corrected since the initial complaint.  He also agreed additional   doors were installed that solved some of the egress problems but they were installed   without a permit.  O’Donnell referred to Count 36, subparagraph 3, which asked that the   licensee “rework east exit door at Webster Street entrance vestibule so it does not drag on   the sidewalk.”  That was not done as of the inspection the day before the hearing.    Paragraph 6, asking the licensee to remove a coiled overhead shutter in the west room   also had not been done at the time of this last inspection.  While O’Donnell admitted he   had never been at the premise at night, he opined this is a primary entrance point for the   licensee’s business.  He also opined this was a relatively simple item to correct.  As to the   coiled overhead shutter door, O’Donnell explained that work could not be done in      4   minutes but could be done during hours the business is not open.  The licensee would   need plans and permit for this work and this work is included on the new plans that will   be submitted.          O’Donnell testified that he believed Judge Pileggi, by court order, had closed the   area of the tent beer garden and the outside beer garden pending new plans and a new   permit being issued.  He further stated he has been at some of the status hearings on the   building court case but not all the status hearings.  He agreed there has been some   compliance but has not seen significant compliance with the items he identified as   potentially dangerous.  There has been some compliance with regards to egress but not   with respect to the firewall.  The permits needed to do the firewall work have not been   issued.  There is a count in the amended complaint with respect to the fact that the second   egree from the second floor office was removed when one of the additions was done.    This would raise the same concern with regard to people leaving the establishment.    O’Donnell never recommended that Judge Pileggi increase occupancy and he has   concerns about occupancy relating to the danger this building presented to the public.          Patrick Haran has been a plumbing inspector for the City of Chicago for nine   years.  He inspects plumbing systems to verify it is up to code, verify it has proper water   service, and verify it has the proper water heater.  With respect to commercial buildings   that need additional fixtures he ensures the fixtures are installed properly, that they be   handicap accessible and verify there are the proper amount of toilets and sinks.  He has   participated in inspections for the Green Dolphin bar at 2200 N. Ashland Avenue, the last      5   inspection being performed the date before the hearing.  He inspected as early as May of   2010.  He found several violations such as inadequate amount of toilet sinks, hand sinks   and mop sink.  There were additional fixtures that had been installed without a permit.    There were no handicap facilities and an inadequate number of lavatories with improper   water service.  There was also a problem with the mop sink which was potentially   dangerous and hazardous.          The inspection the day before the hearing revealed that a plumbing permit was   pulled earlier this year.  Some of the violations had been addressed, but the main   violations concerning adding sufficient plumbing fixtures, upgrading the water service   and adding handicapped accessibility to the bathroom remained.  With the permit the   licensee did install hand sinks behind the bar but they were installed improperly.  The   drain was tied into the downspout underneath the floor when it should have been   connected to the sewer.  This could cause the release of sewer gas in the room after it   rains.  The bathrooms have not come into compliance and he discussed with the architect   at the inspection the number of fixtures that would be needed.  At present the corrected   violations would be service work, not major corrections and the plumbing counts left   open are more important than what has been done.          Haran acknowledged being present for some of the status conferences in building   court but could not recall a status on May 30, 2011, and did not recall Judge Hughes    asking if he had concerns about dangerous conditions on the premises.  He added there is   nothing dangerous now but added if the traps are sucked out of the sink it could cause      6   sewer gas which would be a dangerous condition.  That is in the tainted area and the main   bar area.              Over the City’s objections Respondent’s Group Exhibit 2, consisting of orders   from the building court case entered on November 16, 22 and December 10 were allowed   in evidence.          Ron Gardner has been an architect since 1976 and was Deputy Commissioner of   the Department of Buildings for six years under Mayor Harold Washington and Eugene   Sawyer.  He is now President of Group Design Associates, Incorporated, which consists   of architects, engineers, planners and construction managers.  He has been working with   Green Dolphin, Incorporated, since the summer of 2010.  He has been present at a few of   the inspections and is working through zoning, as well as, the building department to   ensure the proper permits are issued.  They are presently working for approval from   zoning and landscape.  Revised plans were submitted to zoning and they are in the   process of working on correction with landscape review.  He hoped that landscape review   would be approved as early as the next week, and then they could address the zoning   issue.  Based on his experience it could be a couple of months before permits would   issue.          Mr. Gardner was present for the testimony of Mr. O’Donnell and the plumbing   inspection.  He agrees there are code violations but does not agree that they are dangerous   or hazardous to the public.       7      Article 4 of the State of Illinois Liquor Control Act is entitled “Local Control”   and it enumerates the powers given to a city, village, incorporated town, and a county    board with respect to control of alcohol and it also designates who is the local liquor   control commissioner of each such government body for the purpose of administering   this rule.  235 ILCS 5/4-1 does indicate that issuance of licenses shall not be prohibited   except for the reasons listed in Section 6-2, 6-11, 6-12, and 6-25 of the Liquor Control   Act.          235 ILCS 5/7-9 of the Liquor Control Act gives jurisdiction to this Commission   of cases involving the granting or refusing to grant a license and that matter is tried de   novo by this Commission.          Counsel for the licensee has made a legal argument that states in essence that   Section 6-1 of the Act dealing with refusal to renew deals only with the State of Illinois   liquor license.  The argument is that this section does not empower a local liquor control   commissioner to refuse to renew based on suitability of the premises.  This seems in   essence to an argument on the jurisdiction of this Commission.  If the local does not have   the authority to refuse to renew a license for suitability grounds, then how does this   Commission have jurisdiction.  That argument is not reflected on the appeal filed by the   licensee.  In fact it was the licensee’s appeal that brought this case before this   Commission.  If the licensee felt there was no jurisdiction before this Commission it   could have gone directly to the Circuit Court.  Since jurisdiction may be raised at any      9   time and particularly since jurisdiction of this Commission is set up by State Statute it is   necessary to address whether this matter is properly before this Commission.          235 ILCS 5/7-9 allows for the appeal of any order or action of a local liquor   control commissioner “granting or refusing to grant a license or revoking or suspending a   license.”  This language delineates granting or refusing to grant a license from revoking   or suspending a license.  The action in this case is entitled Refusal to Renew which would   be encompassed in the clause refusing to grant a license.  This section goes on to give this   jurisdiction to determine the propriety of this refusal de novo.          Case law from state and federal court support the position that this Commission   would have jurisdiction.  The case of City of Wyoming vs. Local Liquor Control   Commission of Illinois, dealt with the refusal of the Mayor of the City of Wyoming as   the local liquor control commissioner to renew the local liquor license of Wyoming Super   Value, Inc.  This decision was appealed to the State of Illinois Liquor Control   Commission which reversed the failure to renew.  The Appellate Court commented that   “while the state statute did not expressly require compliance with procedural   requirements when a local liquor control commissioner refuses to renew it could not have   been the legislative intent that a local liquor control commissioner be able to easily avoid   the application of the statutory procedural requirements to license revocation by waiting   for the license to expire and then refuse to issue a renewal license.”  For that reason the   court interpreted the term “revocation” to include the refusal to issue a renewal license.          10

After careful consideration of the facts and the relevant law, the Board finds that the Ordinance does not prohibit you from approaching [the Commissioner], although it does place certain restrictions on your future conduct while a City employee.  This advisory opinion reviews the facts you presented and sets forth the Board’s analysis and conclusions.   FACTS:  You  have  been  the  [  regional  administrator  ]  of  the  [  ...  ] Neighborhood Health Center  within the Chicago Department of Public Health for approximately the past 18 months.  As an administrator you oversee the core staff at the [ neighborhood ] clinic, as well as the various operations of the clinic, such as its ambulatory care facility.    Before being employed by the City, you were on [    a   state   ] Governor’s Task Force on Medical Communications Technology and were also a fellow at the American College of Health Care Executives.  Both of these experiences were instrumental in the development of     [                 Alpha                         ], a  set  of  data  elements  that  you  hope  will  one  day  constitute  the  essential structure in a healthcare management information system.  You said that in April  1998,  you  received  a  patent  for  [      Alpha          ]  and  also  received  a copyright for the research on which it is based   [                  ...                    ].  The current healthcare management information system used by the City is called  Global  System.    Although  you  are  uncertain  about  the  details,  you believe that the City acquired it under a contract that is about to expire.  As with  most  health  care  management  information  systems,  Global  System provides some information about healthcare providers (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes), payers (e.g. Blue Cross), suppliers (e.g. pharmaceutical companies) and consumers.  With this system, the relevant employees of the City can find out how many patients are seen by a particular hospital, which doctors saw them, and so forth. You stated that you use the system for basic information searches and receive  reports  that are generated  by the system at the central  Re: Case No. 00011.A September 13, 2000 Page 2  office.  You said that you did not have a hand in training individuals to use Global, and that you did not have any input in the City’s decision to use it.     In your opinion, Global System is inadequate on at least two levels.  First, its software does not carry out many of the tasks for which it is designed.  You attribute this first failure to poor linkage of databases and unsuitable algorithms, which direct the system in obtaining and organizing data.  The second inadequacy of Global System, in your opinion, is that it does not include enough data or categorize that data effectively.    You believe that [Alpha], with what you characterize as its well-considered and near-exhaustive set of  data  elements  (5,750  of  them),  could  either  complement  or  replace  Global  System.    More specifically, you said that the set of data elements will address the second inadequacy in Global System — that it does not include enough data and does not categorize the data effectively.  You stated that the repository capabilities of [Alpha], which enable it to collect and store data, and its ability to organize this data could be very valuable to the City’s Department of Public Health, as well as to suppliers, consumers, payers, and so forth.  You claimed that it would enable one to track, benchmark and compare, among other things, demographic information about patients, the number of employees per square footage at hospitals, the kind of tests ordered by doctors, practice patterns of different doctors and institutions, the reasons for and numbers of complaints and grievances at a particular hospital, which tests providers have ordered, and so forth.  Before  [Alpha]  could  be  put  into  practice,  however,  you  estimate  that  [Alpha]  would  require approximately six months of development work, devoted to designing a database platform.  You do not anticipate the City would be involved with this development.  You stated that you believe that this development work would need to be performed by a company such as Oracle Corporation. You estimated these development costs at around 8 to 9 million dollars, and you expect that you would need to enlist the support of venture capital in order to fund the development.  You said that you would expect to be paid for your ideas and labor by these venture capitalists. You stated that, at this point in time, you have not yet approached any companies such as Oracle or any venture capitalists.     You said that you would like to approach the Commissioner of the Department of Public Health  [      ...      ] to ""see if [s/he] might be interested"" in using [Alpha] once it is developed.  You indicated that any endorsement or expression of interest by [the Commissioner] could then be parleyed by you to venture capitalists, as positive evidence of the potential of [Alpha].  Once [Alpha] is developed, you envision offering a 5 or 10 year license to the City for the use of [Alpha], free of charge.  LAW & ANALYSIS  1.  Section 2-156-090(a)     The first section of the Ordinance that applies to your situation is 2-156-090(a), ""Representation of Other Persons,"" which provides, in relevant part:  Re: Case No. 00011.A September 13, 2000 Page 3  No...  employee  may  represent...  any  person  other  than  the  City  in  any  formal  or informal proceeding or transaction before any City agency in which the agency’s action or non-action is of a nonministerial nature; provided that nothing in this subsection shall preclude any employee from performing the duties of his employment....  This provision prohibits City employees from representing persons other than the City in certain situations.  In the past, the Board has interpreted such representation as applying to a broad range of activities in which one person acts as a spokesperson for someone other than the City, and seeks to communicate or promote the interests of that party.     In prior Board cases decided under §2-156-090 of the Ordinance, there has always been an explicitly identified third party — such as a corporation —  in addition to the City and the individual employee. See Case No. 89126.A  The instant case marks the first time the Board has addressed the question of whether a person, speaking on his or her own behalf (as you would be if you approached [the Commissioner    ]), should be understood to be ""representing a person other than the City,” within the meaning of  §2-156-090.    Nevertheless,  in  past  post-employment  cases,  decided  under  §2-156-100  of  the  Ordinance1,  the Board has addressed a similar question regarding representation.  In both Case Nos. 93018.A and 99010.A, the Board determined that the Ordinance does not prohibit consulting agreements between the City and its former employees provided, among other conditions, the former employee does not represent the interests of any other entity in connection with his or her responsibilities to the City.  In its reasoning in Case No.  99010.A, the Board made the following observation:   If you were to consult with the City in your capacity  as  an employee of your own  professional services  corporation,  however,  you  would  be  assisting  or  representing  a  third  party  —  the corporation — and, as such,  would be confronted with a situation in which you would owe loyalties to both the City and to your corporation — a situation the Board viewed in Case No. 93018.A as the major harm contemplated by the post-employment provisions.  The fact that you would be the sole owner,  shareholder,  officer,  and  employee  of  the  corporation  does  not  change  the  Board’s conclusion.  A corporation is a separate entity.  If your corporation were to enter into a consulting agreement under which you would personally  provide services to your former Department, you would owe a fiduciary duty to the corporation.  Id. at 4.   1In relevant part, the provision states: No former official or employee shall, for a period of one year after the termination of the official's or employee's term of office or employment, assist or represent any person in any business transaction involving the City or any of its agencies, if the official or employee participated personally and substantially in the subject matter of the transaction during his term of office or employment.  Re: Case No. 00011.A September 13, 2000 Page 4  In the instant case, the Board concludes that a similar distinction is appropriate; that is, as long as you are acting merely as an individual when you approach [the Commissioner], and not as part of a larger business enterprise, whether a corporation, a partnership or some other kind of organization, you are not “representing a person other than the City,” in the sense that is prohibited by Section  2-156-090.  It is important to emphasize, however, that if your situation should change — if, for example, you incorporate or enter into some kind of agreement with a database platform developer, a venture capitalist, and so forth — you should re-contact the Board with the relevant details, so that we may advise you on how the Ordinance applies to your new situation.  2.  Section 2-156-080(a) A  second  Ordinance  provision  relevant  to  your  situation  is  Section  2-156-080(a),  ""Conflicts  of Interest; Appearance of Impropriety.""  It states, in pertinent part:  No ... employee shall make or participate in the making of any governmental decision with respect to any matter in which he has any economic interest distinguishable from that of the general public.  The Ordinance defines an ""economic interest"" in §2-156-010(i) as ""any interest valued or capable of valuation in monetary terms....""  At this point, [Alpha] is an idea in need of development, not a finished product that someone could purchase and then put into immediate use.  Nonetheless, since you  expect  to  profit  from  [Alpha]  when  you  enter  into  an  agreement  with  a  database  platform developer and a venture capitalist, it is reasonable to conclude that [Alpha] is capable of valuation in monetary terms, even in its present underdeveloped state, and that you have an economic interest in [Alpha] that is distinct from the interests of the general public.  The  conflict  of  interest  provision  prohibits  City  employees  from  participating  in  or  making governmental decisions or actions in which they have an ""economic interest"" (as defined) that is distinguishable from that of the public.  When fully developed, [Alpha], you suggest, could replace Global Systems, the healthcare management information system that the City presently uses. Since you have an economic interest in [Alpha], it follows that governmental decisions involving  [Alpha] as  an  alternative  or  supplemental  healthcare  management  information  system  may  affect  your economic interest.  Therefore, in your City employment you are prohibited from participating in governmental decisions about [Alpha].  Furthermore, given that your participation in any decision about keeping, replacing or supplementing the Department’s healthcare management information system,  whether  or  not  these  decisions  make  explicit  reference  to  [Alpha],  may  present  the appearance of impropriety, we strongly recommend that you recuse yourself from these decisions as well.  3.  Section 2-156-110 A  third  Ordinance  provision  that  might  apply  to  your  situation  is  §2-156-110,  ""Interest  in  City Business,"" which states, in relevant part:  Re: Case No. 00011.A September 13, 2000 Page 5  No ... employee shall have a financial interest in his own name or in the name of any other person in any contract, work or business of the City, or in the sale of any article, whenever the expense, price or consideration of the contract, work, business or sale is paid with funds belonging to or administered by the City, or is authorized by  ordinance...  At present, a contract or other agreement with the City involving the use or sale of [Alpha] appears rather remote.  Should such a possibility materialize in the future, however, we advise you to contact the Board for specific advice on how the Ordinance would apply.  Conceivably, if your interest in such an agreement were to give you a ""financial interest"" in City business, you might be obligated to resign your position with the City in order to proceed with the agreement.  DETERMINATION: The Board determines that the Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit you from approaching  [            the  Commissioner            ]  of  the  Department  of  Public  Health  to  solicit  the Department’s  interest  in  your  [              Alpha  data  elements  set          ].    However,  once  you  have approached [ the Commissioner ], you are prohibited from participating in governmental decisions about [Alpha], and furthermore, we recommend that you recuse yourself from all discussions about keeping, replacing, or supplementing the Department’s healthcare management information systems, whether or not these decisions make explicit reference to [Alpha], in order to prevent the appearance of impropriety.  Finally, if a contract or other agreement with the City involving the use or sale of [Alpha] should materialize in the future, we advise you to contact the Board for specific advice on how the Ordinance applies.  The Board’s opinion is not necessarily dispositive of all issues relevant to this situation, but is based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify us immediately, as any change may alter our opinion.  Other laws or rules also may apply to this situation.  Be advised that City departments have the authority to adopt and enforce rules of conduct that may be more restrictive than the limitations imposed by the Ethics Ordinance.  We appreciate your inquiry and your  concern to abide  by the standards embodied in the Ethics Ordinance.    We  enclose  a  copy  of  the  Ordinance  for  your  reference.    If  you  have  any  further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.  RELIANCE: This opinion may be relied upon by (1) any person involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered and (2) any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.

In early October, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install a  new  sewer  in  North  Spaulding  Avenue  from  North  Elston  Avenue  to  200’  N  of  West  Waveland Avenue. The old sewer needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons.  Outside of  working hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.  You will always be able  to reach your home or business.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We  know  that  construction  always  involves  inconveniences  and  noise.  We  will  do  everything  possible  to  maintain  your  quality  of  life  throughout  these  projects,  and  conducting  ourselves  as  good  and  thoughtful  neighbors  in  the  course  of  our  presence  on  your street.     Should  you  have  any  questions  or  concerns,  you  can  either ask  the  construction  foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    33rd Ward Office:  773-478-8040    35th Ward Office:  773-887-3772    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.

I want to be certain  you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you  have any questions or concerns.    Our crews will soon be installing 2,122 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Albany  Ave. (W. Diversey Ave. to N. Avondale Ave.), W. Wellington Ave. (N. Troy St.  to N. Whipple St.) and W. George St. (N. Albany Ave. to N. Whipple St.). The old  main dates back to 1891 and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Colon’s office, and he has made clear we are  to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project.  Good communications is the  key.    I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely.  We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.    If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.      Thank you for your understanding and good will.      Sincerely    Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner      cc:   Alderman Rey Colon     35th Ward                                                Do you wonder what was happening in 1891?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                              Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap   and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.               PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 2,122 feet of 8-inch water main in  N. Albany Ave. (W. Diversey Ave. to N. Avondale Ave.), W. Wellington Ave. (N. Troy St. to  N. Whipple St.) and W. George St. (N. Albany Ave. to N. Whipple St.).    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1891 and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Water main installation is anticipated to begin early April, with completion of this  project projected for late July. Completion of this project includes restoration. This, of course, is  an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected developments in the street, or other circumstances  (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Albany Ave., W. Wellington Ave. and W. George  St. without interruption, but we will have to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1   ALDERMAN REY COLON   773-365-3535   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                     FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July. This  includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of  other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

Protect yourself and your family by following these steps:    Inside the Home  •  Keep children and pets out of the affected area until cleanup has been completed.  •  Wear rubber boots, rubber gloves, and goggles during cleanup of affected area.  •  Remove and discard items that cannot be washed and disinfected (such as, mattresses, carpeting,   carpet padding, rugs, upholstered furniture, cosmetics, stuffed animals, baby toys, pillows, foam- rubber items, books, wall coverings, and most paper products).   •  Remove and discard drywall and insulation that has been contaminated with sewage or flood waters.   •  Thoroughly clean all hard surfaces (such as flooring, concrete, molding, wood and metal furniture,   countertops, appliances, sinks, and other plumbing fixtures) with hot water and laundry or dish  detergent.   •  Help the drying process by using fans, air conditioning units, and dehumidifiers.  •  After completing the cleanup, wash your hands with soap and water. Use water that has been boiled   for 1 minute (allow the water to cool before washing your hands).    o  Or you may use water that has been disinfected for personal hygiene use (solution of ⅛   teaspoon [~0.75 milliliters] of household bleach per 1 gallon of water). Let it stand for 30  minutes. If the water is cloudy, use solution of ¼ teaspoon (~1.5 milliliters) of household  bleach per 1 gallon of water.    •  Wash all clothes worn during the cleanup in hot water and detergent. These clothes should be washed   separately from uncontaminated clothes and linens.   •  Wash clothes contaminated with flood or sewage water in hot water and detergent.

By mid June 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 400 feet of new 8-inch and 771 feet of new 12-inch  water main in N. Ada Street, from W. Hubbard Street to W. Kinzie Street, N. Ada Street, from   N. Ogden Avenue to W. Carroll Avenue and N. Ada Street, from W. Fulton Street to W. Lake Street.  The old water main dates back to 1883, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  27th Ward Office: 312-432-1995  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

The ordinance goes into effect July 1, 2017. The ordinance applies to employers that maintain a business  facility within the City of Chicago and/or are required to obtain a business license to operate in the City.  Employees of an employer that is subject to the Ordinance who work at least 80 hours within any 120-day  period qualify. This includes domestic employees, day laborers, tipped workers, and home health care workers.  How is Paid Sick Leave Calculated?  • Paid sick leave begins to accrue either on the 1st calendar day after the start of employment or on July 1,   2017, whichever is later.  • For every 40 hours worked, an employee earns one hour of paid sick leave in full hour increments. • Salaried employees who are exempt from overtime requirements shall accrue one hour of Paid Sick Leave   for each week of employment.    • Paid sick leave hours are capped at 40 hours per 12-month period unless the employer sets a higher limit. • At the end of a 12-month accrual period, employees must be allowed to carry over up to half of unused   paid sick leave (a maximum of 20 hours) unless the employer sets a higher limit.  • If subject to Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), each employee must be allowed to carry over up to  40 hours of unused paid sick leave, in addition to half of all unused paid sick time, to use exclusively for  FMLA-eligible purposes.  What are Employee Rights Under the Ordinance?  Employees may use paid sick leave when: • They are ill or injured, or to receive medical care, treatment, diagnosis or preventative medical care; • A family member is ill or injured, or to care for a family member receiving medical care, treatment,   diagnosis or preventative medical care;  • They or a family member are victims of domestic violence or sex offense; or • Their place of business is closed by order of a public official due to public health emergency, or they have   a child who needs care because their school or place or care is closed due to a public health emergency. • Employees who believe they have not received paid sick leave may call 311 to report a violation of the   Ordinance to the City of Chicago.  • A complaint affidavit must be fully completed and returned to BACP to initiate an investigation. • Employees are not required to provide, and the City will not request, information regarding the   immigration status of any person filing a complaint.  • BACP does not act as the employee’s private attorney. Any employee has the right to file a private civil   action against the employer in circuit court if the employer violated the provisions of the Ordinance.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 551 feet of 8-inch water main in E. 114th Street, from S.  Cottage Grove Avenue to the Alley East of S. Langley Avenue. The old pipe dates back to1890,  and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Beale’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                                                                                114TH STREET WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 551 feet of 8-inch water  main in E. 114th Street, from S. Cottage Grove Avenue to the Alley East of S. Langley Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by mid July 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on E. 114th Street outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                  CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN ANTHONY BEALE    773-785-1100                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid July 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!
