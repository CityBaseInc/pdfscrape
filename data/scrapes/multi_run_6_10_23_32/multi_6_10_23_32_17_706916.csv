Spatz, Jr.  Coinmissioner   At Alderman Smith's request, I am providing you with material related to a project  coming to your neighborhood.  I want to be certain you are we11 informed, and that  you know where to call if there are any questions or concerns.   Our crews are installing 1,623 feet of 8-inch water main in W.  Early Avenue (N.  Glenwood Avenue to N. Broadway).   I have asked my staff to assemble this material for you, and also to stay in close  touch with the project.  We know that construction always has some  inconveniences and noise associated with it, but we want to do everything we can  to minimize the inconvenience and conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful  neighbors during our time in your street.   Please feel free to call Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at (3 12) 742-1 029, at  any time.  In the meantime, thank you in advance for your understanding and good  will.   Sincerely   John F. Spatz, Jr.  Commissioner   City of Chicago  Richard M. Daley   Mayor   Depament of Water Managemnet   John F. Spatz, Jr.  Coinmissioner   Do you wonder what was happening in 1890? That's the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:   CY YOUNG IN ACTION   The first U.S.  college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.  W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.  Idaho and Wyoming became states.  Congress created the Weather Bureau.  Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.  X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.  Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.  The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.  Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.   City ofChicago  ~ichard M.  ~ a i e ~    Mayor   Deparhnent of Water Managemnet   John F. Spatz, Jr.  Co~nmissioner   PROJECT DESCRIPTION   Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,623 feet of 8-inch water main in  W. Early Avenue (N. Glenwood Avenue to N.  Broadway).   Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and we can expect increasingly fiequent breaks if we don't  replace it.   Timing: Water main installation is anticipated to begin in early March 201 0 with completion of  this project projected for beginning of June 2010. Completion of this project includes  restoration. This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected developments in the  street, or other circumstances (e.g.  weather) that force us to adjust our schedules.   Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Early Avenue without interruption, but we will  have to restrict parking around our work zone.   Parking: We will post our work area for ""No Parking"" as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.   Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1   ALDERMAN MARY ANN SMITH   773-784-5277   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029   City ofCi~ica~o  Riclmd M. Daley   Mayor   Department of water Managemnet   John F. Spatz, Jr.  Commissioner   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS   What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 3 12-742-1 029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it's  off hours.   Can I park when you're  not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.   Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude the middle of May  20 10. Restoration will follow in early June 20 10. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.   Will you shut my water O W  Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.   Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.   "

MARTIN, PRESIDENT,   from the order of a five-day Suspension of the Mayor, as Local Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago,    entered and taken JUNE 4, 2007 and the Commission having reviewed the said appeal and the transcript of proceedings   taken before the Mayor, as Local Liquor Control Commissioner, and the parties having made oral argument and the    Commission now fully advised in the premises DOTH FIND:   A) 	  B) 	  That the Mayor, as Local Liquor Control Commissioner has proceeded in the manner   provided by law.   That the finding of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner that the licensee failed to maintain   liquor license liability (dram shop) insurance for the licensed premises from November 18, 2005   through December 15, 2005, is not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.    This Commission further finds as a matter of law that the City failed to prove that the licensee failed   to maintain liquor liability (dram shop) insurance for the licensed premises from November 18, 2005  through December 18, 2005, in violation of the Municipal Code, Title 4, Chapter 60, 040 (c) (2).    It should also be noted that the provision of the Municipal Code alleged to have been violated by the  licensee and found to have been violated by the licensee by the Hearing Officer is Title 4, Chapter 60,  Section 040 (c) (1).  That section of the Municipal Code does not address the issue of liability (dram  shop) insurance.   C) 	  That the order of a five-day suspension is not supported by the findings of the Local Liquor Control   1    Commission.     IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND ADJUDGED That the order suspending the liquor license of the appellant    for FIVE (5) Days is REVERSED.   Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a Petition for Rehearing may be filed with this Commission  within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order is deemed to be the date of  service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the Circuit Court the Petition for Rehearing must  be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order as such petition is a jurisdictional  prerequisite to the administrative review.

By late November 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,262 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Essex  Avenue, from E. 91st Street to E. 93rd Street. The old water main dates back to 1893 and needs to be  replaced. We expect the water main work to be completed by mid January 2018. Restoration will  follow in mid April 2018. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  7th Ward Office: 773-731-7777  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016
