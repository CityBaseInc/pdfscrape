Sedgwick, 3rd Floor, Chicago, IL 60654    312/744-4111 (Voice), 312/744-1081 (Fax), 312/744-1088 (TDD)    IN THE MATTER OF:   Ellyn VanDyck  Complainant,  v.   Old Time Tap  Respondent.   Case No.:  04-E-1 03   Date of Ruling: April  15, 2009   I.   INTRODUCTION   FINAL RULING   Complainant Ellyn VanDyck filed a Complaint on June 10, 2004, alleging that she suffered  discrimination in violation of the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance based on perceived disability  when she was fired from her job as a fill-in bartender at Respondent, Old Time Tap, located at 13501  S.  Brandon A venue in Chicago.  Old Time Tap maintains that after Ms. VanDyck missed work due  to a medical condition unrelated to her job, she failed to retum to work; then the bartender for whom  she was filling in returned to work, so Ms.  VanDyck was no longer needed.  Old Time Tap denies  that it had knowledge of her medical condition or that her medical condition had anything to do with  its decision to replace her.   The  Commission  on  Human  Relations  found  substantial  evidence  of a  violation  of the  Chicago Human Rights Ordinance and advanced the case to the administrative hearing process.  Ms.  Van  Dyck  represented  herself  pro  se  at  the  administrative  hearing,  and  Old  Time  Tap  was  represented  by counsel.  The  hearing  was  conducted on  September  10,  2008,  and  post -hearing  briefing was completed on December 22, 2008.   II.   FACTUAL FINDINGS   A.   1.   The Facts   Complainant,  Ellyn  Van  Dyck,  was hired by Old Time Tap  as  a  fill-in  bartender   sometime in  2003.  (Tr.  13.)   2.   3.   Old Time Tap is  owned and operated by Don and Christine Jones.  (Tr. 93, 127 .)   The job opening that Van Dyck filled  arose when bartender Geri Polozet chose to   reduce her shifts to one day a week because of her pregnancy.  (Tr. 94-96.)   4.   VanDyck's  original  shifts  were  Wednesday  and  Sunday  nights,  but  as  business  slowed, she was  cut back to just Sundays.  (Tr.  12.)  Respondent's Exhibit (""RX"")  I,  which was  received into evidence. reflects some if not all of the hours VanDyck worked at Old Time Tap.   5.   The last day VanDyck worked at Old Time Tap was Sunday, December 7, 2003.  (Tr.  16.)  A  few  days  later,  on  December  10,  for  reasons  that had  nothing to  do  with  her  work,  she  became dizzy, fell, hit her head, and had to go to the hospital.  (Tr.  16, 17.)   6.   The  parties  agree  that  Old  Time  Tap  bears  no  responsibility  for  her  injury  or   hospitalization.  (Tr. 75.)   7.   She remained in the hospital for four days and remembers little about that experience.  (Tr.  17.)  In fact, VanDyck had been suffering dizzy spells since 2002, a condition for which she had  been taking medication.  (Tr.  19-20.)   8.   Although she never shared her medical information with Old Time Tap, she had also   suffered a mild stroke in 2002.  (Tr.  19-20, 41.)   9.   Don Jones had no knowledge ofVan Dyck' s medical conditions, and he never noticed   any medical condition affecting Van Dyck's work in any way.  (Tr. 41, 109-110.)   10.   On one occasion, Don Jones saw VanDyck taking some pills, and he asked her about   them, but only to ensure that she was not using illegal drugs.  (Tr.  115.)   11.   VanDyck was scheduled to work the evening of December 14, 2003.  She had been  released from the hospital earlier that day and initially thought she was well enough to go to work.  But as the day went on she started feeling ill, and so she called to say she couldn't come in because,  she said, she had had a dizzy spell, fell,  and hit her head.  (Tr.  23, 25, 64.)  Although she believes  she  spoke  directly  with  Don Jones,  he  denies  speaking  with  her;  he  believes  he  learned  of her  absence from the bartender who was on duty earlier that day.  (Tr.  23, 50, 103-104.)   12.   In any event, VanDyck did not work the night of December 14, and someone else   covered her shift.  (Tr. 25,  103-104.)   13.   VanDyck recalls phoning or visiting the Old Time Tap on several other occasions  after December 14.  She left messages for Don Jones but got no response.  (Tr. 25-26, 43, 44.)  She  admits, however, that her recollection of how many times she went to the Tap to speak with Don  Jones is  not good.  (Tr. 43-44.)  She believes that on December 16, she spoke with  Don Jones and  he told her he did not  want her to  return because she  was  ""a risk and a liability.""  (Tr.  27.)  She  recalls calling him again and leaving messages,  but she never received a return call.  (Tr.  26-27.)  Don Jones denies this, however, and further denies having had any phone conversations with Van  Dyck after her last day of work, December 7, 2003.  (Tr.  104-105,  118-119.)   14.   According to Don Jones, because he never heard from VanDyck after December 14,  he  thought she had  simply failed  to  show  up  on  Sunday,  December 21,  2003,  and  he  asked  the  Tuesday night bartender, Eddie Brummel, to fill  in for her.  (Tr.  104-105.)   15.   The only telephone at the Old Time Tap is  a pay phone, which both customers and  management use.  (Tr. 60.)  When VanDyck was on duty, she answered the phone nine times out   2    of ten, and it is  likely that other bartenders answered the phone when they were on duty.  (Tr. 60.)  There is  no answering machine on this phone.  (Tr.  117.)   16.   By chance, VanDyck and Don Jones ran into each other at a local hardware store in  January 2004.  (Tr. 27,  107,  113.)  When VanDyck asked Jones, ""What's up  with work?"" he told  her they had replaced her.  (Tr.  27, 108.)   17.   Eddie Brummel, who had more seniority than VanDyck, took the Sunday evening   shift during the month ofJanuary.  (Tr.  119-120.)   18.   The  bartender  whom  Van  Dyck  had  replaced,  Geri  Polozet,  returned  from  her   maternity leave on Wednesday, February 4, 2004.  (Tr.  109.)   19.   VanDyck was paid $50 per night, and as noted above, at the time of her injury, she   was working only one night per week.  (Tr.  20, 34.)   20.   VanDyck was out of work for approximately ten months until November  l, 2004,   when she took a job as a cashier in Hammond, Indiana.  (Tr.  68.)   21.   She estimates her lost income for this ten-month period amounts to $2,000 in lost  wages, plus tips, which she estimates would have totaled $2,100.  (Tr. 68-76.)  She admits, however,  that she never kept track of tips and the amount may have been significantly lower.  (Tr. 71-72.)   22.   Because ofPolozet's return to work, VanDyck's job as a fill-in bartender would have   ended February  l, 2004, in any event.   23.   Although VanDyck offered medical records showing substantial medical bills related  to her December 10, 2003, fall, e.g. Complainant's Exhibits A and B, there was no contention that  Old Time Tap was responsible for that injury.  Only the last page of Exhibit A was  received into  evidence.  (Tr. 92.)   B.   Credibility   24.   The hearing officer found Ms. VanDyck very credible and very precise.  In addition  to her own testimony, VanDyck called her boyfriend, Wayde Bleege, to testify.  Mr. Bleege was also  found  very credible; however, he had little if anything to say that was relevant to Ms.  VanDyck's  claim.   25.   Respondent's witnesses were Don and Christine Jones, the owners of Old Time Tap.   They were also found credible.   26.   The hearing officer noted that during the course of the hearing, each of the witnesses   for both sides appeared to make every effort to testify honestly.   3   III.   CONCLUSIONS OF LAW   This case arises under Section 2-160-030 of the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance, which  provides:  ""No person shall directly or indirectly discriminate against any individual  in hiring ...  discharge  .  .  .  or  any  other  term  or  condition  of employment  because  of the  individual's  .  .  .  disability.""  It  is  Complainant's  burden to  prove,  by a  preponderance of the  evidence,  that  her  disability motivated the Respondent to discharge her.  See, e.g., Luckett v.  Chicago Dept. ofAviation,  CCHR No. 97-E-115 (Oct. 18, 2000).  A disability is defined under the Regulations implementing  the Human Rights Ordinance as ""a determinable physical or mental characteristic which may result  from  disease,  injury,  congenital  condition of birth,  or functional  disorder.""  Part  100(11).  The  definition also includes ""the perception of such a characteristic.""  Id.  The Commission has held that  to be actionable, the medical condition must not be insubstantial or transitory.  See, e.g., Jacobs v.  White Cap,  Inc., CCHR No. 96-E-238/239 (July 29, 1997).  Complainant's initial burden is to prove  that:   She is  a member of the  protected class (a person with a disability or perceived as  such);   She was performing her job to her employer's legitimate expectations;   She suffered an adverse employment action; and   Similarly situated employees did not suffer the same adverse employment action.   Wehbe v.  Contacts & Specs, CCHR No. 93-E-232 (Nov. 20, 1996); see also McDonnell-Douglas v.  Green, 411  U.S. 792 (1973). 1  Respondent contests each of these elements.   Turning to the first element, Complainant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence  that  she  was  a  person  with  a  disability  or  that  she  was  perceived  as  such.  The  only  detail  Complainant provided about her disability is that it was ""related to [her] head injury.""  Complaint,  '1[11.  This vague  and non-specific  allegation falls  short of the ""determinable physical  or mental  characteristic"" required by the Regulation.  At the hearing, Complainant testified that she told her  employer she had gotten dizzy, which adds some specificity.  But her dizziness was only a transitory  condition,  which the Commission has  held  insufficient to satisfy the Ordinance.  Jacobs,  supra.  Furthermore,  the  evidence  was  overwhelming  that  Old  Time  Tap  was  never  aware  of  any  ""determinable"" medical condition that would meet the definition.  There is  no evidence that any  agent of Old Time Tap learned anything about VanDyck's December 10 injury other than that she  had  become  dizzy  and  hurt  her  head.  There  is  simply  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  Don  Jones  perceived VanDyck as someone with a determinable non-temporary medical characteristic of any   Under the McDonnell·Douglas method of proof, if a complainant establishes a prima facie case of   discrimination, the respondent then has the  burden of articulating a non·discriminatory basis for  its actions.  The  burden then shifts back to complainant to  prove that the basis offered by the respondent is pretextual.  See, e.g.,  Prewitt v.  John  0. Butler Co., CCHR No.  97.£-42 (Dec. 6, 2000); Adams v.  Chicago Fire Department, CCHR No.  92-E-72 (Sept. 20,  1995).   4   •    sort.  Complainant has  not  proved  the  first  element of her prima facie  case,  and  therefore  her  complaint must be dismissed.   If we were to address the remaining elements of the prima facie case, Complainant would  prevail  on  the  second  but  lose  on  the  third  and  fourth.  Although  Respondent  presented  some  testimony suggesting that VanDyck was not always  sufficiently attentive to the customers of Old  Time Tap, the hearing officer found that she was performing her job to her employer's reasonable  expectations.  Thus, she met her burden on the second element of proof of her prima facie case.   As  for the  third element,  it  is  highly disputed  whether Complainant suffered  an  adverse  employment action when she was replaced.  She testified that she attempted to advise her employer  that she was  ready to  return to  work on December 21,  but Don Jones recalled receiving no such  message.  As noted above, both witnesses were very credible.  The hearing officer was unable to give  the testimony of one witness more weight than the other.  While the hearing officer had the distinct  impression  that  Van  Dyck  sincerely  believed  she  spoke  directly  with  Don  Jones  on or  before  December 21, and that he told her she was a ""risk and a liability,""  Don Jones was found equally  credible in denying any such conversation.  In fact, he denied making any decision to replace Van  Dyck and explained that her position was filled first by another bartender with more seniority and  then by the  bartender who returned from  maternity leave.  Because the evidence on this  point is  evenly matched,  the  Complainant has  failed  to establish this  element by a preponderance of the  evidence, as  required for her to prevail.   With regard to the fourth element, the treatment of similarly-situated workers, Complainant  did not present evidence that any comparable employee at Old Time Tap was treated better than she  was in similar circumstances.  Again, she failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she  was treated differently from employees without a perceived or actual disability.   In  summary,  the  hearing  officer  concluded  that  Complainant  did  not  establish  by  a  preponderance of the evidence that she was fired because of a disability or perceived disability, and  her  complaint  should  be  dismissed.  The  Commission  accepts  and  adopts  the  hearing  officer's  recommended findings  of fact  as  well  as  her conclusion that Complainant has failed to meet her  burden of proof that she was subjected to discrimination based on perceived disability.   IV   Conclusion   For these reasons, the Commission adopts the hearing officer's recommendations and finds   for Respondent.   c:;:s::C M   JAW.\)   By:   Dana V.

In mid-August, our private contractor will begin the work to install a new sewer in S.  Vernon Avenue (81st Street-80th Street), in E. 80th Street (Vernon-St. Lawrence), in S. Evans  Avenue (81st Street-80th Street), and in E. 80th Street (Evans-Champlain).  The old sewer  dates back to 1913 and needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will  be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    6th Ward Office: 773-635-0006    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Randy Conner  Commissioner of Water Management

Daley  Mayor  Steven J. Lux  City Comptroller  March 14, 2008  BENEFITS BULLETIN  IT’S TIME FOR SPRING SCHOOL TERM   PROOF OF STUDENT STATUS  If your continuous service date shows you were hired on or after August  1,  1984,  and  if  you  are  not  a  sworn  police  officer  or  a  uniformed  firefighter,  medical  benefits  for your eligible dependent(s) will terminate at midnight prior to their 19th birthday.  Medical benefits can be extended until their 22nd birthday, if you submit satisfactory “proof of student status” in both the Spring and Fall each year (within required time frame) confirming  that  your  eligible  dependent(s)  are  full-time students at an accredited college or university.  Important  Note: The  student’s  school  determines  the  definition of full-time.  Dental  benefits  will  terminate  for  your  eligible  dependent(s) at midnight prior to their 19th birthday whether they are full-time students or not.   Call  the  Health  Care  Services  Corporation (HCSC)  at  1-888-541-7107  to find  out  more  about continuation  of  dental  and/or  medical  coverage through the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) program.  If you are a sworn police officer or a uniformed firefighter, or  if  your  continuous  service  date  shows  you  were  hired before August  1,  1984,  proof  of  student  status  is  not required for your eligible dependents.  For  complete  details  about  dependent  age  limits  for medical  and  dental  benefits, please  visit  the  “general information”  section  of  the  Benefits  Management Division  website  www.cityofchicago.org/benefits and click on the words: Frequently Asked Questions.  Important Reminder: The deadline for the current Spring school term proof of  student status for continuation of medical benefits is Monday, March 31, 2008. The following two documents must be submitted to the Benefits Management Division  twice a year or your eligible dependent(s) will not have medical benefits through the  City of Chicago for the full calendar year:  1) Original letter dated after 2/1/08 from the school’s Registrar’s Office confirming  full-time student status for the current school term.  2) Copy of full or partially paid tuition bill or grants for the current school term.  (SEE REVERSE SIDE)  3/08  UNDERSTANDING PROOF OF STUDENT STATUS GUIDELINES  • The letter from the school’s Registrar’s Office is often issued on the school’s  multicolored letterhead or has a raised seal. It cannot be a photocopy or a facsimile (fax). It cannot be dated prior to February. 1, 2008 for the current Spring school term. It must state the student is enrolled on a “full-time” basis.  • The student’s name must appear on the copy of full or partially paid tuition bill or  grants for the current school term.  Various forms of proof of payment are acceptable including a copy of the student’s grant letter or student account printed from the Internet. The bill must be at least partially paid.  UNDERSTANDING FAMILY STATUS CHANGE GUIDELINES  If you wish to add or drop an eligible dependent from your coverage, you must wait until the annual open enrollment period unless you experience a qualifying Family Status Change during the year:  Examples of family status changes  include the following:  Here are some examples of changes NOT considered family status changes:  • your marriage or divorce • your enrollment or termination of an eligible  domestic partner  • birth or adoption of a child • death of a spouse or covered dependent • a covered dependent reaching the   limiting age, or   • a change in employment status for you   or your spouse  You must submit an enrollment form to the Benefits Management Division to add/delete within 30 days  of family status changes. You must also submit acceptable documentation to support the change in coverage within 60 days of your request.  1) You get married but you don’t notify the  Benefits Management Division for six months. Since you didn’t request coverage for the spouse within 30 days of your marriage, you will have to wait until the next open enrollment period to add your new spouse.  2) You decide that you no longer want coverage  for your children. Since this is not a family status change, you’ll have to wait until the next open enrollment period to drop coverage for your children.  IMPORTANT REMINDER IF YOU DIVORCE YOUR SPOUSE:  You Must Drop All Ineligible Dependents Including Divorced Spouses Or   You Will Be Billed The Cost Of Coverage And/Or Risk Financial Consequences.  3/08

By mid January 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 5,541 feet of new 8-inch water main in W. Fifth  Avenue, from S. Kostner Avenue to W. Harrison Street, S. Tripp Avenue, from W. Harrison Street to  W. Arthington Street, S. Kedvale Avenue, from W. Fifth Avenue to W. Arthington Street and   W. Harrison Street, from S. Pulaski Road to S. Springfield Avenue. The old water main dates back to  1893, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  24th Ward Office: 773-533-2400  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016
