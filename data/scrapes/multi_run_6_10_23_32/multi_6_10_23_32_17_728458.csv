After careful consideration of the facts and the relevant law, the Board finds that the Ordinance does not prohibit you from approaching [the Commissioner], although it does place certain restrictions on your future conduct while a City employee.  This advisory opinion reviews the facts you presented and sets forth the Board’s analysis and conclusions.   FACTS:  You  have  been  the  [  regional  administrator  ]  of  the  [  ...  ] Neighborhood Health Center  within the Chicago Department of Public Health for approximately the past 18 months.  As an administrator you oversee the core staff at the [ neighborhood ] clinic, as well as the various operations of the clinic, such as its ambulatory care facility.    Before being employed by the City, you were on [    a   state   ] Governor’s Task Force on Medical Communications Technology and were also a fellow at the American College of Health Care Executives.  Both of these experiences were instrumental in the development of     [                 Alpha                         ], a  set  of  data  elements  that  you  hope  will  one  day  constitute  the  essential structure in a healthcare management information system.  You said that in April  1998,  you  received  a  patent  for  [      Alpha          ]  and  also  received  a copyright for the research on which it is based   [                  ...                    ].  The current healthcare management information system used by the City is called  Global  System.    Although  you  are  uncertain  about  the  details,  you believe that the City acquired it under a contract that is about to expire.  As with  most  health  care  management  information  systems,  Global  System provides some information about healthcare providers (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes), payers (e.g. Blue Cross), suppliers (e.g. pharmaceutical companies) and consumers.  With this system, the relevant employees of the City can find out how many patients are seen by a particular hospital, which doctors saw them, and so forth. You stated that you use the system for basic information searches and receive  reports  that are generated  by the system at the central  Re: Case No. 00011.A September 13, 2000 Page 2  office.  You said that you did not have a hand in training individuals to use Global, and that you did not have any input in the City’s decision to use it.     In your opinion, Global System is inadequate on at least two levels.  First, its software does not carry out many of the tasks for which it is designed.  You attribute this first failure to poor linkage of databases and unsuitable algorithms, which direct the system in obtaining and organizing data.  The second inadequacy of Global System, in your opinion, is that it does not include enough data or categorize that data effectively.    You believe that [Alpha], with what you characterize as its well-considered and near-exhaustive set of  data  elements  (5,750  of  them),  could  either  complement  or  replace  Global  System.    More specifically, you said that the set of data elements will address the second inadequacy in Global System — that it does not include enough data and does not categorize the data effectively.  You stated that the repository capabilities of [Alpha], which enable it to collect and store data, and its ability to organize this data could be very valuable to the City’s Department of Public Health, as well as to suppliers, consumers, payers, and so forth.  You claimed that it would enable one to track, benchmark and compare, among other things, demographic information about patients, the number of employees per square footage at hospitals, the kind of tests ordered by doctors, practice patterns of different doctors and institutions, the reasons for and numbers of complaints and grievances at a particular hospital, which tests providers have ordered, and so forth.  Before  [Alpha]  could  be  put  into  practice,  however,  you  estimate  that  [Alpha]  would  require approximately six months of development work, devoted to designing a database platform.  You do not anticipate the City would be involved with this development.  You stated that you believe that this development work would need to be performed by a company such as Oracle Corporation. You estimated these development costs at around 8 to 9 million dollars, and you expect that you would need to enlist the support of venture capital in order to fund the development.  You said that you would expect to be paid for your ideas and labor by these venture capitalists. You stated that, at this point in time, you have not yet approached any companies such as Oracle or any venture capitalists.     You said that you would like to approach the Commissioner of the Department of Public Health  [      ...      ] to ""see if [s/he] might be interested"" in using [Alpha] once it is developed.  You indicated that any endorsement or expression of interest by [the Commissioner] could then be parleyed by you to venture capitalists, as positive evidence of the potential of [Alpha].  Once [Alpha] is developed, you envision offering a 5 or 10 year license to the City for the use of [Alpha], free of charge.  LAW & ANALYSIS  1.  Section 2-156-090(a)     The first section of the Ordinance that applies to your situation is 2-156-090(a), ""Representation of Other Persons,"" which provides, in relevant part:  Re: Case No. 00011.A September 13, 2000 Page 3  No...  employee  may  represent...  any  person  other  than  the  City  in  any  formal  or informal proceeding or transaction before any City agency in which the agency’s action or non-action is of a nonministerial nature; provided that nothing in this subsection shall preclude any employee from performing the duties of his employment....  This provision prohibits City employees from representing persons other than the City in certain situations.  In the past, the Board has interpreted such representation as applying to a broad range of activities in which one person acts as a spokesperson for someone other than the City, and seeks to communicate or promote the interests of that party.     In prior Board cases decided under §2-156-090 of the Ordinance, there has always been an explicitly identified third party — such as a corporation —  in addition to the City and the individual employee. See Case No. 89126.A  The instant case marks the first time the Board has addressed the question of whether a person, speaking on his or her own behalf (as you would be if you approached [the Commissioner    ]), should be understood to be ""representing a person other than the City,” within the meaning of  §2-156-090.    Nevertheless,  in  past  post-employment  cases,  decided  under  §2-156-100  of  the  Ordinance1,  the Board has addressed a similar question regarding representation.  In both Case Nos. 93018.A and 99010.A, the Board determined that the Ordinance does not prohibit consulting agreements between the City and its former employees provided, among other conditions, the former employee does not represent the interests of any other entity in connection with his or her responsibilities to the City.  In its reasoning in Case No.  99010.A, the Board made the following observation:   If you were to consult with the City in your capacity  as  an employee of your own  professional services  corporation,  however,  you  would  be  assisting  or  representing  a  third  party  —  the corporation — and, as such,  would be confronted with a situation in which you would owe loyalties to both the City and to your corporation — a situation the Board viewed in Case No. 93018.A as the major harm contemplated by the post-employment provisions.  The fact that you would be the sole owner,  shareholder,  officer,  and  employee  of  the  corporation  does  not  change  the  Board’s conclusion.  A corporation is a separate entity.  If your corporation were to enter into a consulting agreement under which you would personally  provide services to your former Department, you would owe a fiduciary duty to the corporation.  Id. at 4.   1In relevant part, the provision states: No former official or employee shall, for a period of one year after the termination of the official's or employee's term of office or employment, assist or represent any person in any business transaction involving the City or any of its agencies, if the official or employee participated personally and substantially in the subject matter of the transaction during his term of office or employment.  Re: Case No. 00011.A September 13, 2000 Page 4  In the instant case, the Board concludes that a similar distinction is appropriate; that is, as long as you are acting merely as an individual when you approach [the Commissioner], and not as part of a larger business enterprise, whether a corporation, a partnership or some other kind of organization, you are not “representing a person other than the City,” in the sense that is prohibited by Section  2-156-090.  It is important to emphasize, however, that if your situation should change — if, for example, you incorporate or enter into some kind of agreement with a database platform developer, a venture capitalist, and so forth — you should re-contact the Board with the relevant details, so that we may advise you on how the Ordinance applies to your new situation.  2.  Section 2-156-080(a) A  second  Ordinance  provision  relevant  to  your  situation  is  Section  2-156-080(a),  ""Conflicts  of Interest; Appearance of Impropriety.""  It states, in pertinent part:  No ... employee shall make or participate in the making of any governmental decision with respect to any matter in which he has any economic interest distinguishable from that of the general public.  The Ordinance defines an ""economic interest"" in §2-156-010(i) as ""any interest valued or capable of valuation in monetary terms....""  At this point, [Alpha] is an idea in need of development, not a finished product that someone could purchase and then put into immediate use.  Nonetheless, since you  expect  to  profit  from  [Alpha]  when  you  enter  into  an  agreement  with  a  database  platform developer and a venture capitalist, it is reasonable to conclude that [Alpha] is capable of valuation in monetary terms, even in its present underdeveloped state, and that you have an economic interest in [Alpha] that is distinct from the interests of the general public.  The  conflict  of  interest  provision  prohibits  City  employees  from  participating  in  or  making governmental decisions or actions in which they have an ""economic interest"" (as defined) that is distinguishable from that of the public.  When fully developed, [Alpha], you suggest, could replace Global Systems, the healthcare management information system that the City presently uses. Since you have an economic interest in [Alpha], it follows that governmental decisions involving  [Alpha] as  an  alternative  or  supplemental  healthcare  management  information  system  may  affect  your economic interest.  Therefore, in your City employment you are prohibited from participating in governmental decisions about [Alpha].  Furthermore, given that your participation in any decision about keeping, replacing or supplementing the Department’s healthcare management information system,  whether  or  not  these  decisions  make  explicit  reference  to  [Alpha],  may  present  the appearance of impropriety, we strongly recommend that you recuse yourself from these decisions as well.  3.  Section 2-156-110 A  third  Ordinance  provision  that  might  apply  to  your  situation  is  §2-156-110,  ""Interest  in  City Business,"" which states, in relevant part:  Re: Case No. 00011.A September 13, 2000 Page 5  No ... employee shall have a financial interest in his own name or in the name of any other person in any contract, work or business of the City, or in the sale of any article, whenever the expense, price or consideration of the contract, work, business or sale is paid with funds belonging to or administered by the City, or is authorized by  ordinance...  At present, a contract or other agreement with the City involving the use or sale of [Alpha] appears rather remote.  Should such a possibility materialize in the future, however, we advise you to contact the Board for specific advice on how the Ordinance would apply.  Conceivably, if your interest in such an agreement were to give you a ""financial interest"" in City business, you might be obligated to resign your position with the City in order to proceed with the agreement.  DETERMINATION: The Board determines that the Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit you from approaching  [            the  Commissioner            ]  of  the  Department  of  Public  Health  to  solicit  the Department’s  interest  in  your  [              Alpha  data  elements  set          ].    However,  once  you  have approached [ the Commissioner ], you are prohibited from participating in governmental decisions about [Alpha], and furthermore, we recommend that you recuse yourself from all discussions about keeping, replacing, or supplementing the Department’s healthcare management information systems, whether or not these decisions make explicit reference to [Alpha], in order to prevent the appearance of impropriety.  Finally, if a contract or other agreement with the City involving the use or sale of [Alpha] should materialize in the future, we advise you to contact the Board for specific advice on how the Ordinance applies.  The Board’s opinion is not necessarily dispositive of all issues relevant to this situation, but is based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify us immediately, as any change may alter our opinion.  Other laws or rules also may apply to this situation.  Be advised that City departments have the authority to adopt and enforce rules of conduct that may be more restrictive than the limitations imposed by the Ethics Ordinance.  We appreciate your inquiry and your  concern to abide  by the standards embodied in the Ethics Ordinance.    We  enclose  a  copy  of  the  Ordinance  for  your  reference.    If  you  have  any  further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.  RELIANCE: This opinion may be relied upon by (1) any person involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered and (2) any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.

In early October, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install a  new  sewer  in  North  Spaulding  Avenue  from  North  Elston  Avenue  to  200’  N  of  West  Waveland Avenue. The old sewer needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons.  Outside of  working hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.  You will always be able  to reach your home or business.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We  know  that  construction  always  involves  inconveniences  and  noise.  We  will  do  everything  possible  to  maintain  your  quality  of  life  throughout  these  projects,  and  conducting  ourselves  as  good  and  thoughtful  neighbors  in  the  course  of  our  presence  on  your street.     Should  you  have  any  questions  or  concerns,  you  can  either ask  the  construction  foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    33rd Ward Office:  773-478-8040    35th Ward Office:  773-887-3772    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.

I want to be certain  you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you  have any questions or concerns.    Our crews will soon be installing 2,122 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Albany  Ave. (W. Diversey Ave. to N. Avondale Ave.), W. Wellington Ave. (N. Troy St.  to N. Whipple St.) and W. George St. (N. Albany Ave. to N. Whipple St.). The old  main dates back to 1891 and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Colon’s office, and he has made clear we are  to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project.  Good communications is the  key.    I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely.  We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.    If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.      Thank you for your understanding and good will.      Sincerely    Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner      cc:   Alderman Rey Colon     35th Ward                                                Do you wonder what was happening in 1891?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                              Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap   and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.               PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 2,122 feet of 8-inch water main in  N. Albany Ave. (W. Diversey Ave. to N. Avondale Ave.), W. Wellington Ave. (N. Troy St. to  N. Whipple St.) and W. George St. (N. Albany Ave. to N. Whipple St.).    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1891 and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Water main installation is anticipated to begin early April, with completion of this  project projected for late July. Completion of this project includes restoration. This, of course, is  an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected developments in the street, or other circumstances  (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Albany Ave., W. Wellington Ave. and W. George  St. without interruption, but we will have to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1   ALDERMAN REY COLON   773-365-3535   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                     FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July. This  includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of  other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

Protect yourself and your family by following these steps:    Inside the Home  •  Keep children and pets out of the affected area until cleanup has been completed.  •  Wear rubber boots, rubber gloves, and goggles during cleanup of affected area.  •  Remove and discard items that cannot be washed and disinfected (such as, mattresses, carpeting,   carpet padding, rugs, upholstered furniture, cosmetics, stuffed animals, baby toys, pillows, foam- rubber items, books, wall coverings, and most paper products).   •  Remove and discard drywall and insulation that has been contaminated with sewage or flood waters.   •  Thoroughly clean all hard surfaces (such as flooring, concrete, molding, wood and metal furniture,   countertops, appliances, sinks, and other plumbing fixtures) with hot water and laundry or dish  detergent.   •  Help the drying process by using fans, air conditioning units, and dehumidifiers.  •  After completing the cleanup, wash your hands with soap and water. Use water that has been boiled   for 1 minute (allow the water to cool before washing your hands).    o  Or you may use water that has been disinfected for personal hygiene use (solution of ⅛   teaspoon [~0.75 milliliters] of household bleach per 1 gallon of water). Let it stand for 30  minutes. If the water is cloudy, use solution of ¼ teaspoon (~1.5 milliliters) of household  bleach per 1 gallon of water.    •  Wash all clothes worn during the cleanup in hot water and detergent. These clothes should be washed   separately from uncontaminated clothes and linens.   •  Wash clothes contaminated with flood or sewage water in hot water and detergent. It is recommended   that a laundromat be used for washing large quantities of clothes and linens until your onsite waste- water system has been professionally inspected and serviced.  •  Seek immediate medical attention if you become injured or ill.    Outside the Home  •  Keep children and pets out of the affected area until cleanup has been completed.    •  Wear rubber boots, rubber gloves, and goggles during cleanup of affected area.  •  Have your onsite waste-water system professionally inspected and serviced if you suspect damage.  •  Wash all clothes worn during the cleanup in hot water and detergent.

Ada Street, from W. Hubbard Street to W. Kinzie Street, N. Ada Street, from   N. Ogden Avenue to W. Carroll Avenue and N. Ada Street, from W. Fulton Street to W. Lake Street.  The old water main dates back to 1883, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  27th Ward Office: 312-432-1995  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Acting Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

The ordinance goes into effect July 1, 2017. The ordinance applies to employers that maintain a business  facility within the City of Chicago and/or are required to obtain a business license to operate in the City.  Employees of an employer that is subject to the Ordinance who work at least 80 hours within any 120-day  period qualify. This includes domestic employees, day laborers, tipped workers, and home health care workers.  How is Paid Sick Leave Calculated?  • Paid sick leave begins to accrue either on the 1st calendar day after the start of employment or on July 1,   2017, whichever is later.  • For every 40 hours worked, an employee earns one hour of paid sick leave in full hour increments. • Salaried employees who are exempt from overtime requirements shall accrue one hour of Paid Sick Leave   for each week of employment.    • Paid sick leave hours are capped at 40 hours per 12-month period unless the employer sets a higher limit. • At the end of a 12-month accrual period, employees must be allowed to carry over up to half of unused   paid sick leave (a maximum of 20 hours) unless the employer sets a higher limit.  • If subject to Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), each employee must be allowed to carry over up to  40 hours of unused paid sick leave, in addition to half of all unused paid sick time, to use exclusively for  FMLA-eligible purposes.  What are Employee Rights Under the Ordinance?  Employees may use paid sick leave when: • They are ill or injured, or to receive medical care, treatment, diagnosis or preventative medical care; • A family member is ill or injured, or to care for a family member receiving medical care, treatment,   diagnosis or preventative medical care;  • They or a family member are victims of domestic violence or sex offense; or • Their place of business is closed by order of a public official due to public health emergency, or they have   a child who needs care because their school or place or care is closed due to a public health emergency. • Employees who believe they have not received paid sick leave may call 311 to report a violation of the   Ordinance to the City of Chicago.  • A complaint affidavit must be fully completed and returned to BACP to initiate an investigation. • Employees are not required to provide, and the City will not request, information regarding the   immigration status of any person filing a complaint.  • BACP does not act as the employee’s private attorney. Any employee has the right to file a private civil   action against the employer in circuit court if the employer violated the provisions of the Ordinance.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 551 feet of 8-inch water main in E. 114th Street, from S.  Cottage Grove Avenue to the Alley East of S. Langley Avenue. The old pipe dates back to1890,  and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Beale’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                                                                                114TH STREET WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 551 feet of 8-inch water  main in E. 114th Street, from S. Cottage Grove Avenue to the Alley East of S. Langley Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by mid July 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on E. 114th Street outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                  CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN ANTHONY BEALE    773-785-1100                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid July 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!
