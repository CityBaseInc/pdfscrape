You requested an advisory opinion on whether this president, or the trade association itself, must register as a lobbyist.  Under the facts presented, the Board has determined that the president of the trade association, but not the association itself, is acting as a lobbyist.  If the president’s lobbying-related compensation or expenditures total $1,000 or more in the preceding or current calender year, he must register as a lobbyist and file semi-annual reports of lobbying activities with the Board.  A summary of the facts and relevant law follow, along with the Board’s analysis.  FACTS,  RELEVANT  LAW  AND  ANALYSIS:    Your  client  is  a  trade association  that  wishes  to  have  its  president  appear  before  the  Finance Committee  of  City  Council  and  make  unsolicited,  public  comment  on  a proposed  ordinance.    Section  2-156-010(p)  of  the  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance defines a lobbyist as:   .  .  . any person (i) who for compensation or on behalf of any person other than himself undertakes to influence any legislative or administrative action; or (ii) any part of whose duties as an employee of another includes undertaking to influence any legislative or administrative action.   Section 2-156-010(o) of the Ordinance defines “legislative action” as:  .  .  .  the  introduction,  sponsorship,  consideration,  debate, amendment, passage, defeat, approval, veto or other official action or non-action on any ordinance, resolution, motion, order, appointment, application or other matter pending or proposed  in  the  City  Council  or  any  committee  or subcommittee thereof.  You have said that the president of the association is “unpaid” and “is not an employee” of the association.  However, in making the proposed comments, he  Case No. 98056.A December 16, 1998 Page 2  would clearly be undertaking to influence legislative action on behalf of a person other than himself, i.e., the association. Section 2-156-010(o) explicitly includes debate on an ordinance in the definition of “legislative action.”  Thus, under the facts presented, the president of the trade association is acting as a lobbyist.  Next, the Board considers the issue of whether the president of the trade association must register with the Board as a lobbyist.  Section 2-156-210 of the Ordinance provides:  each  lobbyist  whose  lobbying-related  compensation  or  expenditures  total $1,000.00 or more in the preceding or current calendar year shall register and file reports with the Board of Ethics.   Section 2-156-010(f) defines “compensation” as:  money, thing of value or other pecuniary benefit received or to be received in return for, or as reimbursement for, services rendered or to be rendered.  Section 2-156-010(k) defines “expenditure” as:   a payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value.  The  fact  that  the  president  of  the  association  is  “unpaid”  is  not  dispositive  of  whether  he  must register.  Under the Ordinance, compensation is not limited to money; rather, it includes any thing of value or other pecuniary benefit received or to be received in return for, or as reimbursement for, services.    Furthermore,  although  your  letter  does  not  indicate  whether  you  anticipate  that  the president of the trade association will incur expenditures, e.g. payment of transportation and lodging costs, in relation to his lobbying activities, that, too, must be considered.  In conclusion, if either the compensation received or the expenditures made by the association's president in the preceding or current calendar year total $1,000 or more, the president must register as a lobbyist and file semi- annual reports of lobbying activities with the Board.  Finally, the Board concludes that the trade association itself is not acting as a lobbyist under the facts presented.  In situations where a company hires a lobbyist in an effort to influence legislative or administrative action, it has not been the Board’s practice to require the company itself to register as a lobbyist, even though the company could be said to be acting on behalf of its shareholders; the disclosure intended by the Ordinance is made when the lobbyist identifies the company as a client in the lobbyist’s own registration.  In the present situation as well, the Board does not believe that any purpose would be served by requiring the trade association to register as a lobbyist, or that the association is in fact acting as a lobbyist on behalf of its members, under the intent of the Ordinance.  DETERMINATIONS: The Board determines that the unpaid president of a trade association is acting as a lobbyist when, on behalf of the association, he appears before City Council and makes  Case No. 98056.A December 16, 1998 Page 3  unsolicited, public comment on a pending ordinance.  The Board also determines that the trade association itself, under the facts presented, is not acting as a lobbyist.  If the president’s lobbying- related compensation or expenditures total $1,000 or more in the preceding or current calender year, he must register as a lobbyist and file semi-annual reports of lobbying activities with the Board.  Our determinations are based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify the Board immediately, as any change may alter our determination.   RELIANCE: This opinion may be relied upon by (1) any person involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered and (2) any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.  __________________ Darryl L.

By early January 2018, Department of Water Management (DWM) and NPL Construction Company  crews will begin the work to install 9,219 feet of new 8-inch water main in W. Eddy Street, from   N. Long Avenue to N. Cicero Avenue, W. Cornelia Avenue, from N. Long Avenue to N. Cicero Avenue,  N. Long Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W. Cornelia Avenue and N. Lavergne Avenue, from   W. Addison Street to W. Cornelia Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1909, and needs to be  replaced. We expect the water main work to be completed by late March 2018. Restoration will  follow in mid April 2018. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  30th Ward Office: 773-794-3095      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,   Randy Conner  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

Matthew Imig, President     Applicant (Expansion of Use)   for the premises located at     2249 North Lincoln Avenue            vs.                                           Local Liquor Control Commission     Department of Business Affairs & Licensing   Scott V. Bruner, Director                   OPINION OF COMMISSIONER KOPPEL      ORDER    LAC Case No.  06 LA 05    )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )   This matter comes before the License Appeal Commission on the refusal of the Mayor=s   License Commission to grant an expansion of use to an applicant who has been in business for   many years without violation.  The expansion of the premises would allow a private party room   on the second floor.  It should be noted again that no violations have been issued.  This place   serves food, but the Alderman and some area residents are opposed to the expansion of business   because it will add to the existing problems of the district.  The Mayor=s License Commission is   aware that this place has an incidental liquor license but is concerned that the expansion will be a   problem.  They are concerned that the establishment will serve more liquor than food and that   this will cause a deleterious impact upon the community.                                  1   The denial is predicated upon conjecture.  The law is quite clear.  This is a question of   due process.  The City is aware of the procedure, if a licensee with an incidental liquor license   sells more liquor than food, then his license is subject to revocation.  In the charging document   the City was aware of the law.  They indicated that it is the intent of this department to   investigate the applicant=s liquor versus food sales.  That is the remedy for selling more alcohol   than food.  To deny the expansion, when it met every criteria and with no violations as long as   they have been in business is unjust.        There are many ways to revoke a license.  This is called due process.  The City is aware   of the many reasons to revoke a license predicated upon violations of the law.  There are no   violations in this case.  To deny a legitimate business owner on conjecture is improper.  The City   is hereby reversed.       OPINION OF COMMISSIONER ADAMS    While the City=s witnesses were credible and concerned citizens, very few, if any,   testified about area problems that were directly tied to the licensed premises - O=Malley=s.         In fact, the evidence showed that the applicants are responsible businessmen who have   made sincere efforts to reach out to the community.  They have had no violations since obtaining   the business in 2000 and have passed every police check (6 of them) for underage sales.  Great   weight should be given to the testimony of the City authority closest to the scene, Beat Officer   Parada, who spoke well of the business and did not feel a liquor license extension for the second                       2   floor would have any negative or deleterious impact on the community.       The Local Liquor Control Commission=s denial was not proven by any bad acts attributed   to the applicants.  The City=s primary argument of Alet=s draw the line@ on alcohol sales is not   proof of a deleterious impact.        Good intentions of the City should not be considered a substitute for evidence.  The   denial of the application is reversed.         OPINION OF CHAIRMAN CALABRESE IN DISSENT    The licensee applicant seeks to expand his currently licensed liquor establishment.  The   applicant=s establishment is one of 14 liquor establishments located within a 2 block radius.  Six   of these licenses are tavern licenses, while eight are consumption on premises incidental activity   licenses.  The City denied the expansion on the grounds of deleterious impact, citing opposition   by the Alderman and community residents, as a result of existing problems in the neighborhood.          The local Alderman testified in opposition to the expansion of the license.  She pointed   out problems of public rowdiness and public urination already existing as a result of the over   saturation of liquor licenses in the two block area of the applicant=s establishment.  An applicant   witness, a Chicago Police Officer, testified that >lines of kids= are already waiting to be admitted   to the premises.                        3      The City presented many local residents who strongly objected to the expansion of the   license.  The citizens complained of littering, noise, public urination, fist fights and criminal   damage to property, as a result of what one witness referred to as the >alcohol tourism= of bar   hopping revelers.  Citizens complained that the applicants have not been considerate neighbors,   dumping refuse water out their back door into the alley and causing an odoriferous nuisance.    One neighbor complained that she has found underpants, condoms, liquor bottles and cans on her   lawn.  Parking was described as an enormous problem.  Citizens were very afraid that if this   expansion is allowed that it will set a precedent for the expansion of the other liquor   establishments allowing the problem as they suggested to >go vertical=.        The decision by the Local Liquor Control Commission simply denies the expansion of a   license in an area that has proven to be over saturated with liquor emporiums and is reeling with   the impact of rampant alcohol abuse by young people visiting the neighborhood.  The evidence   presented at the hearing of the abuses being suffered by the residents was as clear as can be.    There is no doubt that the expansion of this license would clearly contribute to an already   existing deleterious impact.  If the Local Liquor Control Commission is not allowed to deny   expansion in this case, then when can, as the witness and Corporation Counsel rightly argued,   the line be drawn?  I would have affirmed the City=s denial of the expansion.                                               4        THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED That the said order or action of the Local      Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago be and the same hereby is REVERSED.       Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a Petition for Rehearing may be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order is deemed  to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the Circuit Court, the  Petition for Rehearing must be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order, as  such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.
