Watercraft means any boat, vessel, or other craft used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.  Who is responsible for payment of the tax?  The individual being charged a mooring or docking fee is responsible for payment of the tax to the marina or docking facility.   Who is responsible for collection of the tax?  Effective January 1st, 2006, all Chicago mooring and docking facilities are responsible for collecting and remitting the tax to the Department.  The tax must be collected at the time the fee is collected.  Is there a commission granted for collecting and remitting the tax?  Yes, the collector is allowed a commission of 1% of the tax collected and timely remitted to the Department.  To be considered timely, the remittance and return must be physically received or received in an envelope postmarked by the Unites States Postal Service on or before the due date.  Per chapter 3-4 of the Municipal Code, late payments incur interest at a rate of 12% per annum simple interest, calculated daily, based on a 365 day calendar year and a late penalty rate of 5% of the tax due.  How often is the Boat Mooring Tax  remitted and when are returns due?  The tax is to be remitted monthly with taxes collected in one month payable by the last day of the subsequent month.  The tax return for periods commencing on July 1st of each year and ending on June 30 of the subsequent year, is filed annually and is due by August 15th of each year.  Questions?

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,492 feet of 8-inch water main in W. George Street, from N.  Avers Avenue to N. Ridgeway Avenue, N. Ridgeway Avenue, from W. George Street to W.  Diversey Avenue, and N. Lawndale Avenue, from N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Milwaukee Avenue.  The old pipe dates back to 1902, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Reboyras’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:             Animal Crackers were introduced to the American public.    Theodore Roosevelt became the first American President to ride in an automobile.    The first college football bowl game, the Rose Bowl between Michigan and Stanford,   was held in Pasadena, California.     JC Penney opened its first store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming.    The Texas Oil Company, Texaco, was formed.    Denmark became the first country to adopt fingerprinting as a way to identify criminals.    Richard J. Daley was born; he served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in   1976.        RICHARD J. DALEY                          GEORGE ST., RIDGEWAY AVE. & LAWNDALE AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,492 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. George Street, from N. Avers Avenue to N. Ridgeway Avenue, N. Ridgeway  Avenue, from W. George Street to W. Diversey Avenue, and N. Lawndale Avenue, from N.  Hamlin Avenue to N. Milwaukee Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1902 and needs to be replaced.     Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late June 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. George Street, N. Ridgeway Avenue, and N.  Lawndale Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to  close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business,  even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open  for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN ARIEL REBOYRAS   773-794-3095   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June 2014.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!
