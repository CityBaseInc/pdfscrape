By mid March 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark  Construction Company crews will begin the work to install 1,718 feet of new 8-inch water  main in N. Trumbull Avenue, from W. Grand Avenue to 160 feet north of W. Chicago  Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1901, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter  your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311   •  27th Ward Office: 312-432-1995  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for at least 5  minutes.  The aerator screens located at the tip of your faucets should be removed prior to  flushing.    This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, or any  lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line as a  result of the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your  water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.   It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes, if it has been idle or stagnant for  more than 6-hours.   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.     Sincerely,    Thomas Powers  Commissioner

This advisory opinion is based on the hypothetical facts presented by staff, and its application is limited to those facts.      FACTS:    Staff presents two sets of hypothetical facts:   Hypothetical  One.    A  City  employee  or  official  sits  as  a  member  of  a  City agency, board or commission.   During the course of a hearing conducted before that  body,  the  City official or employee examines a witness.  A vote, from which the employee or official recuses himself, is taken by the agency, board or commission at the conclusion of the hearing, resulting in a decision or action by that body.    Hypothetical  Two.    A    City  employee  or  official  sits  as  the  chair  of  a  City agency, board or commission.  The City official or employee presides over a hearing conducted before that body.  The City official examines no witnesses during  the  hearing.  A  vote,  from  which  the  employee  or  official  recuses himself, is taken by the agency, board or commission at the conclusion of the hearing, resulting in a decision or action by that body.    RELEVANT  ORDINANCE  PROVISIONS:  (Improper Influence) states:    Section  2-156-030(a)  No  official  or  employee  shall  make,  participate  in  making  or  in  any  way attempt  to  use  his  position  to  influence  any  City  governmental  decision  or action in which he knows or has reason to know that he has any economic interest  distinguishable  from  its  effect  on  the  public  generally  (emphasis added).  Section 2-156-080(a) (Conflicts of Interest) states:  No  official  or  employee  shall  make  or  participate  in  the  making  of  any governmental decision with respect to any matter in which he has any economic interest distinguishable from that of the general public  (emphasis added).  Case No.  00008.A April 20, 2000 Page 2    QUESTIONS PRESENTED:   1.   2.  Does a City employee or official participate in [the] making [of] a governmental decision, within the meaning of sections 2-156-030(a) and 2-156-080(a) of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance, if,  as a member of a City agency, board or commission, he examines a witness testifying during a hearing before that body which results in a decision or action by that body?   Does a City employee or official participate in [the] making [of] a governmental decision, within the meaning of sections 2-156-030(a) and 2-156-080(a) of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance, if he presides over a  hearing  before a City  agency, board or commission which results in a decision or action by that body?  BOARD PRECEDENT:  This is a case of first impression for the Board.  APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS: The phrase “participate in [the] making [of] a governmental decision” is not defined in the Governmental Ethics Ordinance.  Nor has the phrase been construed to date by Board opinion.  The  ordinary meaning of the word “participate” is “to join or share with others: take part.”  Webster’s II, New Riverside University Dictionary  (1984).  With  regard  to  the  first  question,  the  Board  notes  that  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  defines  the “examination” of a witness as “...the series of questions put to him by a party to the action, or his counsel, for the purpose of bringing before the  court...the knowledge which the witness has of the facts and matters in dispute, or of probing and sifting his evidence previously given.”  Black’s Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition, West (1979).  By virtue of the critical function an examination fulfills–the presentation and probing of evidence–the Board finds that “to examine a witness” during the course of a hearing, in one’s capacity as a member of the body before which that hearing is being conducted, is to “take part” in the hearing and, thereby,  in the ultimate decision made by that body, even if one does not “take part” in the vote.      As to the second question, the Board notes that Black’s Law Dictionary defines “preside” as “to occupy  the  place  of  authority  as  of  president,  chairman,  moderator,  etc.;  to  direct,  control  or regulate proceedings as chief officer, moderator, etc.; to possess or exercise authority....” Id.  By virtue  of  the  authority,  and  the  ability  to  direct  or  control,  inherent  in  the  position  of  one  who presides, the Board finds that “to preside” over a hearing is to “take part” in the hearing and, thereby, in the ultimate decision made by that body, even if one does not “take part” in the examination of witnesses or in the vote.        DETERMINATIONS:   Accordingly, the Board determines that:  Case No.  00008.A April 20, 2000 Page 3    1.  2.  a City employee or official participates in [the] making [of] a governmental decision, within the  meaning  of  sections  2-156-030(a)  and  2-156-080(a)  of  the  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance, if, as a member of a City agency, board or commission, he examines a witness testifying during a hearing before that body which results in a decision or action by that body; and   a City employee or official participates in [the] making [of] a governmental decision, within the  meaning  of  sections  2-156-030(a)  and  2-156-080(a)  of  the  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance, if he presides over a  hearing  before a City  agency, board or commission which results in a decision or action by that body.  Our determinations are not necessarily dispositive of all issues relevant to this situation, but are based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  Other laws or rules also may apply to this situation.  Be advised that City departments have  the  authority  to  adopt  and  enforce  rules  of  conduct  that  may  be  more  restrictive  than  the limitations imposed by the Ethics Ordinance.   RELIANCE:  This opinion may be relied upon by any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.  __________________ Darryl L.

I want to be certain  you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you  have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,320 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Lawndale  Avenue, from W. Cortland Street to W. Armitage Avenue, and in N. Monticello  Avenue, from W. Cortland Street to W. Armitage Avenue. The old main dates  back to 1887 and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Maldonado’s office, and he has made clear we  are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas H. Powers, P.E.   Commissioner       cc: Alderman Roberto Maldonado        26th Ward                                                       Do you wonder what was happening in 1887?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                                               Anne Sullivan began teaching 6 year old, blind and deaf Helen Keller.    Oregon became the first state to make Labor Day a holiday.    Britain celebrated the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.    Susanna Medora Salter was elected the first U.S. woman mayor (Argonia, Kansas).    The fire escape was patented.    Boris Karloff, an icon of horror cinema, was born.                    PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,320 feet of 8-inch water main in  N. Lawndale Avenue, from W. Cortland Street to W. Armitage Avenue, and in N. Monticello  Avenue, from W. Cortland Street to W. Armitage Avenue.           Reason: The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1887, and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Work starts in April, and we expect the job to be completed in late June (restoration  will follow in late July). This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected  developments in the street, or other circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our  schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Lawndale Avenue and N. Monticello Avenue  without interruption, but we will have to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS         24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   ALDERMAN ROBERTO MALDONADO   773-773-395-0143   3-1-1         312-742-1029   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June.  Restoration will follow in late July. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are  at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

H.   The Park District is a taxing district under the Act.   I.   The  Plan  contemplates  that  tax  increment  financing  assistance  would  be  provided for public improvements,  such  as  the  Project,  within,  or adjacent to,  the  boundaries  of  the Galewood/Armitage Redevelopment Area.   J.   DZLUP  wishes   the  Park  District  a  portion  of  the  Galewood/Armitage  Increment in  an  amount not to  exceed  $300,000  (the ""Project Assistance"")  for the purpose of funding the Project in the Park (the ""TIF-Funded Improvements"") to the extent  and in the manner provided in the Agreement (as hereinafter defined).   to  make  available  to   K.   In  accordance with  the Act,  the  TIF-Funded  Improvements shall  include  such  of  the  Park  District's  capital  costs  necessarily  incurred  or  to  be  incurred  in  furtherance  of  the  objectives  of the  Plan,  and the City has found that the TIF-Funded  Improvements consist of the  cost  of the  Park  District's  capital  improvements  that  are  necessary and  directly  result from  the  redevelopment  project constituting the  Project  and,  therefore,  constitute  ""taxing  districts'  capital  costs"" as defined in  Section 5/11-7 4.4-3(u) of the Act.   L.   The City and the  Park District wish to enter into this Agreement whereby the  City   shall pay for or reimburse the Park District for a portion of the TIF-Funded Improvements.   M.   On  March  18,  2009,  the  City  Council  adopted  an  ordinance  published  in  the  Journal  of  Proceedings  for  said  date  at  pages  55829  - 55846,  (the  ""Authorizing  Ordinance""),  among other things,  authorizing the execution of this Agreement.   N.   On  November 12,  2008,  the  Park  District's  Board  of Commissioners  adopted  an  order  expressing  its  desire  to  cooperate  with  the  City  in  the  construction  of the  Project  and  authorizing the execution of this Agreement (the ""Park District Ordinance"");   NOW,  THEREFORE,   in  consideration  of  the  mutual  covenants  and  agreements  contained  herein,  the  above  recitals  which  are  made  a contractual  part  of this  Agreement,  and  other  good  and  valuable  consideration  the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  are  hereby  acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:   TERMS AND CONDITIONS   SECTION  1.

The  Project  shall  at  a  minimum  meet  the  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Project  Description  in  Exhibit  8  hereof and  comply with  plans  and  specifications to  be  provided  to  and  approved  by  DZLUP  prior to  the  commencement  of the  Project  (""Plans  and  Specifications"")  in   2   order  for  the  Park  District  to  qualify  for  the  disbursement  of  Galewood/Armitage  Increment  funds.  No  material  deviation from  the  Plans  and  Specifications  may  be  made  without the  prior  written  approval of the  City.  The  Park District shall comply with  all  applicable federal,  state and  local laws,  statutes,  ordinances,  rules,  regulations,  codes  and  executive orders,  all as  may be  in  effect  from  time  to  time,  pertaining  to  or  affecting  the  Project  or  the  Park  District  as  related  thereto.   1.3.   At such time as the Park District lets a contract or contracts,  the form(s)  of which  shall  be  determined  solely  by  the  Park  District,  for  the  Project,  the  Park  District  shall  also  provide the City with copies,  if any shall apply,  of all governmental licenses and permits required  to  construct the  Project  and  to  use,  occupy  and  operate  the  Property  as  a public  park from  all  appropriate  governmental  authorities,  including  evidence  that  the  Property  is  appropriately  zoned to be  used,  occupied and operated as a public park.   1.4.   The  Park  District shall  include a certification of compliance with the  requirements  of Sections  1.1,  1.2,  and  1.3  hereof with  each  request for Galewood/Armitage  Increment funds  hereunder  and  at  the  time  the  Project  is  completed.  The  City  shall  be  entitled  to  rely  on  this  certification  without  further  inquiry.

(c)   if the  Park  District  is  unable  to  satisfy  the  conditions  stated  in  this  Section  2.2  within  the  Satisfaction  Period,  either  Party  may  terminate  this  Agreement  by  providing written notice to the other Party.   2.3.   The  Park  District  may  request  that  a certificate(s)  of expenditure  in  the  form  of  Exhibit  C  hereto  (""Certificates  of  Expenditure"")  be  processed  and  executed  periodically.  The  City shall  not execute Certificates of Expenditure in the aggregate in  excess of the  actual  costs  of the  Project  that  are  TIF-Funded  Improvements.  Prior to  each  execution  of a  Certificate  of  Expenditure  by  the  City,  the  Park  District  shall  submit  documentation  regarding  the  applicable  expenditures to DZLUP.  Delivery by the  Park District to  DZLUP of any request for execution  by  the City of a Certificate of Expenditure hereunder shall,  in  addition to the items therein expressly  set forth,  constitute  a certification  to  the  City,  as  of the  date  of such  request for execution  of a  Certificate of Expenditure, that:   (a)   (b)   (c)   (d)   the  total  amount  of the  request  for the  Certificate  of Expenditure  represents  the  actual  amount payable to  (or paid to) the general contractor,  subcontractors,  and  other  parties  who  have  performed  work  on  or  otherwise  provided  goods  or  services in  connection with the Project,  and/or their payees;   all  amounts  shown  as  previous payments  on  the  current  request for a Certificate  of Expenditure have been  paid to the parties entitled to such  payment;   the Park District has approved all work and  materials for the current request for a  Certificate of Expenditure,  and such work and materials conform to the Plans and  Specifications previously approved by DZLUP;  and   the  Park  District is  in  compliance with  all  applicable federal,  state and  local  laws,  statutes,  ordinances,  rules,  regulations,  codes  and  executive  orders,  all  as  may  be  in  effect  from  time  to  time,  pertaining  to  or affecting  the  Project  or the  Park  District as  related thereto.   2.4.   The  City  shall  have  the  right,  in  its  discretion,  to  require  the  Park  District  to  submit further documentation as the  City may require  in  order to verify that the matters certified  to  in  Section  2.3  are  true  and  correct,  and  any execution  of a Certificate  of Expenditure  by the  City shall be subject to the City's review and approval of such documentation and its satisfaction  that  such  certifications  are  true  and  correct;  provided,  however,  that  nothing  in  this  sentence  shall be deemed to prevent the City from  relying  on  such certifications by the Park District.   2.5.   The current estimate of the cost of the Project is $490,000.  The Park District has  delivered to the Commissioner a project budget for the Project attached as  Exhibit D.  The  Park  District  certifies  that  it  has  identified  sources  of  funds  (including  the  Project  Assistance)  sufficient to  complete the  Project.  The  Park  District agrees that the  City will  only contribute the  Project Assistance  to  the  Project  and  that  all  costs  of completing  the  Project  over the  Project  Assistance  shall  be  the  sole  responsibility  of the  Park  District.  If the  Park  District at  any  point  does not have sufficient funds to complete the Project,  the Park District shall so notify the City in  writing,  and  the  Park  District  may  narrow  the  scope  of the  Project  (the  ""Revised  Project"")  as  agreed with the City in order to complete the Revised Project with the available funds.   4   2.6.   Exhibit  D contains  a  preliminary  list  of capital  improvements  and  other  costs,  if  any,  recognized  by  the  City  as  being  eligible  redevelopment  project  costs  under the  Act  with  respect  to  the  Project,  to  be  paid  for  out  of  the  Project  Assistance.  To  the  extent  the  TIF(cid:173) Funded  Improvements  are  included  as  taxing  district  capital  costs  under  the  Act,  the  Park  District  acknowledges  that  the  TIF-Funded  Improvements  are  costs  for  capital  improvements  and  the  City  acknowledges  it  has  determined  that  these  TIF-Funded  Improvements  are  necessary  and  directly  result  from  the  Plan.  Prior to  the  expenditure  of Project Assistance  on  ·the Project,  the  Commissioner,  based  upon the project budget,  may make such  modifications to  Exhibit D as  he  or she wishes  in  his or her discretion to  account for all  of the  Project Assistance  to  be  expended  under this  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that  all  TIF-Funded  Improvements  shall  (i)  qualify as  redevelopment project costs  under the Act,  (ii)  qualify as  eligible costs  under  the  Plan;  and  (iii)  be  improvements that the  Commissioner has agreed to  pay for out of Project  Assistance, subject to the terms of this Agreement.   2.7.   The  Park  District  hereby  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  City's  obligations  hereunder with  respect to  the  Project Assistance are  subject on  every respect to the  availability  of  funds  as  described  in  and  limited  by  this  Section  2. 7  and  Section  2.2.  If  no  funds  or  in  any  fiscal  period  of  the  City  for  insufficient  funds  are  appropriated  and  budgeted  disbursements  of the  Project Assistance,  then  the  City  will  notify the  Park  District  in  writing  of  that occurrence,  and the  City  may terminate this Agreement on  the earlier of the  last day of the  fiscal  period for which sufficient appropriation was made or whenever the funds appropriated for  disbursement under this Agreement are exhausted.   2.8.   If  the  aggregate  cost  of  the  Project  is  less  than  the  amount  of  the  Project  Assistance  contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  the  Park  District  shall  have  no  claim  to  the  difference  between  the  amount of the  Project Assistance  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and  the amount of the Project Assistance actually paid  by the City to the  Park District and expended  by the Park District on the Project.   SECTION 3.  TERM.   The term  of this Agreement shall commence on  the  Closing  Date and shall expire on the  date on  which  the  Galewood/Armitage  Industrial  Redevelopment Area  is  no  longer in  effect,  or  on  the date of termination of this Agreement according to its terms,  whichever occurs first.

By mid-May, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 3,919 feet of  new 12-inch water main in W. Armitage Avenue, from N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Kedzie Avenue. The  old water main dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    26th Ward Office: 773-395-0143    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner      Genwmnot03032016
