By early December, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin  preliminary construction work at the intersections of Argyle and Natoma, and Argyle and  Rutherford. Following, our in-house crews will install 750 feet of new 12-inch sewer main in N.  Rutherford Avenue (Argyle-350 feet north) and in N. Natoma Avenue (Argyle-350 feet north).  The  old sewer main dates back to 1936, and needs to be replaced. DWM estimates the new sewer main  will be installed, and the street will be concrete capped by spring 2018.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  wwww.BuildingANewChicago.org to register for project notifications.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the project notifications, you will be informed as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always  be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open for  local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved by the start of  the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Parkway Maintenance  Before any project, the Department of Water Management (DWM) takes photographs of the street  and surrounding properties. These photographs help us restore the area to its preconstruction  state. However, DWM does not assume responsibility for damage to privately installed parkway  improvements, including sprinkling systems, fences, flower beds and shrubbery. New sewer  construction is not complete until damaged sidewalks, parkways and streets have been repaired.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    45th  Ward Office: 773-286-4545    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   This project involves replacing sewer structures that may have caused disruptions to your water  service line. We recommend that as a precaution you flush your water service of any sediment, rust  or metals, including any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside hose  spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where the  water comes into the home that is not used for drinking  water. Fully open the cold water tap and let the water run  for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any other cold water  faucets on that floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush any  taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.              If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water .    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.    Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.       Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner           Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

I want to be certain you are well  informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you have any  questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing a new sewer main in S. Indiana Avenue, from E.  Garfield Boulevard to E. 57th Street. The old pipe dates back to 1889 and needs to  be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Cochran’s office, and he has made clear we  are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Willie Cochran        20th Ward                                                      INDIANA SEWER PROJECT   HISTORY        Do you wonder what was happening in 1889?  That’s the year the old sewer was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:     Hull House              Hull House was opened by Miss Jane Addams at 800 S. Halsted, helping hundreds of   Chicago immigrants gain a place of self-respect in society.     The first train load of fruit, oranges, left Los Angeles for the east coast.    Benjamin Harrison won the American presidency despite Grover Cleveland’s larger   share of the popular vote.      The first concrete reinforced bridge was built.    The Chicago Auditorium opened. President Harrison made a visit.    Charlie Chaplin was born.    Bayer introduced aspirin in powder form, in Germany.    The first jukeboxes were placed in bars and arcades.    The Wall Street Journal began publication.    The Oklahoma land rush officially started.         INDIANA SEWER         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will be installing a new sewer main in S.  Indiana Avenue, from E. Garfield Boulevard to E. 57th Street.       Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1889 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by  Garfield Boulevard on the north, 59th Street on the south, Prairie Avenue on the east and  Michigan Avenue on the west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of  flooding.      Timing:  Work will begin shortly, with completion anticipated for late November. This  includes restoration of the damaged streets/parkways. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: Our excavation and the equipment involved all take up space, and safety, of course, is  the foremost consideration.  We may have some closures to “through traffic”. You will always  have access to your property.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1            ALDERMAN WILLIE COCHRAN   773-955-5610            ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         INDIANA SEWER PROJECT    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it  is.  Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of  digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will  pave the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and  curb at least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City  of Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce  the risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are  aware that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Cochran,  and others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.

Ternand, Star   No. 2717, arising out of the investigation of Complaint Register No. 1058279 (“Request for   Review”).     The Chief Administrator recommended that the following allegations against Officer   Ternand be Sustained:   Allegation No. 1: On November 8, 2012, at or about 6727 South Indiana Avenue, Chicago,  Officer Brandon Ternand used an unreasonable and excessive amount of force when he shot  Mr. Dakota Bright.     Allegation No. 2: On November 8, 2012, at or about 6727 South Indiana Avenue, Chicago,  Officer Brandon Ternand used deadly force against Mr. Dakota Bright which was  unprovoked and unwarranted.     The Chief Administrator recommended that Officer Ternand be discharged from the Chicago   Police Department.    The Superintendent objected to the Chief Administrator’s recommendation. The   Superintendent did not concur with the Chief Administrator’s recommended findings or penalty,   stating that based on all the evidence presented in this case, it is clear that Officer Ternand’s   actions were justified.        No. 17 RR 07  Police Officer Brandon R. Ternand  Request for Review and Opinion              According to the Certificate of Meeting and of Service submitted by the Chief   Administrator: (1) the Chief Administrator met with the Superintendent and/or his designees and   discussed this matter on October 17, 2017; and (2) the Request for Review was sent via email to   the Executive Director of the Police Board on October 18, 2017.      The Executive Director of the Police Board prepared and forwarded the Request for   Review file to Steve Flores, the member of the Police Board who was selected on a random   basis, pursuant to Article VI of the Police Board’s Rules of Procedure (“Reviewing Member”).    The Reviewing Member considered the Request for Review pursuant to Section 2-78-130(a)(iii)   of the Municipal Code of Chicago and Article VI of the Police Board’s Rules of Procedure.              OPINION   In the opinion of the Reviewing Member, the objections raised in the response of the   Superintendent of Police are not sufficient to meet the burden of overcoming the Chief   Administrator’s recommendation for discipline. Based on the facts and circumstances of this   matter, an evidentiary hearing before the Police Board is necessary to determine whether Officer   Ternand violated any of the Police Department’s Rules of Conduct.      Therefore, pursuant to Section 2-78-130(a)(iii) of the Municipal Code of Chicago, the   Chief Administrator’s recommendation for discipline of Police Officer Brandon R.

Go to  the right website  https://webapps.cityofchicago.org/EDSWeb      This link  must be typed  with  the  right  capitalization.   If this link  doesn't  work  for you,  please go to the City of Chicago  website  at   www.cityofchicago.org and in the search bar found  in the upper  right-hand  corner type  in ""EDS"". Click on the  first  search result  and scroll to  bottom of the page to the  button that  says ""Get Started On-Line"". Click on that  button......  and bookmark  the  page (add it to your  favorites).   2. Register for  the  EDS System  If you have never filled  out an on-line  EDS with  the city you can start  the registration process by clicking on ""Vendor  Registration""  found  on the left  hand side column. If someone from  your organization  has already registered, you will be  linked to the  existing application  during this registration  process. If you are the  first person to  register for your organization,  please, please, please  be sure to type  in the  exact legal name of your organization  and enter the correct  FEIN number.  After  you fill  out the vendor  registration,  an account will  be generated  for your organization  and you will be sent an e-mail with  a  link, user ID and a password that  will  allow  you to  log into  the  EDS system.  If you get a message that  your account requires  approval by the  EDS captain, see that  person.  Both of you should read the ""Registration""  guide after clicking ""Online EDS  manuals.""   3. Login  Return to  https://webapps.cityofchicago.org/EDSWeb   In the  upper  right  hand corner  of this page, there  is the  word  ""login"".  When/if you have a login name/password- you will  click on this to  login.   4. Fill out  an EDS for  a contract  If you have already  completed  your  EDS template and are bidding  on a new contract  or have been awarded  a contract, you  will need to  fill  out  an EDS for  a contract. For every contract with its own  PO, you will need to complete  a NEW EDS. I cannot  emphasize this enough. To do this, click on ""create  new""  again but this time  indicate  that  this is for  a contract  and complete  the  questions accordingly.  Most  questions will  be pre-populated with  the answers from  your template.  If your organization  has multiple tiers  of ownership, legal entity  owners  who  own more than 7.5% of your organization  will be required  to  fill  out  their  own EDS. Please  see the  help manuals and/or  videos for assistance if this is the case.   5. Print and submit your  Certificate of Filing  After  you electronically sign your EDS for  a contract, click ""View  Certificate""  to  view and print your Certificate  of Filing.  Include  the Certificate  of Filing with  the  contract  materials  you return  to the City.  If you need to  reprint a certificate  later,  you can click ""Recently  Submitted"", find the  appropriate EDS, and click the  ""P"" button.   Helpful Hints:   The Online EDS has a great library  of documents  and videos to  help you troubleshoot common  questions. You can access  them  on the left  hand side column.   If you still have questions  after  reading the  instruction manuals and/or  viewing  the help videos, please contact  your  contracts  person.

In late June, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 1,148 feet of  new 8-inch water main in N. Whipple Street (Diversey-Logan Boulevard).  The old water main  dates back to 1891, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    32nd Ward Office: 773-248-1330    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Commissioner of Water Management     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.
