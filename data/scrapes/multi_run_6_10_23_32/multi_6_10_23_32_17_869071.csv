This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,109 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Dickens Avenue, from  N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Spaulding Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1893 and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Maldonado’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       MAE WEST                          The World’s Columbian Exposition opened in Chicago.    Henry Perky and William Ford patented shredded wheat.    The first bowling magazine, which was called Gut Holz, was published.    France issued the first driver’s licenses, which included a required test.    Katharine Lee Bates wrote ""America the Beautiful,"" in Colorado.    Lizzie Borden was acquitted in the murder of her parents in New Bedford,   Massachusetts.     New Zealand became the first country to grant all its women the right to vote.    Actress Mae West was born.             DICKENS AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,109 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Dickens Avenue, from N. Hamlin Avenue to N. Spaulding Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1893 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by late January 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Dickens Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      ALDERMAN ROBERTO MALDONADO   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   3-1-1   773-395-0143   312-742-1021                                                    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  January 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!            "

Daley, Mayor   What is the risk?             January 15, 2010   Chicago Department of Public Health  Bechara Choucair, MD, Commissioner   As of January 15, 2010, the risk of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) influenza infection in Chicago continues to be  low. The numbers of severe influenza infections, influenza-like illnesses, and positive influenza tests have all de- creased.  Due to the possibility of a recurrence of heightened activity in the coming months, all Chicagoans aged  six months and older are encouraged to protect themselves from infection by getting vaccinated with the pandemic  influenza vaccine. Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  For  those without a healthcare provider or whose healthcare providers do not have the pandemic vaccine, a schedule of  City of Chicago pandemic vaccine clinics1 is available on the City website and by calling 311.   Figure 1. Reported number of hospitalizations associated with  confirmed or presumptive pandemic influenza A (H1N1), Chicago,  by week of specimen collection, April 2009 - January 9, 2010    Figure 2. Percent of patient visits to enrolled doctor’s offices  attributed to influenza-like illness, Chicago, by week, for current  season (2009-10) and previous two seasons, October-May     Are severe cases of influenza occurring?       Three confirmed or presumptive pandemic   influenza A (H1N1)-associated hospitalizations in  Chicago residents have been reported for surveil- lance week 1 (January 3 –  9, 2010). This is a 98%  decrease from the highest reported weekly count of  the fall, reported in early November, and represents  the ninth consecutive week that a decline has been  noted (figure 1).          How much influenza-like illness is occurring?       With 14 Chicago hospitals reporting, 5.0% of       emergency department visits were due to influenza- like illness (i.e. fever of 100°F or greater, with  cough or sore throat).  This represents the lowest  activity level reported since early October and a  41% decrease from the previous surveillance  week.  Among five outpatient clinics reporting for  the week of January 3 –  9, 2010, 3.2% of doctor’s  office visits were due to influenza-like illness.   This level of activity is similar to levels seen dur- ing the same surveillance week during previous  influenza seasons (figure 2).       Which influenza strains are circulating?   For the week of January 3 –  9, 2010, with six  laboratories reporting, all 9 influenza A-positive  specimens for which subtyping was performed  were reported as confirmed or presumptive pan- demic influenza A (H1N1); one influenza B strain  was also reported.          Where can I get more information?                                                                                                                   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  FluView2 report provides national updates and trends related to the intensity of influenza activity across the United  States, as well as detailed information on antiviral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics.

As  we  all  know  by  now,  we  are,  as  City  government  personnel,  subject  to  rules  and  restrictions on what gifts we can receive, whether  during the end-of-year holidays or any other time.        This  brief  guide  explains  the  rules.    Please  follow  them.    Violations  of  these  rules  could  lead  to  employment sanctions, removal from office, and/or fines, and public shaming.  No gift is worth that.    Remember also to check your own department’s or office’s gift rules, as they may be stricter than  those in the City’s Ethics Ordinance. Ask your departmental ethics officer about that.        THE GIFT RULES:     ○ You can’t solicit or accept any cash or gift card in any amount, unless it falls into one of the limited  exceptions listed below.  ○ You can’t solicit or accept any single non-cash, non-gift card gift, or combination of gifts, worth  more  than  $50  from  a  single  source  in  a  calendar  year,  unless  it  falls  into  one  of  the  limited  exceptions below.  ○ You can’t accept any anonymous gift, unless it falls into one of the limited exceptions below.  ○ You can’t solicit or accept  anything based on an understanding that your City decisions, actions or  judgments will be affected by it—no exceptions.  ○  You  can’t  accept  a  complimentary  invitation  for  a  vendor’s  holiday  party  unless  you  and  your  department head believe that your attendance is related to your City responsibilities, and you report  it to the Board of Ethics within 10 days. You can, of course, pay your own way.  We recommend that  you do. You are not prohibited from socializing with vendors or others!  ○  These  rules  also  apply  to  gifts  offered  to  or  accepted  by  your  spouse  or  domestic  partner,  and  immediate family members living in the same residence as you.     THE LIMITED EXCEPTIONS:   You may solicit or accept:    ● Gifts from your relatives, including cash or gift cards, in any amount;  ● Gifts from a personal friend, unless you have reason to believe that your friend offered you the  gifts because of your City position (we advise that “business friends” are not personal friends – a  personal friend is someone you know independently of your City position);    ● Anything for which you pay fair market value;  ● Anything offered to members of the public on the same terms, like sales promotions or discount  tickets;  ● Gifts you accept on the City's behalf, as long as they’re reported to the Board and City Comptroller  (but  they  must  be  useable  for  City  business  purposes  or  displayed  or  put  out  for  the  public’s  enjoyment – candy or Poinsettias qualify); and  ●  Gifts  offered  to  you  because  of  your  outside,  non-City  business,  employment,  or  community  activity.   GIFTS FROM OTHER CITY PERSONNEL, OFFICE PARTIES     ► City employees may give any gift to co-worker(s) at their level or at a lower pay rate.  ► However, they may not give their official superior(s) any holiday gift other than a non-cash item  or gift card worth $10 or less (even if their superior makes less money).  ► City employees may not solicit co-workers for a gift to any official superior.  ►  Gifts for  “white  elephant,”  “Secret  Santa,” or  grab-bag  parties  must  be worth  $10  or  less,  and  cannot be cash in any amount.  ► No official superior may ever coerce his or her subordinates into giving or contributing to a gift.  ► For in-office holiday parties, employees may contribute any amount toward food or drinks to be  shared in the office among co-workers.    “Official superior” means any other City employee(s), including your immediate supervisor(s), whose  official responsibilities include directing or evaluating your performance—and the Mayor himself.    NOTE: You won’t violate the law if you promptly take reasonable action to return a prohibited gift or  transfer any tangible or perishable gift to a tax-exempt charity.    The Board of Ethics will help you figure out whether a gift or specific party plan is acceptable. Please  call us in advance for confidential advice or guidance.  There’s no such thing as a silly question.    Remember: Before accepting any gift, always consider not only whether the law allows you to keep  it,  but  whether  your  acceptance  may  create  the  perception  that  your  independent  judgment  or  integrity could be compromised. When in doubt, just say “no thanks.”                               RAHM EMANUEL, MAYOR  WILLIAM F.

By mid October 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 3,425 feet of new 8-inch water main in W. Cermak  Road, from S. Millard Avenue to S. Drake Avenue and S. Central Park Avenue, from W. Cermak Road  to W. 26th Street. The old water main dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  24th Ward Office:773-533-2400  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635        Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.   Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016
