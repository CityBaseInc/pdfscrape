In late January, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 1,265 feet of  new 8-inch water main in W. 31st Street (Stewart-Wentworth). The old water main dates back to  1900, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    11th Ward Office: 773-254-6677    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

Also, be aware of Mobile Food Vehicle (MFV) license operational provisions*: •	 MFVs may operate from a legal street parking space, and in designated Food Stands, not to exceed a   2-hour service limit.  •	 MFVs may operate on private property, not to exceed service limits of two hours, as long as the property   meets the applicable Zoning requirements, and the property owner provides written permission.            Also be aware of any insurance requirements that property owners may require from food trucks or event organizers.  •	 No MFV may park or stand within 200 feet of any principal customer entrance to a restaurant which is   located on the street level with the exception of 12 AM – 2AM.  •	 MFVs are not allowed on privately-owned vacant lots, or a lot of a vacant building. •	 Except at designated Food Stands, MFVs are not allowed in the restricted parking area bounded by the   Chicago River, Michigan Avenue and Harrison Street.  •	 Mobile food vending is prohibited in the Medical Center District.  If your proposed food truck fest location does not meet the MFV license operational provisions, please contact the  Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) to find out if your event qualifies under the Special Events  Permit operational provisions (see section on Special Events Permits below).  OBTAIN A SPECIAL EVENTS PERMIT (IF APPLICABLE)  A Special Event Permit may be obtained to host a food truck event. The Department of Cultural Affairs  and Special Events (DCASE) issues Special Event Permits. The Permit Package Application may be found in  DCASE’s Chicago Neighborhood Festivals web page. If the location of your fest falls within 200 feet of an  entrance to restaurant and/or the event will exceed the two hour service limit, you may apply for a Special  Event Permitted and these restrictions do not apply.   Also, please be aware that the licensed food truck participants of your event must complete the Special Event  Food Truck License Application portion of the Special Event Permit Application and pay the appropriate fee  to participate in a food truck fest permitted by DCASE.   INVITE LICENSED FOOD TRUCKS  The second ingredient to ensuring a successful food truck fest is inviting licensed food trucks. Food trucks must have  either a Mobile Food Dispenser (MFD) or Mobile Food Preparer (MFP) License to operate at your event in Chicago.  More information about food truck licensing may be found in BACP’s Mobile Food Vendor Licenses web page.  To search for licensed food trucks, access the City’s Data Portal at data.cityofchicago.org and type Business License  - Current Active in the search field to access Chicago’s dataset of all current business licenses. Set the license  description filter to Mobile Food License. All of Chicago’s currently licensed MFD and MFP’s will appear. A majority of  food trucks are on social media and have websites. Use this list to contact and invite only those who are licensed by  the City of Chicago.  PROMOTE YOUR EVENT  Food trucks and their followers are avid social media users. Create marketing materials and promote the event  early and often on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. Devise a customized, catchy hashtag  (e.g., #ChiFoodTruckFest) to generate a following. Tag food trucks attending your event to promote amongst  their followers and beyond. And always tag @ChicagoBACP - we’re on the look out to support the next local  food truck fest!  QUESTIONS? CONTACT US AT 312-74-GOBIZ  CITY OF CHICAGO • DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND CONSUMER PROTECTION*City Council may from time to time define areas, in the interest of preserving public health and safety or avoiding traffic congestion, in which no mobile food vendor may prepare or dispense food from a wheeled vehicle.  The City Clerk shall maintain for public inspection and copying a file of all ordinances defining such areas.

Background   Snow cover refers to the amount of land covered by snow at any given time. Naturally, it is influenced  by the amount of precipitation that falls as snow. Air temperature also plays a role because it  determines whether precipitation falls as snow or rain, and it affects the rate at which snow on the  ground melts. As temperature and precipitation patterns change, so can the overall area covered by  snow.   Snow cover is not just something that is affected by climate change; it also exerts an influence on  climate. Because snow is white, it absorbs only a small portion of the sunlight that hits it (10 to 20  percent in the case of fresh snow), and it reflects the rest back to space. In contrast, darker surfaces  such as bare ground and open water absorb the majority of the energy they receive and heat up more  quickly. In this way, the overall amount of snow cover affects patterns of heating and cooling over the  Earth’s surface. More snow means more energy reflects back to space, resulting in cooling, while less  snow cover means more energy is absorbed at the Earth’s surface, resulting in warming.   On a more local scale, snow cover is important for many plants and animals. For example, some plants  and animals rely on a protective blanket of snow to insulate them from sub-freezing winter  temperatures. Humans and ecosystems also rely on snowmelt to replenish streams and groundwater.  Snow cover also keeps the soil moist, so if the snow melts away earlier in the spring, the soil may dry out  sooner, which can stress plants and increase the risk of wildfire.1   About the Indicator   This indicator tracks the area covered by snow since 1972, based on maps generated by analyzing  satellite images collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figure 1 was created  by analyzing weekly maps to determine the total extent of snow cover, then averaging the weekly  observations together to get a value for each year. Figure 2 uses the same method, but with average  snow cover calculated for each season: spring (defined as March–May), summer (June–August), fall  (September–November), and winter (December–February). These two figures cover all of North  America, not including Greenland. Figure 3 focuses on the contiguous 48 states plus Alaska. It shows the  average date when snow first starts to cover the ground in the fall, the average last date of snow cover  in the spring, and the length of time between them. These snow cover season dates have been averaged  over all parts of the country that regularly receive snow.    Key Points   •  When averaged over the entire year, snow covered an average of 3.24 million square miles of   North America during the period from 1972 to 2015 (see Figure 1).      1   Climate Change Indicators in the United States: Snow Cover   www.epa.gov/climate-indicators - Updated August 2016     •  The extent of snow cover has varied from year to year. The average area covered by snow has  ranged from 3.0 million to 3.6 million square miles, with the minimum value occurring in 1998  and the maximum in 1978 (see Figure 1).   •  Between 1972 and 2015, the average extent of North American snow cover decreased at a rate  of about 3,300 square miles per year. The average area covered by snow during the most recent  decade (2006–2015) was 3.21 million square miles, which is about 4 percent smaller than the  average extent during the first 10 years of measurement (1972–1981)—a difference of 122,000  square miles, or approximately an area the size of New Mexico (see Figure 1).   •  Decreases in snow cover have largely occurred in spring and summer, whereas fall and winter  snow cover have remained fairly steady over the time period studied (see Figure 2). Spring and  summer snow cover can have a particularly important influence on water supplies.   •  Since 1972, the U.S. snow cover season has become shorter by nearly two weeks, on average   (see Figure 3). By far the largest change has taken place in the spring, with the last day of snow  shifting earlier by 19 days since 1972. In contrast, the first date of snow cover in the fall has  remained relatively unchanged.   2         Climate Change Indicators in the United States: Snow Cover   www.epa.gov/climate-indicators - Updated August 2016       Figure 1.

Data source: NOAA, 20154      Indicator Notes   Although satellite-based snow cover maps are available starting in the mid-1960s, some of the early  years are missing data from several weeks during the summer, which would lead to an inaccurate  annual average. Thus, the indicator is restricted to 1972 and later, with all years having a full set of data.

This suspension   is being reviewed by the Police Board pursuant to Section 9.6A of the Agreement between the   City of Chicago and the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #7, which states in relevant part “In the   event an officer does not make an election within ten (10) working days, the recommendation for   suspension will be reviewed by the Police Board.”    The Executive Director of the Police Board assigned this matter to Hearing Officer   Jacqueline A. Walker.  Hearing Officer Walker reviewed the investigation file and submitted a   written report to the Police Board.     Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2315  Police Officer Joseph Boston  Findings and Decision                 The members of the Police Board reviewed the Summary Report of the investigation file,   the Command Channel Review reports, and Hearing Officer Walker’s report.  Hearing Officer   Walker made an oral report to and conferred with the Police Board before it rendered its findings   and decision.       POLICE BOARD FINDINGS   The Police Board of the City of Chicago, as a result of its consideration of this matter,   finds and determines that:   1.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 1 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston did resist a lawful arrest by Officer Durkin and Officer Alaniz.     See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 2 below, which are incorporated here by   reference.      2.   The allegations, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 2 are supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegations are therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston brought discredit upon the Department in that he caused a disturbance when  he kicked the door of an apartment, banged on apartment doors, and rang doorbells.    On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston brought discredit upon the Department in that he resisted a lawful arrest by  refusing to follow Officers Durkin and Alaniz’s verbal direction, flailing his arms to defeat      2   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2315  Police Officer Joseph Boston  Findings and Decision                 the arrest, pulling away after Officer Durkin had one cuff on him, and refusing to place his  legs inside the squad car.    On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston brought discredit upon the Department in that he threatened Officer Durkin  during this arrest in that Officer Boston stated words to the effect of “If you want to fight I’ll  give you your money’s worth,” and “You’re on your status, I’ll call OPS and have your job.”   Officer Boston further stated words to the effect of, “You might as well turn in your badge   because you’re on your status, your career is over with, you’re a rookie, I’m gonna call OPS  on you,” and “I know people and it’ll get done.”               It was reported that on March 9, 2008, at about 04:55 a.m., Police Officers Elizabeth   Alaniz and Michael Durkin responded to a call of a disturbance at 4280 West Ford City Drive.    The officers reported that upon arriving at the scene, they saw Officer Boston trying to kick the   door at 4280 West Ford City Drive.  They reported that Officer Boston refused to comply with   the officers’ orders, and appeared to be intoxicated.  When the officers attempted to put Officer   Boston in handcuffs, he resisted their efforts to handcuff him.  They also reported that they were   finally successful in handcuffing Officer Boston.                          The Arrest Report and Case Report for Officer Boston indicated that Officer Boston was   arrested for Resisting/Obstructing a Peace Officer/Correctional Employee.      3.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 6 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston violated the provisions of General Order 07-01, Section III-C, when he was in  possession of a firearm while he was intoxicated.     One of the residents of the location of the incident, Josephine Johnson, provided a   statement during the investigation of the charges, in which she stated that while Officer Boston      3   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2315  Police Officer Joseph Boston  Findings and Decision    was in the hallway knocking on the door of Unit #303, she saw the holster of Officer Boston’s               gun in his waist.  Furthermore, there were several reports submitted that Officer Boston exhibited   signs of being highly intoxicated, in addition to a Breathalyzer test result of .153, some hours   after the incident that indicate Officer Boston was intoxicated while carrying his weapon in   violation of General Order 07-01, Section III-C.      4.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 9 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston engaged in an unjustified physical altercation by flailing his arms to defeat  the arrest, pulling away after Officer Durkin had one cuff on him, and refusing to place his  legs inside the squad car.     See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 2 above, which are incorporated here by   reference.      5.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 10 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0455 hours, at 4280 West Ford City Drive, Chicago,  Officer Boston failed to maintain control of his weapon, in that Police Officer Elizabeth  Alaniz recovered Officer Boston’s weapon from the floor of the 3rd floor hallway of 4280  West Ford City Drive.     Officers Alaniz and Durkin reported that while they struggled with Officer Boston in an   attempt to handcuff him, Officer Boston’s gun fell on the floor of the hallway at the location in   question.  Officer Alaniz then recovered Officer Boston’s weapon from the floor.      4   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2315  Police Officer Joseph Boston  Findings and Decision                 6.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476,   violated Rule 15 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On March 9, 2008, at approximately 0931 hours, while off duty, Officer Boston was  intoxicated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.153. A back extrapolation of Officer  Boston’s Breathalyzer test results revealed that at the time of the incident, on March 9, 2008,  at approximately 0455 hours, Officer Boston’s blood alcohol concentration was between  0.195 and 0.238.  Officer Boston also admitted that on March 9, 2008, he was intoxicated  and was driven home by his brother.     Lieutenant LaVoy reported that on the day in question, he observed Officer Boston, and   Officer Boston’s overall actions led Lieutenant LaVoy to conclude that Officer Boston was   intoxicated.  Lieutenant LaVoy also reported that he ordered Officer Boston to take a   Breathalyzer test, and the results indicated that Officer Boston had a blood-alcohol concentration   of .153 at 9:31 a.m.              There was also a report submitted by Sergeant Michael Murzyn, who responded to the   scene of the incident, following a request from Officers Durkin and Alaniz.  Sergeant Murzyn   reported that he entered the squad car where Officer Boston was being held to talk with Officer   Boston and smelled a very strong odor of alcohol on Officer Boston’s breath, Officer Boston’s   eyes were bloodshot and his speech was slurred.              Reports were obtained from Officers Durkin and Alaniz wherein they reiterated that   Officer Boston appeared to be intoxicated on the day in question.                 7.  The Police Board has considered the facts and circumstances of Officer Boston’s   conduct, and his complimentary and disciplinary histories.  Officer Boston, while off duty, was   intoxicated while possessing his gun, threatened and resisted responding officers, and failed to      5   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2315  Police Officer Joseph Boston  Findings and Decision    maintain control of his weapon.  Officer Boston’s reckless and dangerous actions are serious               offenses, and the thirty-day suspension ordered in this case is not unwarranted.            POLICE BOARD DECISION      The Police Board of the City of Chicago hereby adopts the findings set forth herein by   the following votes:      By votes of 9 in favor (Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William F.  Conlon, Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D.  Sweeney) to 0 opposed, the Board sustains the allegations that Police Officer Joseph Boston  violated Rule 1, Rule 2, Rule 6, Rule 9, Rule 10, and Rule 15.     As a result of the foregoing, the Board, by a vote of 9 in favor (Carney, Foreman, Ballate,   Conlon, Eaddy, Fry, McKeever, Rodriguez, and Sweeney) to 0 opposed, hereby determines that   cause exists for suspending Police Officer Joseph Boston from his position as a police officer   with the Department of Police, and from the services of the City of Chicago, for a period of thirty   (30) days.   NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the suspension of Police   Officer Joseph Boston, Star No. 13476, for a period of thirty (30) days is sustained.    This disciplinary action is adopted and entered by a majority of the members of the   Police Board: Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William F. Conlon,   Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D. Sweeney.

Each tanning facility shall post a sign indicating: “The City of Chicago prohibits anyone less than 18   years of age from using tanning equipment, such as tanning beds, tanning booths or other  equipment that uses ultraviolet light to tan.” This sign shall be 8 ½ inches high by 11 inches wide and  the lettering 30 point bold font.

In May, Department of Water Management crews will begin work to install a new sewer  main in S. Hoyne Avenue (71st Place-72nd Street), in W. 71st Street (Hoyne-300’ west), in W.  71st Place (Hoyne-300’ west), in W. 72nd Street (Hoyne-300’ west), in W. 72nd Place (Hoyne- 300’ west), and in S. Hoyne Avenue (73rd Street-72nd Place). The old sewer dates back to  1900 and needs to be replaced.     This project will require the full continuous closure of 71st Street between Hoyne and  Bell for approximately one week while we replace the existing sewer. Traffic will be  detoured via Damen - 69th Street - Western. Otherwise, when we are working in the street,  we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always be able to reach your home  or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    17th Ward Office: 773-783-3672    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner
