After  reviewing  relevant  law  and  after  conferring  with  the Department  of  General  Services  (DGS),  the  Board  has  determined  that  the Governmental Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit you from purchasing a City-owned lot under ANLAP.   FACTS:    The facts upon which our opinion is based come from your letter, staff conversations with you, our review of ANLAP’s enabling ordinance, and consultation with the Department of General Services.   ANLAP is administered by DGS.  Under the enabling Ordinance which established this program, homeowners in certain areas of the City may purchase City-owned vacant  lots  for  less  than  market  value.    In  order  to  qualify  for  ANLAP,  the prospective buyer must own and occupy the property immediately adjacent to the vacant lot; the vacant lot must be zoned residential; the appraised fair market value of the vacant lot must not exceed $10,000; and the prospective buyer must not be delinquent in the payment of real estate taxes or have any outstanding debt with the City of Chicago.  The minimum bid for purchase of property under this program is $300.00.  Upon receipt of a bid for property under ANLAP, DGS sends notice by regular and certified mail to the owners of the other properties adjacent to the lot in question,  informing  the  owners  of  the  bid,  without  revealing  the  amount,  and providing them with an opportunity to submit a sealed bid for the parcel for a period of thirty days from the date of the mailing of the notice.  The bids are then opened by the Department at a public meeting convened before a certified court reporter. All bids which conform to the requirements of ANLAP are then referred to the City Council committee having jurisdiction over the disposition of City-owned real estate, which then holds a public hearing.  The City Council may accept the higher bid by a majority vote, or may reject both bids by a vote of three-quarters of its members.   You state that you have already submitted a minimum bid of $300.00 to purchase the lot  at  [1234  Avenue].    DGS  has  informed  Board  staff  that  you  meet  all  the requirements for submitting this bid under ANLAP.  The Department also states that it sent notice to the owner of the other adjacent property ([1235 Avenue]) informing him of your bid and that this letter was returned as undeliverable.  The Department of  General  Services  confirmed  that  it  has  concluded  the  owner  of  the  adjacent property is not the occupier of the property, and is therefore not qualified to bid under ANLAP.  The Department also reports that the lot has an appraised value of “over $5,000.00.”  Finally, you have stated that as an employee of the Department  Case No. 00010.A June 14, 2000 Page 2   of [          Y                ], you do not participate in the making of any decisions concerning ANLAP, nor do you have occasion to be involved in any aspect of the ANLAP program.   LAW:      The  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  provision  most  relevant  to    your  case  is  Sec.  2-156-110 (Interest in City Business). This provision states that:   ...Unless sold pursuant to a process of competitive bidding following public notice, no elected official or employee shall have a financial interest in the purchase of any property that (i) belongs to the City, or (ii) is sold for taxes or assessments, or (iii) is sold by virtue of legal process at the suit of the City.    Sec. 2-156-010(l) of the Ordinance defines “financial interest,” in relevant part, as any interest with a cost or present value of $5,000.00 or more.  ANALYSIS:     Under these provisions, then, City employees are prohibited from having a financial interest in the purchase of City property unless it is sold through a process of competitive bidding after public notice has been given.  Assuming for purposes of this opinion that the reported assessed property value of “over $5,000.00"" is its “present value” within the meaning of Section 2-156-010(l), your purchase of the property would be prohibited under Section 2-156-110, unless sold pursuant to public notice and competitive bidding.1  It is the Board’s opinion that the property sold through the ANLAP procedures described above meet both these requirements of the Ordinance.  Under ANLAP, city-owned vacant lots may only be purchased by the owner/occupier of the adjacent property–in this case, yourself and an owner/occupier of [1235 Avenue]. Therefore, public notice of the opportunity to purchase the vacant lot need only be given to those individuals who meet the requirements under ANLAP.  The public notice requirement of the Ordinance was fulfilled when the Department of General Services sent the owner of the [1235 Avenue] property a letter informing him of your bid.  At that point, the process of competitive bidding also began, as this individual, if qualified, could have also bid for the property.   The fact that this individual was not qualified to bid is no more relevant that if he had been qualified to bid, but chose not to.   The Board concludes that the [1234 Avenue] property is being sold pursuant to a process of competitive bidding following public notice, and that City employees are not prohibited from purchasing such property under Sec. 2-156-110.  Finally, although you have stated that as an employee of the Department of [            Y         ], you have no occasion to be involved in any aspect of the ANLAP program, we caution you that under Sections 2-156- 030(a) and 080(a), you would be prohibited from making, participating in making, or using your position with the City to influence any City decision or action relating to your purchase of the lot in question.    DETERMINATIONS:     The Board determines that the Governmental Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit  1The Board is not concluding or determining that a property’s “assessed value” is its “present  value” for purposes of interpreting Sec. 2-156-010(l) and -110.    Case No. 00010.A June 14, 2000 Page 3  your purchase of the [1234 Avenue] property under the ANLAP program.

By late November 2015, the Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark  Construction Company crews will begin the work to install 2,375 feet of new 8-inch water  main in S. Yates Boulevard, from 190’ south of E. 79th Street to 117’ north of E. 83rd Street.  The old water main dates back to 1896, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to www.buildinganewchicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply  enter your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this  letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:     •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  7th Ward Office: 773-731-7777  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for several  minutes.  The aerator screens located at the tip of your faucets should be removed prior to  flushing.    This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, or any  particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line as a result of  the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.

Malcolm X College is located just  south of the United Center, which is  home of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago  Blackhawks.  The areas north and  west of the United Center are primar- ily residential, and include two large  redevelopment sites on former CHA  land.  Jackson Square at West End will  ultimately replace the former Rockwell  Gardens/Maplewood Courts high-ris- es with mixed income housing, while  the West Haven community will do  the same at the former Henry Horner  Homes site.     The Near West Planning Area is served  by ten CTA and two Metra stations.   Eighteen parks offer open space for the  public, and residents are served by two  public libraries.  There are a plethora of  health service providers, including Rush  University Medical Center, Stroger  Hospital of Cook County, the University  of Illinois Hospital, Mile Square Health  Center, and Near West Family Health  Center, among others.  Leadership for  the area is provided by a number of  business and resident organizations,  such as the Near West CDC, Connect- ing4Communities and the Industrial  Council of Nearwest Chicago, among  many others.      NEAR WEST  HISTORY AND  COMMUNITY  ASSETS  The Near West Planning Area is unique  among Chicago’s16 Planning Areas in  that it fits within a single community  area, yet this small section of the city is  packed with a diverse mix of residents,  institutions, manufacturers, offices,  and entertainment.  With over 116,000  area jobs, the Near West is one of only  two planning areas - the Central Plan- ning Area being the other - with more  jobs than residents.  After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,  over 200,000 Chicagoans relocated to  the area, creating teeming neighbor- hoods largely based on ethnicity.  Hull  House was founded by Jane Addams  and Ellen Gates in 1889 to serve these  immigrant populations.  The Great  Migration brought African Americans to  the area, especially during the 1940s  and 1950s,  a period which coincided  with the development of dense public  housing.  The construction of large de- velopment projects, such as the Circle  Interchange, the University of Illinois  at Chicago, the Illinois Medical District,  and the United Center - along with the  much later demolition of public housing  towers - displaced huge numbers of  residents.     Today, the Near West Planning Area  is one of the fastest growing areas  of the city for residents, visitors, and  businesses, benefitting from close  proximity to Chicago’s downtown  business district and from the city’s  transportation network.  The Near   West is bisected by the Eisenhower  Expressway (I-290) running east-west  and by Ashland Ave running north- south down the middle of the area.  The northeast quarter of the area  is facing significant development  pressure for new housing and offices,  while it remains home to over 2,000  businesses in the Kinzie Industrial  Corridor and a major wholesale food  distribution center around Fulton  Market.  Greektown, Randolph Street,  and Madison Street are well known for  their excellent restaurants that attract  patrons from all over the world.    The southeast quarter of the Near  West is dominated by the east and  south campuses of the University of  Illinois at Chicago, the adjoining Uni- versity Village residential development,  and by the Roosevelt Square develop- ment of the Chicago Housing Author- ity’s former ABLA (Addams Brooks  Loomis Abbott) Homes site.  Little  Italy runs through this section along W  Taylor St, while S Halsted St has been  redeveloped along with University Vil- lage as a neighborhood scale shopping  district south of Roosevelt Rd.  The southwest quarter of the Near  West is dominated by the Illinois Med- ical District (IMD), which includes UIC’s  West Campus, Rush University Medical  Center, Stroger Hospital of Cook Coun- ty, Jesse Brown Veteran’s Administra- tion Medical Center, the Cook County  Medical Examiner’s Office, the FBI  Crime Lab, the American Red Cross,  and the Chicago Technology Park.

The Near  West is one of the most racially and  ethnically mixed areas of the city,  with roughly similar white (42%) and  African-American (32%) populations  plus the city’s second-largest Asian  population.  The Near West popu- lation is also economically mixed,  with 39% of its households earning  less than $50,000 per year and  33% of its households earning more  than $100,000 per year.  The area’s  unemployment rate was less than  the city average in 2012 (the latest  year for which planning area-level  data is available): 10.7% vs. 12.9%.   Unemployment has dropped signifi- cantly since then, and this data will  be updated in future iterations of this  Action Plan.

This would  suggest that many consumers visit  the Near West to purchase goods and  services in the food and beverage,  personal care, and eating and drinking  categories.  And they do:  the Near  West is home to the famed Randolph  Street restaurants, the rapidly growing  Fulton Market Area, Greek Town, Little  Italy, and the United Center.  However,  in other categories such as general  merchandise and auto sales and  services, Near West Planning Area  residents would be expected to spend  over $160 million more per year on  these items than the actual area-wide  sales in these two categories.  While  auto sales face some factors that limit  expansion possibilities, such as existing  agreements with dealers, the general  merchandise category may  present an  expansion opportunity for retailers.  Vacancy rates in the Near West Plan- ning Area declined for industrial, office,  and retail space during the eight years  between 2005 and 2013, and anec- dotal evidence suggests that space has  tightened even further over the past  year.  The vacancy rates for industrial /  flex space and office are far below the  city average, while retail vacancies are  around two percentage points higher  than the city as a whole.

The Near West  Planning Area has a lower proportion  of vacant homes than its share of the  city’s housing stock would suggest,  and far fewer homes have gone  through a recent foreclosure than the  city average.

However, they have access  to significantly less acreage per  resident than the City’s goal, which is  5 acres per 1000 residents.  With only  1.2 acres of open space per 1,000  residents, this area has the second  lowest ratio of space to population of  Chicago’s 16 Planning Areas.  Two-thirds of the Near West  Planning Area residents live within a  half-mile from a rail station - nearly  twice as high as the citywide average,  and the third highest ratio among the  16 Planning Areas - yet commuting  by rail is no higher than the citywide  average and 41% of the residents  drive alone in a shorter-than-average  commute.   With over 30 DIVVY bike stations  in the area, biking is the preferred  transportation mode of 2.5% of  commuters, twice the city average.

NEAR WEST  EXISTING LAND  USE & RECENT  INVESTMENTS EXISTING LAND USE  Land uses in the Near West Planning  Area are far more evenly mixed than  most other areas of the city.  Much of  the land is owned by a large number of  institutional users dedicated to educa- tion, health care, and entertainment.  In  fact, half of the area’s land is occupied  by commercial, industrial, and public/ institutional uses, which is nearly dou- ble the city’s average usage for these  combined categories.   Not surprisingly, less land is dedicated  to housing and open space than the  city averages, while the presence of the  University of Illinois at Chicago and the  Illinois Medical district mean that far  more land than usual is dedicated to  public institutions.  The Kinzie Corridor  supports very productive manufac- turing uses on the northern end of the  planning area.  However, 10% of land  within the Near West Planning Area  remains vacant, which is higher than  the citywide average.  RECENT INVESTMENTS In recent years, a number of invest- ments have enhanced the built envi- ronment in Near West Planning Area,  including:  •  Morgan Street CTA Station at W   Lake St and N Morgan St.  Chicago’s  first new station in almost two  decades serves the Pink and Green  lines.

This Action Plan  will build upon the work that has al- ready been undertaken.  At least three  plans have been completed since 2000  that generated recommendations to  improve the Near West Planning Area,  one of which was approved by the  Chicago Planning Commission.

Some examples include:  •   •   From “Reconnecting Neigh- borhoods,” improve wayfinding  signage from the CTA Medical  District Blue Line station to the  United Center (Priority Project  #11)  From the “Near West Side Land  Use Plan,” prioritize industrial and  service companies to ensure that  they continue to provide jobs (Pri- ority Projects #1, #2 and #3)  •   Also from the “Near West Side  Land Use Plan,” develop neighbor-  21  3 CONTEXTFIRST DRAFT - FOR DISCUSSION

This is part of  our approach to renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to  partner with you our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are  well informed about the project. You should know where to call if you have any  questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,345 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Mobile Avenue,  from W. 51st Street to W. 52nd Street, and in S. Mulligan Avenue, from W. 51st Street to  W. 52nd Street. The old pipe dates back to 1922, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Zalewski’s office, and he has made clear we are to  put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood  through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the  project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct  ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program  and our Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

Mobile Avenue, from W. 51st Street to W. 52nd Street, and in S.  Mulligan Avenue, from W. 51st Street to W. 52nd Street.       Reason:  The old main dates back to 1922 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late July 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Mobile and Mulligan outside of our working  hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a  metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic  only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours.  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we  can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If  you have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also  call Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the  voicemail message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside  of our working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the  workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the  services from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour  notice when this is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old  pipe will break.  They can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If  we do this, we will let you know what is happening, even though we may be unable to  give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be  good neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By  working together, we can complete this important project as friends working for the  improvement of our community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your  neighbors to reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective  response as the only strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood  basis to work with us on practical steps (public and private) to protect your  property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters  to monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for  only the water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while  protecting one of our most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This  means that with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their  water bills.      Homeowner Incentives         Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:   A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the   meter had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit  www.metersave.org, call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account  number ready.  Space is limited based on funding availability and the number of  volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter  complete with the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of  charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to  Water Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1   place inside the home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount  of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this  limited time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise,  Water Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the  sustainability of our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500  gallons per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household  water consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water  consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This  saves 25 gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers  typically use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in  the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use  by 20-50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use  thousands of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save  money and water by preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45  million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could  face severe water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the  Chicago Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water  from Lake Michigan.               Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!

By early April 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Joel Kennedy Constructing  Corp. crews will begin the work to install 5,067 feet of new 8-inch water main in N. Broadway,  from W. Thorndale Avenue to W. Foster Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1914, and needs  to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  47th Ward Office: 773-868-4747  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635                   Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.        If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.

By early January 2016, the Department of Water Management (DWM) and Joel Kennedy  Constructing Corp. crews will begin the work to install 602 feet of new 8-inch water main  and 2,978 feet of new 12-inch water main in N. Lincoln Avenue, from W. Lawrence Avenue  to W. Montrose Avenue and W. Wilson Avenue, from N. Lincoln Avenue to N. Leavitt Street.  The old water main dates back to 1892, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to www.buildinganewchicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply  enter your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this  letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:     •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  47th Ward Office: 773-868-4747  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for several  minutes.  The aerator screens located at the tip of your faucets should be removed prior to  flushing.    This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, or any  particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line as a result of  the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.     Sincerely,     Thomas Powers  Commissioner
