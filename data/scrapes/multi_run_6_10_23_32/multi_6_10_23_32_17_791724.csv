In August, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 2,306 feet of new  8-inch water main in W. Fillmore Street (Homan-Sacramento) and in S. Troy Street (Fillmore- Roosevelt). The old water main dates back to 1887, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    24th Ward Office: 773-533-2400    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner      Genwmnot03032016

In early June, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 675 feet of  new 8-inch water main in S. Karlov Avenue, from W. 32nd Street to W. 33rd Street.  The old water  main dates back to 1913, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    22nd Ward Office: 773-762-1771    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner      Genwmnot03032016
