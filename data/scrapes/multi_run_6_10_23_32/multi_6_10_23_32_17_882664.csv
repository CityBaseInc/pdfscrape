This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,284 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Buffalo Avenue, from  300’North of  E. 83rd Street to E. 86th   Street. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Pope’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:              CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.   •  The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.   •  W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.  •  •  Congress created the Weather Bureau.  •  Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.   •  X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.  •  Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.  •  The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.  •  Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                                                     24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      CONTACT NUMBERS   3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOHN POPE   773-721-1999   BUFFALO AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,284 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Buffalo Avenue, from 300’North of  E. 83rd Street to E. 86th   Street.    Reason:  The old main consist of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by mid September 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Buffalo Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS     What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid September  2013. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.   Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  These  screens should be removed prior to flushing.  This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement.  If you have any  questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.         DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

Use  this form to determine if your project must comply with the energy code and the Department of Building’s submittal requirements for a building  permit.  Compliance is required for new construction and/or if any of the building components below will be replaced, renovated or modified:      Exemptions:    Mechanical Systems & Equipment (HVAC)   Electrical Power and Lighting    Building Envelope     Service Water Heating             Portions of building that are not conditioned (heated or cooled)  Portions that are separated from the rest of the building by a building envelope assembly and which have a designed peak energy rate usage of less  than 3.4 Btu/h/ft2 (10.7 W/m2) or 1.0 watt/ft2  (W/m2).    Portions of the building that have received landmark designation (typically the envelope only). See 13(18-13-101.4.2) for specific details.   Existing buildings may continue to use and maintain lawfully-installed building systems that are in existence.      •  •   •  •     Step 2: Determine Occupancy Classification   For Chapter 18-13 Energy Conservations purposes, all buildings are classified as either Residential or Commercial.   Buildings that contain  both occupancies are considered Mixed Occupancy.   Residential  Occupancy:   Commercial  Occupancy:  Mixed  Occupancy:   All buildings up to and including four stories in height (above grade) containing any permanent residential occupancy are considered  residential.  Buildings that are up to and including four stories in height (above grade) and contain more than 15% of the building  area in an other occupancy are considered mixed occupancy.  All buildings containing occupancies other than a permanent residential occupancy, as well as all residential buildings that are five  stories or more above grade are considered commercial.    For buildings that contain both a permanent residential occupancy and a commercial occupancy which is more than 15% of the  building total area (as defined above), each occupancy shall conform to the requirements for that type of occupancy.        Use the check boxes below to determine the classification for the project.  YES       NO                           Is the building 5 stories or more above grade?

Is the building 4 stories or less above grade and contains any permanent residential occupancy, such as houses, apartments, condos, or       dorms (hotel and temporary housing units are not included here)?  (cid:131)   If you checked “YES”, please complete the Residential Compliance Form.                    Is the building 4 stories or less above grade and does it contain any permanent residential occupancy and any other occupancy which   occupies more than 15% of the total building area?

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,584 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Kenton Avenue, from W.  Addison Street to W. Roscoe Street, and in N. Kilbourn Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W.  Roscoe Street. The old pipe dates back to 1909, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Reboyras’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Ariel Reboyras               30th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                    Do you wonder what was happening in 1909?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:               ERROL FLYNN        The first U.S. university school of nursing was established, at the University of   Minnesota.     Joan of Arc was declared a saint.    The first Lincoln head pennies were minted.    The Indianapolis 500 race track opened.    Actor Errol Flynn was born.    Workers began pouring concrete for the Panama Canal.    The first subway car with side doors went into service in New York City.                       WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will install 2,584 feet of 8-inch water main in  N. Kenton Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W. Roscoe Street, and in N. Kilbourn Avenue,  from W. Addison Street to W. Roscoe Street.     Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We expect our work to start shortly, and be completed in late April. Final restoration  will follow in June. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any  appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN ARIEL REBOYRAS   773-794-3095      PETE SCALES   DEPARTMENT OF WATER MANAGEMENT   312-744-8822                        FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late April. Final  restoration will follow in June. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

In January 2001, you called the Board and asked how the lobbyist registration  and  disclosure  provisions  of  the  City’s  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance would apply to your firm’s proposed activities.  You were advised orally that the Board would consider  your  inquiry fully if you requested an advisory opinion, and that, pending a later resolution by the Board, you and/or your firm’s representatives could meet with City personnel without registering as  a  lobbyist.    On  April  23,  2001,  you  requested  an  advisory  opinion  to determine whether, based on the activities  undertaken as described in this opinion, your firm and/or its representatives must register as lobbyists with the Board.  For the reasons explained below, the Board is compelled to determine that:  1)  your  firm  is  acting  as  a  “lobbyist”  (as  defined  in  the  City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance) by virtue of its representatives’ contact with City employees or officials for the purpose of selling the City  [ services   ] offered through your firm by [a principal company] and 2) therefore,  either your firm, or its representatives individually, are required to register under the lobbyist provisions of the Ordinance; and 3) if the City does not issue a Request For Proposals, but instead elects to purchase [                   ] services directly through your firm, and your firm receives its compensation as a sales commission (i.e., it is paid by [the principal company      ] if and only if the City determines to purchase that company’s products and services through your firm), that compensation constitutes a prohibited contingent lobbying fee, and both your firm and the [principal firm] whose product it sells would violate the Ordinance.   FACTS:  You explained that your firm regularly acts as a sales representative on behalf of any number of [principal companies] whose products and services it is authorized by contract to sell and service.  You said that representatives from your firm would be contacting employees of [the department                 ]  to discuss the City’s possible purchase of [                                                                       services] through your firm.  You  described these services as investment contracts whereby the City would invest cash into an account managed by a [principal company] which would invest the money [                                                        ] at either fixed or fluctuating  interest rates.  You also said that your firm’s representatives  would make these contacts not in response to a published Request for Proposals (RFP) issued by the City, but through uninvited “cold calls”on City employees or officials. You also said that the compensation your firm would receive would be paid fully by the [principal company] whose product is sold, solely on a commission basis. Receipt of this commission depends on whether a sale is made–if there is no  Case No. 01021.A August 24, 2001 Page 2  sale, the firm receives no compensation.  The amount of compensation is determined by how much and at what rate the money is invested, and other factors specific to your firm’s relationship with the particular [principal].  You  were  previously  advised  that  your  firm  could  proceed  with  this  course  of  action  without registering as a lobbyist, and that, if the Board later determined (as it now has) that, by virtue of your firm’s conduct it was a lobbyist, and that registration was required, the firm or its associates could register  at  that  time  without  penalty.  On  June  14,  2001,  you  advised  staff  that  your  firm’s representatives had begun making City contacts, and indications were that the City may well be interested in purchasing products and services sold through your firm.  Further, the City may issue an RFP for these products and services, inviting your firm and four others to bid on it. 1  ISSUES: In this opinion, the Board will address the following questions:  1.  Is your firm (or its representatives individually) acting as a “lobbyist” (as defined in the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance) by virtue of its representatives’ contact with City employees or officials for the purpose of attempting to sell the City an investment contract, and, if so, must the firm or its representatives register under the lobbyist provisions of the Ordinance?  2.  Assuming that: a) your firm is acting as a lobbyist; and b) without issuing an RFP, the City elects to purchase [             ] services through your firm; and c) your firm receives its compensation from the [principal company] in the manner described in this opinion, is that compensation a prohibited contingent lobbying fee under § 2-156-300 of the Ordinance?   RELEVANT LAW:  Section 2-156-210 of the Ordinance, “Persons Required to Register,” provides:  Each lobbyist shall register and file reports with the Board of Ethics as provided in  this  Article.    This  section  shall  extend  to  any  person  who  undertakes  to influence any legislative or administrative action as any part of his duties as an employee of another, regardless of whether such person is formally designated as a lobbyist by his employer.   Section  2-156- 010, “Definitions,” sub-parts (a) and (p), provide, respectively:  (a)  ""Administrative  action""  means  any  decision  on,  or  any  proposal, consideration, enactment or making of any rule, regulation, or any other official nonministerial  action  or  non-action  by  any  executive  department,  or  by  any  1The Board notes here and sincerely appreciates your firm’s desire from the outset to understand and  comply with the standards in the Ordinance.   Case No. 01021.A August 24, 2001 Page 3  official or employee of an executive department, or any matter which is within the official jurisdiction of the executive branch.  (p)  ""Lobbyist""  means  any  person  who,  on  behalf  of  any  person  other  than himself, or as any part of his duties as an employee of another, undertakes to influence any legislative or administrative action, including but not limited to:  (1) a bond inducement ordinance; (2) a zoning matter; (3) a concession agreement; (4) the creation of a tax increment financing district; (5) the establishment of a Class 6(b) Cook County property tax classification; (6) the introduction, passage or other action to be taken on an ordinance, resolution, motion, order, appointment or other matter before the City Council;  (7)  the  preparation  of  contract  specifications;  (8)  the solicitation,  award  or  administration  of  a  contract;  (9)  the  award  or administration  of  a  grant,  loan,  or  other  agreement  involving  the disbursement of public monies; or (10) any other determination made by an elected or appointed City official or employee of the City with respect to the procurement of goods, services or construction; provided, however, that a person shall not be deemed to have undertaken to influence any legislative or administrative action solely by submitting an application for a City permit or license or by responding to a City request for proposals or qualifications.  The term ""lobbyist"" shall include, but not be limited to, any attorney, accountant, or consultant engaged in the above-described activities; provided, however, that an  attorney  shall  not  be  considered  a  lobbyist  while  representing  clients  in  a formal adversarial hearing; and provided further that the term ""lobbyist"" shall not include  a  person  who,  on  an  unpaid  basis,  seeks  to  influence  legislative  or administrative action on behalf of an entity that is not engaged in a profit-seeking enterprise;  further  provided  that  an  employee,  officer  or  director  of  a non-for-profit entity who seeks to influence legislative or administrative action on behalf of such an entity shall not be considered a lobbyist for purposes of this chapter.  Last, Section 2-156-300, “Contingent Fees,” provides:   No  person  shall  retain  or  employ  a  lobbyist  for  compensation  contingent  in whole  or  in  part  upon  the  approval  or  disapproval  of  any  legislative  or administrative  matter,  and  no  person  shall  accept  any  such  employment  or render any service for compensation contingent upon the approval or disapproval of any legislative or administrative matter.   Case No. 01021.A August 24, 2001 Page 4  ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS: A.  Is your firm (or its representatives) acting as, and must it register as, a “lobbyist”?  For the reasons that follow, the Board is compelled to conclude that your  firm  (through  its  representatives)  is  indeed  acting  as  a  “lobbyist”  (as  defined  in  the  City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance) by virtue of its representatives’ contact with City employees or officials for the purpose of attempting to sell the City [                   services], and that therefore the firm or its representatives are required to register as a lobbyist.    1.    Did  your  firm  undertake,  on  behalf  of  another,  to  influence  an  administrative  action?    As delineated above, the Ordinance’s definition of “lobbyist” (which became effective on June 7, 2000), includes any person (such as your firm or its representatives), who, “on behalf of another” (such as [a principal] company), “undertakes to influence administrative action,” specifically including “the preparation of contract specifications, or the solicitation, award or administration of a contract,” or “the award or administration of any other agreement involving the disbursement of public monies,” or “any other determination made by an elected or appointed City official or employee of the City with respect to the procurement of goods, services or construction.”   The City’s purchase of the  [                          products and services] offered by [principal companies        ], as described in this opinion, qualifies as the procurement of services.  We therefore conclude that your firm’s contacts, on behalf of another person, namely the [principal companies    ] whose products and services it is authorized to sell, were undertaken to influence a determination made by employees of [the  department            ] to recommend and create–or not to recommend or create–a contract for the  City’s procurement of the cash management products and services your firm would discuss with City employees.  And, we further conclude, the determination to be made by City employees or officials constitutes “administrative action” as defined by the Ordinance.    2.  Do any of the exceptions to the definition of  lobbyist apply?  The definition of “lobbyist” contains five  exceptions.  In summary, they are: that a person shall not be deemed to have undertaken any legislative or administrative action: i) solely by submitting an application for a City permit or license; or  ii)  solely  by  responding  to  a  City  request  for  proposals  or  qualifications;  iii)  attorneys,  while representing  clients  in  a  formal  adversarial  hearing;  iv)  persons  who,  on  unpaid  basis,  seek  to influence legislative or administrative action on behalf of an entity not engaged in a profit-seeking enterprise; and v) employees, officers or directors of non-for-profit entities who seek to influence legislative or administrative action of behalf of such entities.   Clearly, numbers i, iii, iv and v do not apply to the facts in this case.  As to number ii, you have stated that when your firm scheduled the meeting and met with City employees for the purposes described above, it was “cold-calling,” i.e., there was no RFP to which it was responding. While the City may, partly as a result of your firm’s contacts with City employees, in the future issue an RFP for the procurement of the very products and services your firm discussed with City employees, no RFP was issued at the time your firm had those discussions.  Thus we conclude that this exception does not apply to your firm’s conduct.   3.  Must your firm and/or its representatives register under the lobbying provisions?  As to whether your firm and/or its employees must register as lobbyists, the Ordinance provides in § 2-156-210 that  Case No. 01021.A August 24, 2001 Page 5  “each lobbyist shall register and file reports with the Board of Ethics as provided in this Article.”  The Ordinance exempts only four types of persons from its lobbyist registration provisions.2  None of these, however, apply in this case.  Therefore, we conclude that either your firm must register as a lobbyist (listing in its registration the names of each individual associated with it who will be lobbying or who has lobbied), or those individuals themselves must register as lobbyists, listing as clients your firm and the [principal companies] whose products and services they have discussed or in the future will discuss with City employees or officials.  B.  Would your firm’s compensation be a prohibited contingent lobbying fee? As delineated above,  §  2-156-300  of  the  Ordinance  provides  that  no  person  shall  render  any  service  for compensation  contingent  upon  the  approval  or  disapproval  of  any  legislative  or  administrative matter.  As the Board has already concluded that your firm’s conduct was intended to seek approval of an “administrative action,” and thus lobbying, it remains for the Board to address whether your firm’s  compensation,  as  you  have  described  it,  constitutes  a  prohibited  contingent  lobbying  fee. Black’s Law Dictionary (3d Ed., at 290) defines “contingent” as   possible, but not assured ... conditioned upon the occurrence of some future event which is itself uncertain, or questionable ... This term, when applied to a ... legal right or interest, implies that no present interest exists, and that whether such interest or right ever will exist depends upon a future uncertain event.  You have said that your firm’s only compensation for its efforts to market, put together, propose, and, if appropriate, service a contract with the City for [             the] products and services offered by one of the [principal companies] it represents, will come from that [principal company] if and only if, and after, the City procures those services through your firm.  If your firm’s efforts in this respect are unsuccessful,  and  no  City  procurement  occurs  through  your  firm,  then  your  firm  receives  no compensation for its work.  Accordingly, your firm’s compensation for what we have concluded are its lobbying efforts is not a present interest, but is completely conditioned upon a future uncertain event, namely the creation or award of a contract by the City to your firm (and/or [a principal company] through your firm), that is, upon the City’s approval of an administrative matter.  In the absence of any legislative intent to the contrary,3 we are compelled to conclude that, if the City does not issue an RFP, but elects to purchase [               ] services through your firm other than through  2 In § 2-156-220 (“Persons or Entities Not Required to Register”), these four types are, in summary: 1) the  news media; 2) City officials and employees appearing in their official capacities before City agencies; 3) persons who assist in drafting revisions to the City’s Municipal Code at the City’s request; and 4) certain persons who testify publicly before City Council or a Council Committee.   3 The Board attempted to ascertain whether the drafters of the June 2000 amendments to the Ordinance, which include the provisions at issue in this case, intended to exempt sales representatives, such as your firm, from either the definition of “lobbyist” or the registration requirements, or to exempt sales commissions from the prohibition on contingent lobbying fees.  Our inquiry failed to adduce any evidence of such an intent.  Case No. 01021.A August 24, 2001 Page 6  an  RFP,  and  your  firm  receives  its  compensation  in  the  manner  described  above,  then  that compensation indeed constitutes a prohibited contingent lobbying fee.  In that event both your firm and the [principal company] itself would be in violation of this section of the Ordinance.4   DETERMINATIONS:  After conducting considerable research, including an attempt to ascertain the intent of the drafters of the laws we are interpreting, the Board is compelled to determine that your firm is acting as a “lobbyist” (as defined in the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance) by virtue of its representatives’ contact with City employees or officials for the purpose of selling the City [                            services], and that, therefore, either the firm or its representatives individually are required  to  register  under  the  lobbyist  provisions  of  the  Ordinance.    Further,  the  Board  has determined that, if the City does not issue an RFP, but instead elects to purchase [such] services directly through your firm, and your firm receives its compensation in the form of a sales commission (i.e., it is paid by the [principal company        ]  if and only if the City determines to purchase that company’s products and services through your firm), that compensation constitutes a prohibited contingent lobbying fee, and both your firm and the principal company] itself would be in violation of the Ordinance.   Our determinations do not necessarily dispose of all issues relevant to this situation, but are based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify the Board immediately, as any change may alter our opinion.  Other rules or laws may also apply to this situation.  Should the facts presented change, you should contact the Board for further review of the matter.  RELIANCE:  This opinion may be relied upon by (1) any person involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered and (2) any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.    [signature]                   Darryl L. DePriest Chair  01021AO-redact.wpd  4  Because the City has not yet issued a relevant RFP, the Board need not at this time address whether all or any part of your firm’s compensation would be a prohibited contingent lobbying fee if the City does issue an RFP and your firm is the successful bidder.  The Ordinance’s definition of lobbyist states that “a person shall not be deemed to have undertaken to influence any legislative or administrative action solely by ... responding to a City request for proposals or qualifications.” (Emphasis added.)  Resolution of that issue would turn on whether your firm’s compensation stems “solely” from responding to this RFP.   "

A review of the evidence presented at the hearing will aid in understanding this   decision.          Thomas O’Donnell has been a building inspector for the City of Chicago for   about eighteen years and is currently a supervising building inspector.  He has been an   inspector in what was formerly known as the Institutions Public Place of Assembly and   Licensing Unit which conducted inspections of public places of assembly.  He conducted   food and liquor licensing inspections.  He has also been an inspector and supervisor in the   strategic task force which is concerned with properties that have criminal activity.           He is familiar with the Green Dolphin at 2200 N. Ashland Avenue which he   described as a large nightclub.  His most recent inspection was June 21, 2011, the date   before the hearing.  He had also done prior inspections at that location.  Those earlier   inspections revealed issues with egress throughout the building.  There was potential   danger in the event of an emergency there was not an adequate number of doors and the   exit doors were not the proper width.  There was not a proper or adequate means of   egress.  The building’s firewall separation exceeded the maximum allowable square   footage which meant sprinklers were needed or the business needed to be   compartmentalized with firewalls.  Inadequate firewall separation would not stop the   spread of fire and smoke.  These inspections also revealed that a number of alterations      2   had been made to the property which affected egress where the exits were located without   permits or plans.  There was a large single story masonry addition added to the northwest   corner of the building.  There was a small outdoor beer garden enclosed without a permit   and a large patio area that had plans and permits but was not built according to plans   submitted to the City.  The rough approximation of the size of these additions would be   25 x 75 for the masonry addition; 30 x 40 for the beer garden and 50 x 75 for the large   patio.  These additions without permits or not being done according to plans are   dangerous because they could affect egress because the previous egress was altered and   improper materials could be used that were not flame retardant.          O’Donnell met with the owner, the owner’s son, a new architect, and an electrical   contractor at the inspection that took place the day before the hearing.  They received a   new set of plans and a demolition permit to remove a wood-framed garage, a wood deck,   and some stairs on the river bank which they did.          Most of the violations O’Donnell was concerned with had been corrected.  A   number of those things were included on the new set of plans.  There had been some   small or minor interior improvements but the more serious things have not been   corrected.  The first inspection on the ongoing building court case was in May of 2010.    O’Donnell has never recommended to the judge to increase occupancy at this location   and the building department has not recommended increased occupancy.  He would like   to see the business obtain new occupancy cards based on an approved new set plans.  The   new plans he observed at the inspection had not been approved by buildings department.       3   Those plans needed to be approved by zoning review before the submittal process at the   Department of Buildings begins.  2200 North Ashland Avenue is not in full compliance   with the buildings department at this time.          O’Donnell testified he was working off an amended complaint at this inspection.    That complaint alleged 51 or 53 violations.  From his perspective only a couple of minor   smaller improvements and changes have been addressed.  The electrical and plumbing   counts on the complaint are not in his area.  O’Donnell did not know if 48 of the 51   violations had been completed.  Over the City’s objection, Respondent’s Exhibit 1, the   First Amended Complaint for Equitable and Other Relief, was allowed in evidence.          O’Donnell agreed that various allegations in the First Amended Complaint dealt   with specific areas in the Jazz Room, the Dolphin Room (that is the West and East   Room) that have been corrected since the initial complaint.  He also agreed additional   doors were installed that solved some of the egress problems but they were installed   without a permit.  O’Donnell referred to Count 36, subparagraph 3, which asked that the   licensee “rework east exit door at Webster Street entrance vestibule so it does not drag on   the sidewalk.”  That was not done as of the inspection the day before the hearing.    Paragraph 6, asking the licensee to remove a coiled overhead shutter in the west room   also had not been done at the time of this last inspection.  While O’Donnell admitted he   had never been at the premise at night, he opined this is a primary entrance point for the   licensee’s business.  He also opined this was a relatively simple item to correct.  As to the   coiled overhead shutter door, O’Donnell explained that work could not be done in      4   minutes but could be done during hours the business is not open.  The licensee would   need plans and permit for this work and this work is included on the new plans that will   be submitted.          O’Donnell testified that he believed Judge Pileggi, by court order, had closed the   area of the tent beer garden and the outside beer garden pending new plans and a new   permit being issued.  He further stated he has been at some of the status hearings on the   building court case but not all the status hearings.  He agreed there has been some   compliance but has not seen significant compliance with the items he identified as   potentially dangerous.  There has been some compliance with regards to egress but not   with respect to the firewall.  The permits needed to do the firewall work have not been   issued.  There is a count in the amended complaint with respect to the fact that the second   egree from the second floor office was removed when one of the additions was done.    This would raise the same concern with regard to people leaving the establishment.    O’Donnell never recommended that Judge Pileggi increase occupancy and he has   concerns about occupancy relating to the danger this building presented to the public.          Patrick Haran has been a plumbing inspector for the City of Chicago for nine   years.  He inspects plumbing systems to verify it is up to code, verify it has proper water   service, and verify it has the proper water heater.  With respect to commercial buildings   that need additional fixtures he ensures the fixtures are installed properly, that they be   handicap accessible and verify there are the proper amount of toilets and sinks.  He has   participated in inspections for the Green Dolphin bar at 2200 N. Ashland Avenue, the last      5   inspection being performed the date before the hearing.  He inspected as early as May of   2010.  He found several violations such as inadequate amount of toilet sinks, hand sinks   and mop sink.  There were additional fixtures that had been installed without a permit.    There were no handicap facilities and an inadequate number of lavatories with improper   water service.  There was also a problem with the mop sink which was potentially   dangerous and hazardous.          The inspection the day before the hearing revealed that a plumbing permit was   pulled earlier this year.  Some of the violations had been addressed, but the main   violations concerning adding sufficient plumbing fixtures, upgrading the water service   and adding handicapped accessibility to the bathroom remained.  With the permit the   licensee did install hand sinks behind the bar but they were installed improperly.  The   drain was tied into the downspout underneath the floor when it should have been   connected to the sewer.  This could cause the release of sewer gas in the room after it   rains.  The bathrooms have not come into compliance and he discussed with the architect   at the inspection the number of fixtures that would be needed.  At present the corrected   violations would be service work, not major corrections and the plumbing counts left   open are more important than what has been done.          Haran acknowledged being present for some of the status conferences in building   court but could not recall a status on May 30, 2011, and did not recall Judge Hughes    asking if he had concerns about dangerous conditions on the premises.  He added there is   nothing dangerous now but added if the traps are sucked out of the sink it could cause      6   sewer gas which would be a dangerous condition.  That is in the tainted area and the main   bar area.              Over the City’s objections Respondent’s Group Exhibit 2, consisting of orders   from the building court case entered on November 16, 22 and December 10 were allowed   in evidence.          Ron Gardner has been an architect since 1976 and was Deputy Commissioner of   the Department of Buildings for six years under Mayor Harold Washington and Eugene   Sawyer.  He is now President of Group Design Associates, Incorporated, which consists   of architects, engineers, planners and construction managers.  He has been working with   Green Dolphin, Incorporated, since the summer of 2010.  He has been present at a few of   the inspections and is working through zoning, as well as, the building department to   ensure the proper permits are issued.  They are presently working for approval from   zoning and landscape.  Revised plans were submitted to zoning and they are in the   process of working on correction with landscape review.  He hoped that landscape review   would be approved as early as the next week, and then they could address the zoning   issue.  Based on his experience it could be a couple of months before permits would   issue.          Mr. Gardner was present for the testimony of Mr. O’Donnell and the plumbing   inspection.  He agrees there are code violations but does not agree that they are dangerous   or hazardous to the public.       7      Article 4 of the State of Illinois Liquor Control Act is entitled “Local Control”   and it enumerates the powers given to a city, village, incorporated town, and a county    board with respect to control of alcohol and it also designates who is the local liquor   control commissioner of each such government body for the purpose of administering   this rule.  235 ILCS 5/4-1 does indicate that issuance of licenses shall not be prohibited   except for the reasons listed in Section 6-2, 6-11, 6-12, and 6-25 of the Liquor Control   Act.          235 ILCS 5/7-9 of the Liquor Control Act gives jurisdiction to this Commission   of cases involving the granting or refusing to grant a license and that matter is tried de   novo by this Commission.          Counsel for the licensee has made a legal argument that states in essence that   Section 6-1 of the Act dealing with refusal to renew deals only with the State of Illinois   liquor license.  The argument is that this section does not empower a local liquor control   commissioner to refuse to renew based on suitability of the premises.  This seems in   essence to an argument on the jurisdiction of this Commission.  If the local does not have   the authority to refuse to renew a license for suitability grounds, then how does this   Commission have jurisdiction.  That argument is not reflected on the appeal filed by the   licensee.  In fact it was the licensee’s appeal that brought this case before this   Commission.  If the licensee felt there was no jurisdiction before this Commission it   could have gone directly to the Circuit Court.  Since jurisdiction may be raised at any      9   time and particularly since jurisdiction of this Commission is set up by State Statute it is   necessary to address whether this matter is properly before this Commission.          235 ILCS 5/7-9 allows for the appeal of any order or action of a local liquor   control commissioner “granting or refusing to grant a license or revoking or suspending a   license.”  This language delineates granting or refusing to grant a license from revoking   or suspending a license.  The action in this case is entitled Refusal to Renew which would   be encompassed in the clause refusing to grant a license.  This section goes on to give this   jurisdiction to determine the propriety of this refusal de novo.          Case law from state and federal court support the position that this Commission   would have jurisdiction.  The case of City of Wyoming vs. Local Liquor Control   Commission of Illinois, dealt with the refusal of the Mayor of the City of Wyoming as   the local liquor control commissioner to renew the local liquor license of Wyoming Super   Value, Inc.  This decision was appealed to the State of Illinois Liquor Control   Commission which reversed the failure to renew.  The Appellate Court commented that   “while the state statute did not expressly require compliance with procedural   requirements when a local liquor control commissioner refuses to renew it could not have   been the legislative intent that a local liquor control commissioner be able to easily avoid   the application of the statutory procedural requirements to license revocation by waiting   for the license to expire and then refuse to issue a renewal license.”  For that reason the   court interpreted the term “revocation” to include the refusal to issue a renewal license.          10
