This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,029 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Palmer Street, from N.  Maplewood Avenue to N. Western Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1887, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Moreno’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                                                        Anne Sullivan began teaching 6 year old, blind and deaf Helen Keller.    Oregon became the first state to make Labor Day a holiday.    Britain celebrated the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.    Susanna Medora Salter was elected the first U.S. woman mayor (Argonia, Kansas).    The fire escape was patented.    Boris Karloff, an icon of horror cinema, was born.            PALMER WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,029 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Palmer Street, from N. Maplewood Avenue to N. Western Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1887 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late April 2013. Restoration will follow in late May 2013. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Palmer outside of our working hours.  When we are  working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able  to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOE MORENO III   773-278-0101                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late April 2013.  Restoration will be completed in late May 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.                Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

In August, the Department of Water Management’s crews will begin work to install a new  sewer main in N. Hamlin Avenue (Irving Park-Elston). The old sewer dates back to 1901  and needs to be replaced.     During construction, we will require a partial closure of Irving Park at Hamlin for a few  days. Detour routes will be posted in advance. Otherwise, when we are working in the  street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always be able to reach your  home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic  only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    45th Ward Office: 773-286-4545    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner

The public chauffeur rules now include a “CH” prefix to each rule and were  amended after notice and comment as follows:   1.  Olive Harvey College, City Colleges of Chicago, is now authorized to  administer public chauffeur training courses and licensing exams for  both taxicab and limo driver applicants.   2.  BACP will no longer administer the licensing exams for taxicab and   limo drivers.   3.  Public chauffeurs may renew their licenses up to 45 days before their   licenses expire.  They no longer need to wait to renew in their birth  month.   4.  Starting immediately, Public chauffeur licensees will be issued with   expiration dates based on the licensee’s birth date – thus licenses will  expire on specific dates throughout the month of birth as Illinois  State driver licenses do.   5.

PAUL, Minn. -- Individuals affected by the flooding that began on March 16, 2009, are urged to begin  cleaning up their homes and personal property as soon as possible. Officials from Minnesota’s Homeland  Security Emergency Management (HSEM) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  emphasize that it is not necessary to wait for an inspection before beginning this process.   ""We encourage individuals affected by the disaster to remain cautious and return home only when it is safe to  do so,"" said Federal Coordinating Officer Mike Smith. ""Property owners should document all losses and  damages by taking photos first, or making a list, and then begin immediately removing all flood damaged  personal property.""   Before making permanent repairs to your home-such as drywall, structural components, electrical systems or  plumbing-make sure you get the proper permits from your local community or county permitting officials. This  is especially important for those living in a Special Flood Hazard Area to ensure compliance with local  floodplain management requirements.   ""Our main concern is the health and safety of Minnesotans as they begin the clean-up process,"" said State  Coordinating Officer Kris Eide. ""It is important for homeowners to get accurate information from state and  local officials in order to protect themselves and their loved ones.""   The following precautions are suggestions that residents in flooded areas may want to implement:     Confirm the water supply is safe to drink. Listen for news reports to learn whether the community’s  water supply has been contaminated by the floodwaters. Remember to carry bottled drinking water and  discard any food products that may have come in contact with floodwater.     Wear protective clothing. Protect yourself during cleanup by wearing boots, gloves and masks. Clean     Ventilate your home. Open all doors and windows to allow air to circulate and dry out your home.     Service damaged septic tanks, cesspools, pit and leaching systems as soon as possible. Damaged   and disinfect everything floodwater contacted.   Dehumidify as soon as possible after a flood.   sewage systems are serious health hazards.     Make a list of lost or damaged items. Be sure to include their age and value, and if possible, have   receipts for those items available.     Prevent mold growth. Wash all surface areas in the house that came in contact with floodwater.   Disinfect and wipe surfaces dry with paper towels to minimize bacterial contamination.  Isolate any moldy objects. Seal moldy trash in plastic bags and remove them immediately. Objects you  can save should be dried or frozen as soon as possible. Freezing inactivates mold.      For more tips on cleaning up and keeping your family safe, visit www.fema.gov/hazard/flood/,  www.minnesotarecovers.org  or the CDC’s flood website at www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/floods/.   FEMA coordinates the Federal government's role in preparing for, preventing, mitigating the effects of,  responding to, and recovering from all domestic disasters, whether natural or man-made, including acts of    safe.

By late January 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,369 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Houston  Avenue, from E. 82nd Street to E. 83rd Place, E. 83rd Place, from S. Commercial Avenue to S. Bond  Avenue and E. 83rd Street, from S. Commercial Avenue to S. Houston Avenue. The old water main  dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  7th Ward Office: 773-731-7777  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016
