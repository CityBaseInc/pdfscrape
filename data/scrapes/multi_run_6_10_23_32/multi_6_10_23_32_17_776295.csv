The Commission is responsi- ble for recommending to the City Council which individual buildings, sites, objects, or districts  should be designated as Chicago Landmarks, which protects them by law.   The landmark designation process begins with a staff study and a preliminary summary of  information related to the potential designation criteria. The next step is a preliminary vote by the  landmarks commission as to whether the proposed landmark is worthy of consideration. This vote  not only initiates the formal designation process, but it places the review of city permits for the  property under the jurisdiction of the Commission until a final landmark recommendation is act- ed on by the City Council.   This Landmark Designation Report is subject to possible revision and amendment during  the designation process. Only language contained within a designation ordinance adopted by the  City Council should be regarded as final.   2                      1905 (ORIGINAL TWO-STORY BUILDING)  1914 (TOP THREE STORIES)  NIMMONS AND FELLOWS (1905)  GEORGE C.

District is comprised of four buildings and a park with pergola constructed from 1905  to 1907 by the Sears, Roebuck and Co. for its long-time headquarters campus.  This ensemble ex- emplifies the historic importance of Sears as one of Chicago's most important companies and  America's leading retailer for much of the twentieth century.    1906  NIMMONS AND FELLOWS   1906  NIMMONS AND FELLOWS   1907  NIMMONS AND FELLOWS   3       Sears, Roebuck and Co. grew rapidly from its founding in 1894 to become the nation's largest pur- veyor of goods to small-town and rural America.  Chicago’s excellent transportation infrastructure  and manufacturing base made the city an ideal location for mail-order merchants, of which Sears  was the largest.  In the 1920s the company augmented its catalog business with retail stores to cater  to an increasingly mobile and urban population. By the 1960s, Sears was the largest retailer in the  world and was the first to achieve $1 billion in monthly sales.     The district is closely associated with the careers of three important Sears, Roebuck and Co. execu- tives who are regarded as important figures in the history of American business.  Richard W. Sears,   the company's founder and first president, originated the Sears mail-order catalog, an iconic symbol  of American merchandising, and through the catalog, Sears cemented the company’s long-standing  relationship with rural and small-town customers.  Julius Rosenwald, who succeeded Sears as com- pany president, was the driving force behind the construction of the Sears headquarters campus in  North Lawndale.  Rosenwald managed the company's expansion during the early 20th century,  while becoming a leading philanthropist, supporting the University of Chicago, Adler Planetarium  and a variety of African-American causes throughout the United States.  Robert Wood, Sears’ third  president, guided the company’s embrace of “bricks-and-mortar” retail stores, which allowed Sears  to maintain its leading position as a national merchant in the post-World War II era.    In addition to its historic significance, the Sears, Roebuck and Co. District is a fine ensemble of his- toric commercial and industrial architecture, as well as landscape design.  Though the buildings  each served different purposes, they were designed to be visually cohesive and to be a statement of  Sears’ outstanding role in American business.  The buildings and pergola of the district were de- signed by the nationally-significant architectural firm of Nimmons and Fellows, with later additions  to the Administration and MDL buildings being the work of George C. Nimmons.  Nimmons was  an early twentieth-century expert in industrial architectural design and a master in combining the  Chicago School principle of a clearly- and rationally-expressed structure with Classical- and Prairie -style ornament.     The historic and architectural significance of the Sears, Roebuck and Co. headquarters and mail  order plant was first recognized in 1978 when the complex was designated by the federal govern- ment as a National Historic Landmark (NHL), one of only 2500 historic places in the US which  “possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United  States.” Despite this recognition, the catalog operation of Sears was becoming unprofitable.  Opera- tions at the mail order plant were scaled back and they were completely halted in 1987.  In 1993 the  unprofitable catalog operation and underperforming stores were closed.      Due to the size of the Sears Campus and the impact its closing would have on the City and neigh- borhood, the Sears corporation recruited a development entity in 1993 to plan a reuse for the vacant  buildings and redevelop the campus for the neighborhood.  The complex would be renamed Homan  Square.  As part of this agreement, the Merchandise Building was determined to be unable to be  reused and it was demolished, with the exception of the tower.  The ongoing redevelopment of  Homan Square is discussed on page 26.  Before demolition, the complex was extensively docu- mented by the Historic American Building Survey (HABS), a National Park Service program.  In  2002, the Sears Administration Building was individually designated as a Chicago Landmark.            4      The Sears, Roebuck and Co. District is located on the Far West Side of Chicago in the North  Lawndale community area.  The District consists of four buildings and a park with pergola  situated on eight acres of land centered around the intersection of S. Homan Avenue and W.  Arthington Street.  The aerial photo (top) shows the arrangement of the historic structures  and park on the site.      This map is meant for illustrative purposes only. The final district boundary and description would be defined in a  Chicago landmark designation ordinance passed by City Council.   5        THE HISTORY OF SEARS, ROEBUCK AND CO.    Throughout much of the twentieth century, Sears, Roebuck and Co. was a national leader in the  merchandising industry, first as a premiere mail-order company, then later adding retail stores.   In the early-20th century, Sears’ products transformed the material cultural of households,  farms and workshops in rural areas and small towns across the country through the wide-spread  American embrace of the Sears mail-order catalog.  As America became more urban and mo- bile in the 1920s, Sears’ expanded its mail-order business with a nationwide chain of retail  stores that helped it maintain its position as one of America’s leading merchandise companies  in the post-World War II era.      Sears’ immense processing, manufacturing, printing, shipping and warehousing activities made  a significant contribution to Chicago’s economic development for much of the 20th century.   The city was ideally located to bring rural consumers and urban manufacturers together through  the catalogs which offered a glimpse of city life and direct access to products with no ""middle  man.""  In his book Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West (1991), environmental  historian William Cronon described the Chicago mail-order business model:     Henceforth, it needn't really matter whether one lived in city or country, for the good  life could be purchased by mail wherever one made one's home. The advent of the  post office's rural free delivery in 1896 was an immediate consequence of the public  demand that Ward and Sears had helped create, and it pointed the way to the roads,  telephones, electrical networks, and chain stores that would transform the rural land- scape of America in the twentieth century.     It would also, as Cronon points out, provide a conduit for transmitting the wealth of the rural  areas back to the city.  This transfer of wealth from country to city was not unwelcome to rural  Americans as farm families benefitted from lower prices on mail-order goods compared to pric- es at local small-town retail prices.  In the late-19th century, these households sold their crops  for cash and bought goods from local stores where the price of retail goods was often 100 per- cent more than wholesale costs of the same products in cities where they were manufactured.   Organizations of farmers such as “the Grange” protested inflated prices offered by local  “middlemen.”  Mail-order companies such as Sears were able to offer goods at lower costs by  elimination such middleman, by leveraging expanding rail networks to distribute goods and by  taking advantage of the then-new free rural delivery offered by the post office (another service  advocated by the Grange) to reach rural customers.      The company’s establishment by Richard Sears and the creation of the Sears catalog  Though Sears, Roebuck & Co. achieved its most lasting importance as a Chicago company, it  traces its origins to Minnesota.  There in the small town of North Redwood, Richard Warren  Sears (1863-1914) worked as a telegrapher and station agent for the Minneapolis and St. Louis  Railroad.  In addition to his employment with the railroad, Sears dabbled in selling goods to the  townspeople of North Redwood.  In 1886 he bought a shipment of wholesale Chicago-made  watches and resold them at a modest profit.  Watches at this time, particularly in rural America,  were becoming more of a necessity than a luxury as daily life became more regulated by train  schedules.     6     for the first 80 of what would become 300 new units of housing, a new community center, YMCA,  grade schools and high schools. The Homan Square redevelopment has gained national recognition  as a model of urban revitalization.    The redevelopment plans continue under the Foundation for Homan Square, a not-for-profit organi- zation.  In 2009 the Foundation spearheaded the restoration and adaptation of the 1905 Power  House into a modern public charter high school, a project which has won numerous awards in the  areas of historic preservation, energy efficiency and education.      MAIL-ORDER COMPANIES IN CHICAGO    By the turn of the twentieth century, Chicago was the major center for mail-order retailers in the  United States.  “Mail-order houses,” as these retailers were commonly known, were a distinctly  American retailing innovation that developed in response to the needs of a primarily rural citizenry  spread over a vast area.  In comparison to mail order offerings, country stores offered small inven- tories of overpriced products.      The heyday of the mail-order business occurred between the 1890s and the 1910s, when it was  dominated by Chicago-based companies Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Montgomery Ward. During  this period, these companies became two of the largest business enterprises in the United States.  Chicago’s central location and its network of railroads made the city a logical choice for the mail- order trade.  By the turn of the century, Chicago had emerged as the most important railroad center  in the country, with more lines of track radiating in more directions than any other city.  The system  of railroads connected the city to the Midwest’s agriculture-producing regions which made Chicago  the central point of the grain, livestock, and meat packing industries.  Early mail-order retailers rec- ognized that the system of rail lines that brought grain and livestock into Chicago for processing  could also be used as a distribution system that delivered finished goods cheaply and efficiently to  those same far-flung farming communities.  Moreover, Chicago’s reputation as a major manufac- turing center meant that many of the goods sold by mail order retailers – from candy to furniture –  were made by Chicago companies.       The first large retailer to use catalogs as its primary promotional tool and to sell directly to the rural  consumer was Chicago-based Montgomery Ward.  Aaron Montgomery Ward, a New Jersey native,  came to Chicago in 1866 and went to work for large dry-goods business of Field, Palmer, & Leiter  (which would later become Marshall Field & Co.).  There Ward worked as a field representative  selling products in rural areas.  In 1872 Ward struck out on his own with an innovative mail-order  business that marketed and sold items directly to rural consumers.  .     Ward’s first catalog in August 1872 was a single-sheet price list of 163 items; in a mere two years  the catalog had grown to over 100 pages with over 25,000 items ranging from clothing to steam  engines.  In 1875, the company instituted an unprecedented policy that promised “satisfaction guar- anteed or your money back.”  By the early 1900s, Wards employed over 7,000 men and women in  Chicago and was selling tens of millions of dollars in goods annually. The Montgomery Ward &  Co. Catalog House at 600-618 W. Chicago Avenue (1907-1908) is a designated Chicago Land- mark, while the Montgomery Ward Building at 6 N. Michigan Avenue, designed by Richard E.  Schmidt and begun in 1899, is located within the Historic Michigan Boulevard Chicago Landmark  District.     19   "

If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas H. Powers, P.E.   Commissioner       cc: Alderman Scott Waguespack        32nd Ward            Do you wonder what was happening in 1885?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                                                            “Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with   their ingenuity.” – GEORGE S. PATTON        Dr. W. W. Grant of Iowa performed the first appendectomy.    The U.S. Salvation Army was officially organized.    “Good Housekeeping” magazine was first published.     The Statue of Liberty arrived in New York City.    Louis Pasteur successfully tested an anti-rabies vaccine.    Fingerprints started being used for identification.    American General George S. Patton was born.                          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,356 feet of 8-inch water main in  N. Clifton Avenue, from W. Webster Avenue to W. Armitage Avenue.            Reason: The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1885, and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Work starts shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in late June (restoration  will follow in late July). This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected  developments in the street, or other circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our  schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Clifton Avenue without interruption, but we will  have to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   ALDERMAN SCOTT WAGUESPACK   773-248-1330   3-1-1         312-742-1029   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June.  Restoration will follow in late July. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are  at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016      Good morning Chairman Austin, Vice Chairman Ervin, members of the Committee on Budget  and Government Operations and members of the City Council. I would like to thank you for the  opportunity  to  present  to  you  the  2017  Budget  proposal  for  the  Department  of  Water  Management (DWM).       Our  mission  is  to  ensure  the  health  of  the  public  in  the  most  environmentally  and  fiscally  responsible  manner  by delivering  a  sufficient  supply  of quality  water  and  efficiently  managing  waste and stormwater.       Through our operations at the Jardine and Sawyer Water Purification Plants – the two largest  conventional  treatment  plants  in  the  world  –  DWM  purifies,  on  average,  about  800  million  gallons of water a day.  We also operate 12 pumping stations that distribute water through more  than  4,400  miles  of  water  mains.    On  the  sewer  side,  the  department  is  responsible  for  transmission of wastewater through more than 4,400 miles of sewer mains to the Metropolitan  Water Reclamation District.        We  provide  purified  water  to  more  than  2.7  million  customers  in  Chicago  and  2.67  million  customers in 125 surrounding suburbs.  On a daily basis, more than 5.3 million customers, or 42  percent of the Illinois population, depend on our infrastructure for clean, safe drinking water.        Since my confirmation in May, we have continued to meet our goals of Mayor Emanuel’s 10- year  capital  program,  now  almost  at  the  halfway  mark.    In  June,  we  hosted  ACE16  -  the  American  Water  Works  Association’s  Annual  Conference  and  Exposition  -  where  more  than  14,000 water professionals gathered to learn from one another.  At the conference I explained  why every time they went from point A to point B, whether to dinner, the airport or sightseeing,  their route might be slowed due to our construction.  We have been in every ward over the last  five  years  either  replacing  water  mains  or  sewer  mains  or  lining  structures  and  sewers.  Our  crews are hard at work to upgrade our aging infrastructure to ensure we won't have to be back  again for decades. Further, every dollar spent improving our infrastructure puts people to work,  which is a tangible benefit to our residents and our communities.        Today,  we  continue to  actively  move  closer  to  reaching  our goals  established  in  2011,  which  include:    •  Replacing 880 miles of water mains;  •  Replacing 250 miles of sewer mains;   Page -1-      Department of Water Management    2017 Budget Hearing   Remarks of Barrett B. Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016   •  Lining  more  than  470  miles  of  sewers  and  140,000  sewer  structures  to  extend  their   useful life; and   •  Converting three pumping stations from steam to electric power.      I could not be prouder of the men and women who work for the Department, helping each day to  make  our  plans  a  reality.  In  the  last  four  years  we  have  hired  or  promoted  more  than  700  employees.  Throughout  training  and  professional  development to ensure the safe and efficient execution of the capital plan.    the  Department,  we  ensure  proper      The  ability  to  provide  quality,  cost-effective  and  reliable  services  requires  a  multi-faceted  administrative effort.  That includes: incorporating facility assessments; working with the various  labor unions to achieve work rule compliance; executing competitive contracts; coordinating with  other agencies, utilities and departments; and implementing traditional and alternative funding to  avoid overburdening future generations.       We  constantly  coordinate  with  other  departments,  with  your  ward  staff,  utilities  and  other  agencies  to  identify  opportunities  for  collaboration.  The  use  of  the  latest  mapping  and  scheduling  technology,  as  well  as  monthly  coordination  meetings  between  departments  and  utilities, has contributed to an accelerated and more efficient and cost-effective program.        Earlier  this  year,  the  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  highlighted  our  Department  as  a  success story, saying that, ""In 2014, investments by … the CDWM generated nearly 20,000  total  jobs,  including  more  than  10,000  direct  construction,  water,  and  sewage  jobs…  increased regional economic output by almost $2 billion over the year.”       Infrastructure  investments  are  a  win-win  for  Chicago  and  Illinois.  The  investments  improve  environmental  quality  for  households  and  businesses;  provide  middle-class  employment  for  construction workers & the employees of water facilities; preserves our most precious resource;  and ripples into other sectors of the economy.      We  continue  to  improve  operations  and  maintenance,  which  includes  addressing  emergency  repairs and other calls for service. Work orders are being completed and closed more quickly,  resulting in a decreased backlog. In the areas of leaks and breaks, no water, water in basement,  catch basin repair requests and sewer cave-ins, our response times are down as well, as are  the number of open service requests. This increased productivity is due to the hard work of our  men and women in the field, the reduction in water main breaks and collapsed sewers due to  capital work, and by holding crews accountable to do their work efficiently and safely.    Page -2-      Department of Water Management    2017 Budget Hearing   Remarks of Barrett B. Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016      The  MeterSave  Program  is  an  important  program  that  saves  water,  and  at  the  same  time,  it  saves our customers money. This year, we will exceed our installation goal of 15,000 meters.  The only way to know exactly how much water someone is using is to measure it.  With more  awareness of water use, we will all become better stewards of this great natural resource. Word  of mouth is our best marketing tool and we truly appreciate you and your staff’s assistance in  this effort as we continue to promote installation of water meters for all properties.      In 2017, our administrative goals remain the same: reform and improve where we can; cut, or  amend our approach where we must; and invest where it matters. Our construction targets for  2017 will include:   •  90 miles of water main installation  •  15,000 MeterSave meter installations  •  29 miles of sewer main installation  •  52 miles of sewer main lining  •  14,000 structure linings      At the end of our 10-year program, DWM will have invested nearly $7 billion in the improvement  of our water and sewer systems.  As Commissioner of the Department of Water Management, I  pledge to continue to work with each of you as we look at the service needs in your wards to  make the improvements necessary to maintain and improve quality of life. I am committed to  remaining  accessible  and  improving  communications  between  our  Department  and  you  and  your staff.       We  have  accomplished  much  in  2016,  and  I  look  forward  to  continuing  to  deliver  the  best  possible services to the residents of Chicago next year. Together, we will ensure that Chicago’s  water and sewer system provides high-quality service to all of our customers.       Thank you.         Page -3-      "

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you,  our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our private contractor will soon be installing a new sewer in:     N. Menard Avenue, from N. Milwaukee Avenue to N. Magnet Avenue    N. Menard Avenue, from N. Manila Avenue to N. Northwest Highway    N. Magnet Avenue, from N. Menard Avenue to approx. 485’ south of N. Manila Avenue    N. Manila Avenue, from N. Magnet Avenue to N. Menard Avenue    W. Catalpa Avenue, from N. Menard Avenue to N. Mason Avenue      The old pipe dates back to 1902, and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Arena’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.

That’s the year the old sewer main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:         Richard J. Daley        Animal Crackers were introduced to the American public.    Theodore Roosevelt became the first American President to ride in an automobile.    The first college football bowl game, the Rose Bowl between Michigan and Stanford,   was held in Pasadena, California.               JC Penney opened its first store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming.    The Texas Oil Company, Texaco, was formed.    Denmark became the first country to adopt fingerprinting as a way to identify criminals.    Richard J. Daley was born; he served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in   1976.                    PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management’s private contractor will soon be installing a  new sewer in:      N. Menard Avenue, from N. Milwaukee Avenue to N. Magnet Avenue    N. Menard Avenue, from N. Manila Avenue to N. Northwest Highway    N. Magnet Avenue, from N. Menard Avenue to approx. 485’ south of N. Manila Avenue    N. Manila Avenue, from N. Magnet Avenue to N. Menard Avenue    W. Catalpa Avenue, from N. Menard Avenue to N. Mason Avenue      Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1902 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by  Milwaukee on the north and east, Northwest Highway on the south, and Mason on the west will  benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work begins shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in mid-November.  Restoration of the damaged streets/parkways will follow. If the weather permits, we expect full  restoration to occur in late November. Otherwise, a concrete base will be placed at the time and  the streets will be paved with asphalt in May 2013. Dates may change depending on weather and  other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:   When we are working in the street, we will have closures to “through traffic”. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Safety is our first consideration.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.           CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE             ALDERMAN JOHN ARENA   773-286-4545   3-1-1            312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Arena, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.             Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!
