On October 31, 2013, Officer Smith filed with the Police Board a request for Police   Board review of this suspension. On November 6, 2013, Officer Smith filed with the Police   Board a memorandum delineating specific reasons for which the review was requested.    The Executive Director of the Police Board assigned this matter to Hearing Officer   Jacqueline A. Walker.  Hearing Officer Walker reviewed the investigation file and submitted a   written report to the Police Board.     The members of the Police Board reviewed the Summary Report of the investigation file,   the Command Channel Review reports, Officer Smith’s memorandum, and Hearing Officer   Walker’s report.  Hearing Officer Walker made an oral report to and conferred with the Police   Board before it rendered its findings and decision.       POLICE BOARD FINDINGS   The Police Board of the City of Chicago, as a result of its consideration of this matter,   finds and determines that:   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2317  Police Officer Chad Smith  Findings and Decision                 1.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Chad Smith, Star No. 6021,   violated Rule 1 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On July 16, 2011, at approximately 1525 hours, at 2150 North California Avenue, Chicago,  Officer Smith failed to secure and control an arrestee, resulting in the arrestee escaping.     The Department’s investigation indicated on the date as charged, Officer Smith and   Police Officer Kenneth Trempe investigated a report of juveniles shoplifting at K-Mart, located   at 1360 North Ashland Avenue.  As a result, two juveniles were placed in custody and both were   taken to the 14th District for processing.  Both juveniles were handcuffed together.        The investigation further revealed that when Officers Smith and Trempe arrived at the   14th District parking lot, and while the Officers were escorting the two juveniles, one of the   juveniles freed his hand from the handcuffs and fled on foot, and successfully made his escape.    The escapee was not readily found in the area, even though a search for him was conducted.                On August 4, 2011, the juvenile was subsequently apprehended and charged with escape.      2.   The Police Board has considered the facts and circumstances of Officer Smith’s   conduct, and his complimentary and disciplinary histories.  This case involves the escape of a   juvenile arrested for a non-violent offense (shoplifting).  Officer Smith and his partner   immediately attempted to apprehend the escapee, and promptly made notifications of the escape.   The escapee was subsequently located, arrested, and charged with escape about three weeks   later.  The Board finds that the ten-day suspension ordered in this case is unwarranted, and that   the one-day suspension recommended by the investigator, all members of Command Channel      2   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2317  Police Officer Chad Smith  Findings and Decision    Review, and the Chief of the Bureau of Internal Affairs is a justified penalty on the facts of this               particular case.          POLICE BOARD DECISION      The Police Board of the City of Chicago hereby adopts the findings set forth herein by   the following vote:      By a vote of 9 in favor (Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William  F. Conlon, Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D.  Sweeney) to 0 opposed, the Board sustains the allegation that Police Officer Chad Smith  violated Rule 5.     As a result of the foregoing, the Board, by a vote of 9 in favor (Carney, Foreman, Ballate,   Conlon, Eaddy, Fry, McKeever, Rodriguez, and Sweeney) to 0 opposed, hereby determines that   cause exists for suspending Police Officer Chad Smith from his position as a police officer with   the Department of Police, and from the services of the City of Chicago, for a period of one (1)   day.   NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the suspension of Police   Officer Chad Smith, Star No. 6021, for a period of ten (10) days is reduced to a period of one   (1) day.    This disciplinary action is adopted and entered by a majority of the members of the   Police Board: Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William F. Conlon,   Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D. Sweeney.

By late June 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,283 feet of new 8-inch and 2,977 feet of new 12- inch water main in S. Wood Street, from S. Archer Avenue to W. 37th St. and W. 33rd Street, from S.  Wood Street to S. Ashland Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1879, and needs to be  replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  12th Ward Office: 773-523-8250  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016
