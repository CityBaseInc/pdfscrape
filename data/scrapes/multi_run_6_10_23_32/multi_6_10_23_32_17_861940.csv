By	late	January	2018,	Department	of	Water	Management	(DWM)	and	Benchmark	Construction	 Company	crews	will	begin	the	work	to	install	4,384	feet	of	new	12‐inch	water	main	in	S.	Damen	 Avenue,	from	W.	63rd	Street	to	W.	69th	Place	and	W.	65th	Street,	from	S.	Damen	Avenue	to	S.	Wolcott	 Avenue.	The	old	water	main	dates	back	to	1890,	and	needs	to	be	replaced.	We	expect	all	work	to	be	 completed	by	late	May	2018.	This	includes	restoration.	Dates	may	change	depending	on	weather	 and	other	factors.	 	If	you	would	like	to	receive	regular	email	updates	about	the	progress	of	the	project,	please	go	to	 BuildingANewChicago.org	to	register	for	the	WaterALERT	program.		Simply	enter	your	name,	 email	address	and	the	project	identification	number	at	the	top	of	this	letter.	 	By	signing	up	for	the	WaterALERT	emails,	you	will	be	notified	as	the	project	enters	each	new	 construction	phase	–	from	our	mobilization	of	equipment	onto	the	site,	to	the	installation	of	new	 pipes,	to	the	final	restoration	of	the	street.	 	When	we	are	working	in	the	street,	we	may	close	or	limit	it	to	traffic	for	safety	reasons,	but	you	will	 always	be	able	to	reach	your	home	or	business.		Outside	of	working	hours,	a	travel	lane	will	be	left	 open	for	local	traffic	only.		 	We	will	post	our	work	area	for	“No	Parking”	as	needed	during	work	hours	(generally	7am‐4pm).		 Parking	outside	of	those	hours	will	be	allowed,	but	cars	will	need	to	be	moved	by	the	start	of	the	 next	workday.		We	will	try	to	preserve	as	much	parking	space	as	possible.	 	We	know	that	construction	always	involves	inconveniences	and	noise.	We	will	do	everything	 possible	to	maintain	your	quality	of	life	throughout	these	projects,	and	conducting	ourselves	as	 good	and	thoughtful	neighbors	in	the	course	of	our	presence	on	your	street.

My  name  is  Alicia  Tate-Nadeau  and  I  am  honored  to  be  here  before  you  as  the  Executive Director  of  the  Chicago  Office  of  Emergency  Management  and  Communications  (OEMC) to discuss our 2017 budget.    As you know, the OEMC oversees a number of core functions that support citywide operations  and the overall safety of first responders,  residents and visitors to Chicago.  Most notably, the  OEMC  manages  the  9-1-1  Operations  Call  Center,  the  3-1-1  City  Services  Call  Center, the  Office of Emergency Management (or OEM), the civilian Traffic Management Authority and the  Public Safety Information Technology needs that support our first responders.  Many of you are  also familiar with our role in providing public safety planning and coordination across the City’s  wide array of partners.  This planning and coordination role includes everything from weekend  special events to homeland security related responsibilities.       In short – the OEMC has a diverse mission that supports the communications and coordination  needs of all our public safety partners.    Over the past  year, the  OEMC has expanded our role in providing civilian support for public  safety  first  responders.  This  year, our  Traffic  Management  Authority  absorbed  the  oversight  of school Crossing Guards, ensuring the safety of our children going to and from school. Another  significant  addition  to  the  OEMC’s  workforce  was  the  civilianization  of  the  City’s  Alternate  Response  Section.  The  Alternate  Response  Section  now  is  staffed  with  a  largely  civilian  workforce  of  OEMC  Police  Communications  Operators  (PCO  I).  This  move  supports  CPD’s  goal  of  putting  more  sworn  officers  back  on  the  beat  and  further  reinforces  the  capability  for  ARS to serve as a backup to 9-1-1 call-taking during extreme surges or in times of large scale  emergencies.     In 2016, OEMC made substantial improvements to its training for 9-1-1 Operations staff.  We  took a hard look at our training requirements with a focus on strengthening service. As a result,  new  extensive  retraining  efforts  were  implemented.  Those  efforts  include  Crisis  Intervention  Training to better respond to the calls involving mental health incidents and courtesy training to  enhance  our  staff's  skills  and  professionalism.  This  effort  has  also  resulted  in  increased  supervisor monitoring for call takers and dispatchers.      While  we  continue  to  strive  for  process  improvement  and  customer  service  satisfaction,  I  am  pleased to announce that the City of Chicago’s 9-1-1 staff has received National and State level  accolades  from  the  Association  of  Public-Safety  Communications  Officials.  This  industry   organization has awarded one of our very own as the “International Trainer of the Year” as well  as “Illinois Trainer of the Year.” This recognition highlights not only this individual’s efforts, but  the team efforts as well.      Working in partnership with DoIT and actively engaging stakeholders, we will meet the Mayor’s  vision to modernize the now 17 year old 3-1-1 technology.  Our goal is to provide convenient,  user-friendly access for residents to connect, communicate and collaborate with the City.  This  project will streamline work flow, allow for improved service delivery and tracking while also  improving  the reporting  capabilities.    All  of  these  goals  are  in  line  with  the  Mayor’s  mission  of transparency and accountability.       As always, we continue working to realize efficiencies and cost saving measures.  To this end,  OEMC was  able  to  minimize  the  increase  to  our  corporate  budget  by  utilizing  zero  based  budgeting.  This approach has meant better coordination of our Homeland Security Grant funds  to purchase and maintain new projects, software applications, and equipment.  OEMC also has  taken steps to realize significant cost savings with regard to technology.  In September, OEMC  completed several database migrations to new Dell hardware supporting 9-1-1 Operations. This  move  from  older,  expensive  legacy  hardware  will  not  only  strengthen  our  back-end  dependability  for  9-1-1  Operations  but  also  will  produce  an  estimated  $5  million  dollars  in  savings for maintenance over the next five years.         In my first few months on the job, I have seen that we have a tremendous workforce of talented  people at the OEMC and an impressive array of partnerships all committed to supporting public  safety. I look forward to continuing to assess opportunities that will strengthen this organization  and help us better meet our important mission of serving the residents and visitors to Chicago.      Again,  thank  you  Madam  Chairman  and  members  of  City  Council  and  I  look  forward  to  answering any of your questions.

Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016      Good morning Chairman Austin, Vice Chairman Ervin, members of the Committee on Budget  and Government Operations and members of the City Council. I would like to thank you for the  opportunity  to  present  to  you  the  2017  Budget  proposal  for  the  Department  of  Water  Management (DWM).       Our  mission  is  to  ensure  the  health  of  the  public  in  the  most  environmentally  and  fiscally  responsible  manner  by delivering  a  sufficient  supply  of quality  water  and  efficiently  managing  waste and stormwater.       Through our operations at the Jardine and Sawyer Water Purification Plants – the two largest  conventional  treatment  plants  in  the  world  –  DWM  purifies,  on  average,  about  800  million  gallons of water a day.  We also operate 12 pumping stations that distribute water through more  than  4,400  miles  of  water  mains.    On  the  sewer  side,  the  department  is  responsible  for  transmission of wastewater through more than 4,400 miles of sewer mains to the Metropolitan  Water Reclamation District.        We  provide  purified  water  to  more  than  2.7  million  customers  in  Chicago  and  2.67  million  customers in 125 surrounding suburbs.  On a daily basis, more than 5.3 million customers, or 42  percent of the Illinois population, depend on our infrastructure for clean, safe drinking water.        Since my confirmation in May, we have continued to meet our goals of Mayor Emanuel’s 10- year  capital  program,  now  almost  at  the  halfway  mark.    In  June,  we  hosted  ACE16  -  the  American  Water  Works  Association’s  Annual  Conference  and  Exposition  -  where  more  than  14,000 water professionals gathered to learn from one another.  At the conference I explained  why every time they went from point A to point B, whether to dinner, the airport or sightseeing,  their route might be slowed due to our construction.  We have been in every ward over the last  five  years  either  replacing  water  mains  or  sewer  mains  or  lining  structures  and  sewers.  Our  crews are hard at work to upgrade our aging infrastructure to ensure we won't have to be back  again for decades. Further, every dollar spent improving our infrastructure puts people to work,  which is a tangible benefit to our residents and our communities.        Today,  we  continue to  actively  move  closer  to  reaching  our goals  established  in  2011,  which  include:    •  Replacing 880 miles of water mains;  •  Replacing 250 miles of sewer mains;   Page -1-      Department of Water Management    2017 Budget Hearing   Remarks of Barrett B. Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016   •  Lining  more  than  470  miles  of  sewers  and  140,000  sewer  structures  to  extend  their   useful life; and   •  Converting three pumping stations from steam to electric power.      I could not be prouder of the men and women who work for the Department, helping each day to  make  our  plans  a  reality.  In  the  last  four  years  we  have  hired  or  promoted  more  than  700  employees.  Throughout  training  and  professional  development to ensure the safe and efficient execution of the capital plan.    the  Department,  we  ensure  proper      The  ability  to  provide  quality,  cost-effective  and  reliable  services  requires  a  multi-faceted  administrative effort.  That includes: incorporating facility assessments; working with the various  labor unions to achieve work rule compliance; executing competitive contracts; coordinating with  other agencies, utilities and departments; and implementing traditional and alternative funding to  avoid overburdening future generations.       We  constantly  coordinate  with  other  departments,  with  your  ward  staff,  utilities  and  other  agencies  to  identify  opportunities  for  collaboration.  The  use  of  the  latest  mapping  and  scheduling  technology,  as  well  as  monthly  coordination  meetings  between  departments  and  utilities, has contributed to an accelerated and more efficient and cost-effective program.        Earlier  this  year,  the  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  highlighted  our  Department  as  a  success story, saying that, ""In 2014, investments by … the CDWM generated nearly 20,000  total  jobs,  including  more  than  10,000  direct  construction,  water,  and  sewage  jobs…  increased regional economic output by almost $2 billion over the year.”       Infrastructure  investments  are  a  win-win  for  Chicago  and  Illinois.  The  investments  improve  environmental  quality  for  households  and  businesses;  provide  middle-class  employment  for  construction workers & the employees of water facilities; preserves our most precious resource;  and ripples into other sectors of the economy.      We  continue  to  improve  operations  and  maintenance,  which  includes  addressing  emergency  repairs and other calls for service. Work orders are being completed and closed more quickly,  resulting in a decreased backlog. In the areas of leaks and breaks, no water, water in basement,  catch basin repair requests and sewer cave-ins, our response times are down as well, as are  the number of open service requests. This increased productivity is due to the hard work of our  men and women in the field, the reduction in water main breaks and collapsed sewers due to  capital work, and by holding crews accountable to do their work efficiently and safely.

Murphy, Commissioner   October 28, 2016      The  MeterSave  Program  is  an  important  program  that  saves  water,  and  at  the  same  time,  it  saves our customers money. This year, we will exceed our installation goal of 15,000 meters.  The only way to know exactly how much water someone is using is to measure it.  With more  awareness of water use, we will all become better stewards of this great natural resource. Word  of mouth is our best marketing tool and we truly appreciate you and your staff’s assistance in  this effort as we continue to promote installation of water meters for all properties.      In 2017, our administrative goals remain the same: reform and improve where we can; cut, or  amend our approach where we must; and invest where it matters. Our construction targets for  2017 will include:   •  90 miles of water main installation  •  15,000 MeterSave meter installations  •  29 miles of sewer main installation  •  52 miles of sewer main lining  •  14,000 structure linings      At the end of our 10-year program, DWM will have invested nearly $7 billion in the improvement  of our water and sewer systems.  As Commissioner of the Department of Water Management, I  pledge to continue to work with each of you as we look at the service needs in your wards to  make the improvements necessary to maintain and improve quality of life. I am committed to  remaining  accessible  and  improving  communications  between  our  Department  and  you  and  your staff.       We  have  accomplished  much  in  2016,  and  I  look  forward  to  continuing  to  deliver  the  best  possible services to the residents of Chicago next year. Together, we will ensure that Chicago’s  water and sewer system provides high-quality service to all of our customers.       Thank you.         Page -3-      "

Currently, the risk of influenza infection is high.  Vaccination is the best way to protect against influenza infection  and all Chicagoans aged six months and older are encouraged to get vaccinated.  Chicagoans should ask their  healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  For those without a healthcare provider or whose  healthcare providers do not have the influenza  vaccine, a list of City of Chicago Fast-Track Immunization Clinics1  is available on the City website and by calling 311.  To locate the closest City of Chicago clinic or retail pharmacy,  go to www.chicagoflushots.org.     Figure 1. Number of influenza-associated intensive care unit   hospitalizations reported for Chicago residents, for current season  (2015-2016) and previous season (2014-2015), October-May.   Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has is- sued influenza testing and reporting recommendations2 .   Suspected novel and variant influenza, pediatric influen- za-associated deaths, influenza-associated ICU hospitali- zations and outbreaks of influenza-like illness in a con- gregate setting should all be reported to CDPH via IN- EDSS3.  For the week of March 13-19, 2016 (week 11),  18 influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were report- ed (Figure 1).      Since October 4, 2015, 220 influenza-associated ICU  hospitalizations have been reported; 216 were positive  for influenza A (7 H3N2, 118 (H1N1)pdm09 and 91 un- known subtype [subtyping not attempted or not all sub- types tested]) and 4 was positive for influenza B.  One  hundred fifteen (52%) were non-Hispanic Black, 124  (56%) were male, and 128 (58%) were 50 years of age or  older (median age of 54 years with a range of 3 months- 99 years).  Sixty-eight (31%) had reported lung disease  (e.g.  asthma, COPD), 56 (25%) had active cardiac dis- ease and 64 (29%) required ventilator support.  Sixteen  deaths were reported among ICU admissions.  Five out- breaks consisting of two or more confirmed cases of in- fluenza were reported in long-term care facilities.      How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   CDPH receives data from influenza surveillance sites  across Chicago, which report the total number of patient  visits seen weekly, and of those visits, the number with  influenza-like illness (ILI) (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater,  with cough or sore throat).  All hospitals in Chicago that  provide emergent care are required to report on a weekly  basis the total number of emergency department visits,  and of those visits, the number with ILI.  For the week of  March 13-19, 2016 with 10 hospitals reporting, 4.8% of  emergency department visits were due to ILI (Figure 2).      ESSENCE is an electronic syndromic surveillance system that utilizes emergency department chief complaint data sub- mitted daily by participating Chicago hospitals.  ILI activity is determined solely based on the patient’s chief complaint  and does not take into account the entire medical record, as the ILI activity reported in Figure 2 does.  Currently, 10 Chi- cago hospitals submit data to ESSENCE.  For the week of March 13-19, 2016, 2.4% of emergency department visits    were due to ILI (Figure 3).       Figure 2.

Figure 5. Percent of specimens testing positive (by RT-PCR) for  influenza by subtype as reported by local laboratories serving  Chicago hospitals, for the current season (2015-2016) October- May.         Several outpatient clinics throughout Chicago participate  in CDC’s Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network  (ILINet) by reporting on the number of patients with ILI  seen weekly.  From March 6-12, 2016, with 24 facilities  reporting, 5.9% of visits were due to influenza-like ill- ness (Figure 4).      Which influenza strains are circulating?   Data on influenza virus test results are reported by Chica- go laboratories performing influenza subtyping. For the  week of  March 13-19, 2016, with 6 laboratories report- ing, 125 of the 860 (14%) specimens tested for influenza  were positive (88 A (H1N1)pdm09, 5 A (H3N2), 25 A  [unknown subtype] and 7 influenza B).  Since October 4,  2015, 1,257 of 15,018 (8%) specimens tested for influen- za have been positive; 1,203 typed as influenza A (32  H3N2, 963 (H1N1)pdm09, 208 unknown subtype  [subtyping not attempted or not all subtypes tested]) and  54 were typed as influenza B (Figure 5).  The cumulative  percent of specimens testing positive for influenza is  lower than last season during the same time period   (Table 1).     Table 1.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s       FluView4 report provides national updates and trends re- lated to the intensity of influenza activity across the Unit- ed States, as well as detailed information on antiviral re- sistance, severity of illness, and other topics. Updates  specific to Illinois5 and Suburban Cook County6 are also  available online.  Current and archived issues of the Chi- cago Flu Update can be found on the CDPH website sec- tion Current Flu Situation in Chicago7.  In 2013, the Met- ropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council (MCHC) and  CDPH released “Stop the Spread: A Health Care Guide  to Influenza Preparedness”8.  This report provides an  overview of influenza, its impact on public health and  how hospitals can prepare for, mitigate the impact of and  respond to influenza infections and outbreaks.

Daley, Mayor      April 16, 2010   Chicago Department of Public Health  Bechara Choucair, MD, Commissioner   Figure 1. Reported number of hospitalizations associated with  confirmed or presumptive pandemic influenza A (H1N1), Chicago,  by week of specimen collection, April 2009—April 2010     What is the risk?  As of April 16, 2010, the risk of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection in Chicago remains low. Despite several  months of minimal influenza activity, the Board of Health’s Emergency Reporting Requirement1 is still in effect  for Chicago hospitals, as well as for Chicago laboratories performing influenza subtyping tests.  All Chicagoans  aged six months and older are encouraged to protect themselves from infection by getting vaccinated with the pan- demic influenza vaccine. Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.   For those without healthcare providers or whose healthcare providers do not have vaccine, vaccines are available at  City of Chicago Fast Track Immunization clinics  and neighborhood health centers; hours and loca- tions are available by calling 311.    Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   No hospitalizations associated with pandemic in- fluenza A (H1N1) have been reported in Chicago  residents for surveillance week 14 (April 4 – April  10, 2010) (figure 1).     How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   With 15 Chicago hospitals reporting, 3.2% of  emergency department visits were due to influ- enza-like illness (i.e. fever of 100°F or greater,  with cough or sore throat). In both pediatric hos- pitals and hospitals serving adults, rates have de- creased to the levels that were reported in Sep- tember 2009 (figure 2). Among four outpatient  clinics reporting for the week of April 4 – April  10, 2010, 1.0% of doctor’s office visits were due  to influenza-like illness.  This level of activity is  lower than levels seen during the same surveil- lance week during previous influenza seasons.    Which influenza strains are circulating?   For the week of April 4 – April 10, 2010, with  seven local laboratories reporting, five influenza  A-positive specimens for which subtyping was  performed were reported as presumptive pan- demic influenza A (H1N1).

The department has seen an increase in cases of confirmed canine distemper virus found in raccoons tested  after displaying abnormal neurologic signs.   The surveillance program for wildlife diseases in Cook County monitors rabies infection and other zoonotic  diseases in wildlife and it also detects trends in diseases that can be spread to companion animals, said Dr.  Donna Alexander, Administrator of the Cook County Department of Animal and Rabies Control.   “This year, 56 percent of raccoons that have been necropsied have been positive for the canine distemper  virus. This exceeds the 46 percent experienced in 2004, the last year of a distemper epidemic in pet dogs in  Cook County,” Alexander said. “The canine distemper virus occurs in the raccoon and coyote population to  varying degrees, and we believe that the numbers we have received so far this year warrant a precautionary  warning.”   The distemper virus affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous system of dogs. Symptoms can  include ocular and nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors  and seizures. Death can occur from secondary pneumonia or non-responsive seizure activity.   Pet owners should vaccinate their dogs and all dogs should be supervised while outside, even in a fenced-in  yard, to prevent contact with wild animals, Alexander said.   Additionally, some cases of the canine influenza virus have been reported in the County. As of Feb. 2, 2016,  16 cases have been confirmed in Cook County.   Last year, an outbreak of the canine flu in the region killed at least 11 dogs.   “In January and February of 2015, we had reports from veterinarians throughout the County of an increase in  canine infectious respiratory disease,” Alexander said. “The identification of the flu strain H3N2 as the culprit of  the increased severity of canine respiratory disease and deaths was not made until late March and early April.  We are testing and identifying H3N2 in many cases so far this year and pet owners should take action.”   Precautions recommended by the Alexander and the veterinary community include:     Keep all pets vaccinated against core diseases and secure additional vaccines based on the animal’s   lifestyle. See your veterinarian as to his/her recommendations for your pet. Some vaccines are required  by law.     Social events for dogs such as dog-friendly areas, training classes, grooming and boarding should be   visited with caution. Communicable diseases are transmitted through close association with other  animals. Make sure that your pet is vaccinated and that the pets involved are equally protected.  Minimize social activities with your pets and pets of unknown vaccination or health history.     Visit your veterinarian at least twice per year for health reviews including recommendations on vaccines   and intestinal parasite checks. Animals that are most susceptible to the viruses are those that are  immune-compromised by age or other illness.

Ang pagsasagawa ng aksiyon para  makaiwas ang pinakamahusay na paraan upang manatiling ligtas mula sa malulubhang panganib sa  kalusugang kaugnay sa panahon ng taglamig. Kasama sa pilas ng katotohanan (fact sheet) na ito ang mga  tip para tulungan kang maghanda para sa matinding lamig.    Paano ko mapangangalagaan ang aking sarili mula sa mga panganib ng matinding lamig?        Iwasan ang mga hindi kinakailangang biyahe sa labas. Kung makapaghihintay ang gawain  hanggang sa mas uminit ang panahon, hayaang maghintay ito.     Kung lalabas ka sa lamig, limitahan ang panahong mananatili ka sa labas. Hati-hatiin ang mas   mahahabang gawain sa mas maiikli, na may mga panahon ng pagpapahinga sa loob ng bahay sa  pagitan. Huwag hahayaan ang mga batang maglaro sa labas nang matagal.     Magsuot ng ilang patong ng maluwag, mainit na damit.    Bigyan ng espesyal na pansin na mapanatiling mainit ang iyong ulo, mga tainga, kamay at paa.   Magsuot ng sumbrero, bandana, guwantes, makakapal na medyas at mga botang pangtaglamig.  Manatiling tuyo para matulungan ang mga damit mo na panatilihin kang mas mainit.     Bigyan ng karagdagang pansin ang mga pang-araw-araw na pangangailangan ng iyong katawan.   Matulog nang sapat. Kumain ng mga pagkaing mataas sa enerhiya. Uminom ng maiinit na  inumin at sabaw upang tulungang panatilihing mainit ang yong katawan. Iwasan ang mga  inuming nakalalasing, na maaaring makasira sa iyong pagpapasiya. Pinalalaki din ng alak ang  mga daluyan ng dugo, na dahilan upang maging mas mabilis mawalan ng init ang katawan.     Ano ang maaari kong gawin sa bahay upang makapaghanda para sa matinding lamig?       Tiyakin na nasa tamang kaayusan ng paggana ang iyong pampainit (heat).    Hindi inirerekomenda ng Chicago Fire Department (CFD) ang paggamit ng mga space heater   bilang alternatibong mapagkukunan ng init.      Subaybayan ang iba't ibang lumalabas para sa mga update tungkol sa panahon (TV, Radio,   Emergency Alert System)     Magtabi nang kahit tatlong araw na dami ng inuming tubig at pagkaing de-lata/di-niluluto na   nakahanda.      Bumuo ng emergency kit na kinabibilangan ng mga ekstrang kumot, mga supply ng first aid at   gamot at isang flashlight na may mga reserbang baterya.     Huwag kalilimutan ang mga alagang hayop. Kahit ang mga aso at pusa ay kailangan ng tulong sa  pangangasiwa sa panahon ng taglamig. Ipasok sila sa loob ng bahay at siguraduhin na mayroon  silang tubig at mga kumot.      Paano ko ba matutulungan ang ibang na manatiling ligtas mula sa matinding lamig?     Magtabi ng listahan ng mga impormasyon sa pakikipag-ugnayan para sa mga kamag-anak,  kapitbahay at kaibigan, at tukuyin pareho ang pangunahin at mga alternatibong paraan ng  pakikipag-ugnayan sa bawat isa.      Kumustahin sila nang madalas, lalo na yaong matatanda, may kapansanan at/o namumuhay   mag-isa.     Alamin kung saan matatagpuan, at kung paano makikipag-ugnayan sa mga emergency service   provider tulad ng pulisya, bumbero, EMS at mga ospital.      Magtabi ng reserbang baterya at charger para sa mga mobile device.    Kung hindi ka komportableng tumingin sa isang tao, tumawag sa 311 upang humiling para sa   pagtingin ng kapakanan.      Kung wala kang access sa pampainit (heating), tumawag sa 311 para sa tulong. Maaari ka ring  pumunta sa isa sa mga sentrong painitan (warming center) ng Lungsod na matatagpuan sa  buong Chicago. Ang Garfield Center, ay matatagpuan sa 10 S. Kedzie Avenue, ay available 24  na oras sa isang araw, pitong araw sa isang linggo upang ikonekta ang mga naninirahan sa  emergency na silungan.
