By late May 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Reliable Contracting &  Equipment Company crews will begin the work to install 331 feet of new 8-inch water main in   W. Walnut Street, from N. Halsted Street to 200 feet east of N. Halsted Street and W. Walnut Street,  from N. Union Avenue to N. Desplaines Street. The old water main dates back to 1885, and needs to  be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  42nd Ward Office: 312-642-4242  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:           Crisco, the all-vegetable shortening, was introduced.    On November 11, a record cold snap (later known as The Great Blue Norther) hit the   midwest United States. Many cities broke record highs and lows on the same day.     The Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre. It was recovered in 1913.    Ground breaking began in Boston for Fenway Park.    An audience threw vegetables at actors for the first recorded time in the U.S.    Lucille Ball was born.    The South Pole was reached for the first time, by Norwegian Roald Amundsen.   LUCILLE BALL                          CAMPBELL AVE. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,616 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Campbell Avenue, from W. Marquette Road to W. 71st Street.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1911 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late September 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Campbell Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                                              CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN LONA LANE   773-471-1991       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late September  2014. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.

In early March, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 3,768 feet of  new 8-inch water main in S. Cregier Avenue (83rd Street-85th Street), in E. 84th Street (Stony Island- Cregier), and in E. 83rd Place (Stony Island-Cregier). The old water main dates back to 1915, and  needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    8th Ward Office: 773-874-3300    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

Henry]   has a conflict of interest or is otherwise not in compliance with the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance by virtue of his service for the [ABCD                                     Project]        , and his work with respect to a grant [ABCD] is submitting to the                                            [P Foundation]   .  After reviewing materials you sent to us that day, we informed you orally of our conclusion that Mr. [Henry’s] activities with respect to [ABCD] do not place him in a conflict of interest or otherwise place him in a position that is non- compliant with the Ordinance.  There are, however, several restrictions to which he is subject, and of which you should be aware.  This letter details our conclusion, and reviews those restrictions.  Mr. [Henry] is a full-time          Grants Specialist with your Division of the [C]           Department      .  He manages federal grants focusing on [topic 1]                  and [topic 2]                .  On his non-City time, he also has been serving, since           , as the first President of [ABCD].  He is not compensated for this work.   [ABCD] is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, established in             , as the funding arm of the [ABCDE]                                                              . [ABCDE] itself is also a non-profit organization, founded in part by Mr. [Henry]  in 2002.  Its mission is to help                 practitioners                                                                                                                                                                                             , to better understand and implement the principles of [topic 3]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               . [ABCDE] has sponsored conferences statewide, and conducted training and technical assistance seminars in schools and public safety  agencies.  [ABCDE’s]        Coordinating  Council  (of  which  Mr.  [Henry]  is  a member) determined that a non-profit should be created to apply for funding in support of its mission.  Hence, [ABCD]       was established in             with Mr. [Henry] as its first President.  About that time, two Coordinating Council members learned that the [P] Foundation had identified Illinois as its second statewide                 initiative location, and allocated funds to use for an Illinois “Model             Project.”   [ABCD] has applied to the Foundation for a grant of $100-125,000 per year for 3 years under this project.  The grant, if awarded, would fund: 1) more extensive  training  programs  [ABCDE]  would  conduct  for  clergy,  judges,  and “training the trainers”; 2) university-based researchers   retained by [ABCDE]      who would design a data collection and self-evaluation protocol; and 3) expansion of  [ABCDE]’s listserve and website.  Concurrently, you said, the [C] is applying to the Foundation’s        Case No. 05067.Q November 21, 2005 Page 2               Program for a $1.5 million grant to fund the Department’s [K]       initiative                                                                             . [K]       is a system of related internet-based programs designed to transmit relevant information to the public                                                                                              , and create and store [C] records online.  Mr. [Henry] has not worked on this application.  In the materials you sent us, Mr. [Henry] writes, and you have confirmed, that this [C] application, if awarded, would be funded from a source within the Foundation, namely the [U]                Program, that is different from the source to which [ABCD] has applied and which would fund its grant, namely the                   Model         Project, and that the [ABCD]  request is not “in competition with” [C’s] request.  In addition, he also writes, and you have confirmed,  that  he  has  discussed  with  you  his  participation  in  [ABCD]  and  [ABCDE],  and  the  latter’s application to the [P] Foundation.  On these facts, we conclude that, by virtue of his service for [ABCD]       and [ABCDE] and his involvement in [ABCD’s] grant application to the [P] Foundation, Mr. [Henry] does not have a conflict of interest, and has not acted in a way that does not comply with the Governmental Ethics Ordinance.  Several sections of the Ordinance are relevant to this conclusion, and there are several related restrictions on Mr. [Henry’s] conduct, of which both he and you should be aware, prospectively, regarding his [ABCD] and [ABCDE]      service.  We discuss each in order.  First, Section 2-156-020, “Fiduciary Duty,” provides that City employees, at all times in the performance of their public duties, owe a fiduciary duty to the City.  Our Board has interpreted this general provision to require that a City employee use his City position and time responsibly and in the public’s best interest, and that he give undivided loyalty to the City in the discharge of his public duties.  And, it precludes the use of City time and resources to obtain a personal benefit or promote a purely private interest. Case Nos. 96032.A; 03037.Q.  As President of  [ABCD], and as a Governing Council member of [ABCDE], Mr. [Henry] would also owe a fiduciary duty to both organizations; in the event that his fiduciary duties to the City and these organizations were to conflict, he would be required to resolve the conflict in the City’s favor. Our conclusion that Mr. [Henry] has not compromised his fiduciary duty to the City is based on the following: i) neither [ABCD] nor [ABCDE] receive funding from the City of Chicago; ii) neither [ABCD] or [ABCDE] compete directly with the City or with [C] for funding through the [P]          Foundation; and iii) Mr. [Henry] been involved in the [K]       application to the Foundation.  However, we advise you and Mr. [Henry]  to ensure that, to avoid any appearance of impropriety, as long as he serves as an [ABCD] or [ABCDE] officer or Council member, he bring to your (or his other supervisors’) attention any actual or potential grant application that [ABCD] or ABCDE] is considering that would compete with [C] or any of its grant opportunities as soon as he becomes aware of the potential competition, and that he remove himself from any further participation in the application on behalf of [ABCD] or [ABCDE] and disclose this in writing to [C] and to [ABCD] or [ABCDE].  Second,  Section  2-156-090,  “Representation  of  Other  Persons,”  prohibits  a  City  employee  from “representing”  any  person,  such  as  [ABCD]  or  [ABCDE],  before  any  City  agency  or  department  with respect to any non-ministerial action or decision of that agency or department.  Our Board has interpreted the  term  “representation”  to  include  a  broad  range  of  activities  in  which  one  person  acts  as  a spokesperson for another person, or seeks to communicate and promote the interests of one party to another, such as making personal appearances before [C] or other City agencies on behalf of another, making  telephone  contact  on  another’s  behalf  with  City  employees  and  officials,  submitting  written requests  or  proposals on their behalf to City agencies, or signing contracts on their behalf with City agencies. See Case Nos. 91047.A, 96032.A., 03037.Q.  Nothing in the facts presented to us indicates that Mr. [Henry] has represented either [ABCD] or [ABCDE] before [C] or any other City department or agency- -but we advise you prospectively that he is subject to this restriction with respect to his activities on behalf of [ABCD] and [ABCDE].    Case No. 05067.Q November 21, 2005 Page 3  Third,  Section  2-156-060, “City-Owned Property,” prohibits a City employee from the unauthorized use of City property, including City time, equipment or supplies, to carry out his duties for [ABCD] or [ABCDE] Fourth, Section 2-156-070, “Use or Disclosure of Confidential Information,” prohibits a City employee from using or revealing confidential information he has acquired during the course of his City job, whether to benefit [ABCD], [ABCDE] or any other person.  Nothing in the facts presented to us indicates that Mr. [Henry] has either engaged in the unauthorized use of City property or used or revealed  confidential information--but we again advise you prospectively that he is subject to these restrictions with respect to his activities on behalf of [ABCD] and [ABCDE].    Our conclusions are based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this letter.  If the facts presented are incorrect or incomplete, please notify us immediately, as any change in the facts may alter our conclusions. Please note that other laws or rules may apply to this situation, and that a City department may adopt and  impose  rules or policies stricter than those contained in the Governmental Ethics Ordinance.     We appreciate your bringing this matter to our attention and your and your staff’s concern to abide by the standards embodied in the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance.  If you have any further questions about this or any other matter, please contact us.    Yours very truly,  Steven I. Berlin Deputy Director  approved:  Dorothy J.
