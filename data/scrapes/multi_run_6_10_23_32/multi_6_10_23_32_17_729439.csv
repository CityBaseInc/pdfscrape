A review of the evidence presented at the hearing will aid in understanding this   decision.          Thomas O’Donnell has been a building inspector for the City of Chicago for   about eighteen years and is currently a supervising building inspector.  He has been an   inspector in what was formerly known as the Institutions Public Place of Assembly and   Licensing Unit which conducted inspections of public places of assembly.  He conducted   food and liquor licensing inspections.  He has also been an inspector and supervisor in the   strategic task force which is concerned with properties that have criminal activity.           He is familiar with the Green Dolphin at 2200 N. Ashland Avenue which he   described as a large nightclub.  His most recent inspection was June 21, 2011, the date   before the hearing.  He had also done prior inspections at that location.  Those earlier   inspections revealed issues with egress throughout the building.  There was potential   danger in the event of an emergency there was not an adequate number of doors and the   exit doors were not the proper width.  There was not a proper or adequate means of   egress.  The building’s firewall separation exceeded the maximum allowable square   footage which meant sprinklers were needed or the business needed to be   compartmentalized with firewalls.  Inadequate firewall separation would not stop the   spread of fire and smoke.  These inspections also revealed that a number of alterations      2   had been made to the property which affected egress where the exits were located without   permits or plans.  There was a large single story masonry addition added to the northwest   corner of the building.  There was a small outdoor beer garden enclosed without a permit   and a large patio area that had plans and permits but was not built according to plans   submitted to the City.  The rough approximation of the size of these additions would be   25 x 75 for the masonry addition; 30 x 40 for the beer garden and 50 x 75 for the large   patio.  These additions without permits or not being done according to plans are   dangerous because they could affect egress because the previous egress was altered and   improper materials could be used that were not flame retardant.          O’Donnell met with the owner, the owner’s son, a new architect, and an electrical   contractor at the inspection that took place the day before the hearing.  They received a   new set of plans and a demolition permit to remove a wood-framed garage, a wood deck,   and some stairs on the river bank which they did.          Most of the violations O’Donnell was concerned with had been corrected.  A   number of those things were included on the new set of plans.  There had been some   small or minor interior improvements but the more serious things have not been   corrected.  The first inspection on the ongoing building court case was in May of 2010.    O’Donnell has never recommended to the judge to increase occupancy at this location   and the building department has not recommended increased occupancy.  He would like   to see the business obtain new occupancy cards based on an approved new set plans.  The   new plans he observed at the inspection had not been approved by buildings department.       3   Those plans needed to be approved by zoning review before the submittal process at the   Department of Buildings begins.  2200 North Ashland Avenue is not in full compliance   with the buildings department at this time.          O’Donnell testified he was working off an amended complaint at this inspection.    That complaint alleged 51 or 53 violations.  From his perspective only a couple of minor   smaller improvements and changes have been addressed.  The electrical and plumbing   counts on the complaint are not in his area.  O’Donnell did not know if 48 of the 51   violations had been completed.  Over the City’s objection, Respondent’s Exhibit 1, the   First Amended Complaint for Equitable and Other Relief, was allowed in evidence.          O’Donnell agreed that various allegations in the First Amended Complaint dealt   with specific areas in the Jazz Room, the Dolphin Room (that is the West and East   Room) that have been corrected since the initial complaint.  He also agreed additional   doors were installed that solved some of the egress problems but they were installed   without a permit.  O’Donnell referred to Count 36, subparagraph 3, which asked that the   licensee “rework east exit door at Webster Street entrance vestibule so it does not drag on   the sidewalk.”  That was not done as of the inspection the day before the hearing.    Paragraph 6, asking the licensee to remove a coiled overhead shutter in the west room   also had not been done at the time of this last inspection.  While O’Donnell admitted he   had never been at the premise at night, he opined this is a primary entrance point for the   licensee’s business.  He also opined this was a relatively simple item to correct.  As to the   coiled overhead shutter door, O’Donnell explained that work could not be done in      4   minutes but could be done during hours the business is not open.  The licensee would   need plans and permit for this work and this work is included on the new plans that will   be submitted.          O’Donnell testified that he believed Judge Pileggi, by court order, had closed the   area of the tent beer garden and the outside beer garden pending new plans and a new   permit being issued.  He further stated he has been at some of the status hearings on the   building court case but not all the status hearings.  He agreed there has been some   compliance but has not seen significant compliance with the items he identified as   potentially dangerous.  There has been some compliance with regards to egress but not   with respect to the firewall.  The permits needed to do the firewall work have not been   issued.  There is a count in the amended complaint with respect to the fact that the second   egree from the second floor office was removed when one of the additions was done.    This would raise the same concern with regard to people leaving the establishment.    O’Donnell never recommended that Judge Pileggi increase occupancy and he has   concerns about occupancy relating to the danger this building presented to the public.          Patrick Haran has been a plumbing inspector for the City of Chicago for nine   years.  He inspects plumbing systems to verify it is up to code, verify it has proper water   service, and verify it has the proper water heater.  With respect to commercial buildings   that need additional fixtures he ensures the fixtures are installed properly, that they be   handicap accessible and verify there are the proper amount of toilets and sinks.  He has   participated in inspections for the Green Dolphin bar at 2200 N. Ashland Avenue, the last      5   inspection being performed the date before the hearing.  He inspected as early as May of   2010.  He found several violations such as inadequate amount of toilet sinks, hand sinks   and mop sink.  There were additional fixtures that had been installed without a permit.    There were no handicap facilities and an inadequate number of lavatories with improper   water service.  There was also a problem with the mop sink which was potentially   dangerous and hazardous.          The inspection the day before the hearing revealed that a plumbing permit was   pulled earlier this year.  Some of the violations had been addressed, but the main   violations concerning adding sufficient plumbing fixtures, upgrading the water service   and adding handicapped accessibility to the bathroom remained.  With the permit the   licensee did install hand sinks behind the bar but they were installed improperly.  The   drain was tied into the downspout underneath the floor when it should have been   connected to the sewer.  This could cause the release of sewer gas in the room after it   rains.  The bathrooms have not come into compliance and he discussed with the architect   at the inspection the number of fixtures that would be needed.  At present the corrected   violations would be service work, not major corrections and the plumbing counts left   open are more important than what has been done.          Haran acknowledged being present for some of the status conferences in building   court but could not recall a status on May 30, 2011, and did not recall Judge Hughes    asking if he had concerns about dangerous conditions on the premises.  He added there is   nothing dangerous now but added if the traps are sucked out of the sink it could cause      6   allowed the licensee to continue operation under the occupancy limits set out in that   order.          This Commission is concerned that it may appear that the License Appeal   Commission is being used by the City to get a ruling giving it the relief it did not get in   the Circuit Court.  Questions of collateral estoppel and/or res judicata might be properly   argued.  The fact is that it was the licensee that filed this appeal conveying jurisdiction on   this Commission.  Neither party has objected to the jurisdiction of this Commission or to   how this Commission has proceeded in this case.         It is the decision of this Commissioner that the issue of non-renewal for suitability   is not the same as the issue of whether the conditions of the property provide an imminent   threat to the health, safety and welfare of the occupants and the public.  The evidence   presented by the City meets its burden that the premises are not suitable for renewal.  The   decision of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner to Refuse to Renew the liquor   licenses for 2200 N. Ashland Avenue LLC is affirmed.                                                                    Dennis M. Fleming   Chairman    12

In mid-November, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 3,956  feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Halmin Avenue (56th Street-58th Street) and in W. 57th Place  (Pulaski-Central Park). The old water main dates back to 1913, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    23rd Ward Office: 773-582-4444    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.
