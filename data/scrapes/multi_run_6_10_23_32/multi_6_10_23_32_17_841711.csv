Register now at www.cdphlms.com   Figure 1. Weekly reported percent of emergency department visits  attributed to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current  season (2010-2011) and previous season, October-May.   What is the risk?  The risk of influenza infection in Chicago is low.  Locally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza is  less than one percent, one of the lowest levels seen all season with only one specimen testing positive for influenza A.    This is the second consecutive week since December that no influenza B viruses were detected.  The influenza vaccine  protects against both influenza A and B.  Vaccine is available in doctor’s offices, retail pharmacies, CDPH Neighbor- hood Health Centers, and immunization walk-in clinics.  A list of CDPH clinics is available on the City of Chicago  website1 and by calling 311.  The last Chicago Flu Update of the 2010-2011 influenza surveillance season will be is- sued on 5/27/2011.  CDPH will continue to conduct influenza surveillance throughout the summer.  Updates will re- sume in October 2011 for the 2011-2012 season.     Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   No influenza-associated ICU admissions was re- ported for surveillance week 19 (May 8-14, 2011).   This is the third consecutive week where no ICU  admissions were reported.  Since October, a total of  98 influenza-associated ICU admissions of Chicago  residents have been reported to CDPH.2  No deaths  were reported for surveillance week 19.  A total of  fifteen deaths have been reported so far this season  (both ICU and non-ICU) including two in pediatric  patients.       How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   For the week of May 8-14, 2011, with 17 hospitals  reporting, 3.6% of emergency room visits were due  to ILI (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with cough or  sore throat). This is similar to levels reported during  the same surveillance week in 2010 and the third  consecutive week that a decrease has been noted  (Figure 1).         Which influenza strains are circulating?   With 7 laboratories reporting, 1 (<1%) of 207 speci- mens tested was positive for influenza in week 19,  subtyped as influenza A (H1N1).  No specimens  tested positive for influenza B (Figure 2).    Where can I get more information?        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  FluView3 report provides national updates and  trends related to the intensity of influenza activity  across the United States, as well as detailed infor- mation on antiviral resistance, severity of illness,  and other topics. Updates specific to Illinois4 and  Suburban Cook County5 are also available online.     1http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/clinic/svcs/find_a_clinic.html  2 https://www.chicagohan.org/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=28960&folderId=24344&name=DLFE-144.pdf   3http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/; 4 http://www.idph.state.il.us/flu/fluupdate10-11.htm  5 http://www.cookcountypublichealth.org/flu_current_situation   Figure 2.

Jamal Bunni, President   Applicant (Package Goods)  for the premises located at   2353 North Narragansett Avenue             v.                                              Local Liquor Control Commission     Department of Business Affairs & Licensing   Mary Lou Eisenhauer, Acting Director                ORDER    CHAIRMAN FLEMING=S OPINION JOINED BY COMMISSIONER SCHNORF     The applicant applied for a Packaged Goods liquor license for the premises located at   2353 N. Narragansett.  After an investigation was conducted, Mary Lou Eisenhauer, then the   Acting Director of the Local Liquor Control Commission, denied the application on August 15,   2008.  The reason for the denial was her determination that the issuance of this license would   violate Section 4-60-090 (a) of the Municipal Code which states:    No license for the sale of alcoholic liquor shall be   shall be issued to any person, partnership, association  or corporation for the sale or dispensing at retail of   alcoholic liquor on any premises used as a filling station.                                 1   A timely appeal of this decision was filed at the License Appeal Commission.  This   matter proceeded to hearing on December 3, 2008, and was taken under advisement.       Bryan Knipper testified that he was the Senior Business Consultant for the Department of   Business Affairs and Licensing that handled this application.  He recommended that the package   goods license be denied.  He made this recommendation in part based on his review of the   License Application Investigative Summary, in evidence as Applicant=s Exhibit #1, which stated   the business is occupying part of a Citgo gas station.  Other factors considered on this denial   included the fact that the location of this business and the Citgo station were part of a singular   standing building on the same tract of land, lack of separate parking and the fact that gas pumps   were in front of the premises proposed to be used for the package goods store.  He stated he   agreed with the memo prepared by James Terrell, Applicant=s Exhibit #3.  That memo stated the   application should be denied because the applicant was Aattempting to open a business selling   liquor within a free standing building that was clearly constituted as a filling station and is in fact   currently operating as a filling station.  Changing the address and putting up an interior wall is   merely attempting to squirt the intent of the law to keep the sale of liquor products away from   the proximity of servicing motor vehicles.@      Jamal Bunni is the owner of 50% of MGDN Enterprises.  He owns the property located at   Fullerton and Narragansett.  The applicant=s corporation which was created on May of 2007, has   a two year lease for a portion of the property at Narragansett and Fullerton.  A separate    corporation has a lease for the portion of the property occupied by Citgo and has a franchise                       2   agreement with Citgo.  The building was originally empty space that was to be used as a Medical   Center.  It was remodeled for use by Citgo and Citgo painted this entire building.  Later, the area   where the packaged goods would be sold was built out with a wall separating it from Citgo at a   cost of $150,000.  The wall was built to allow for the sale of alcohol and permits were obtained   for the work.  His intent was to comply with the Municipal Ordinances.      The geographical layout of the site is not in dispute.  There is a Citgo station from a   portion of the building.  Apparently at one time it controlled the entire building.  A license to sell   liquor would not issue to any entity operating the Citgo station since those premises are being   used as a filling station.  The present layout contains two storefronts.  One is for the operation of   the Citgo station and mini-mart and one is the proposed site of a packaged goods location.    Presently there is a wall dividing these two storefronts and there are separate leases for each   storefront.  While there was testimony that the gas pumps from the Citgo station are in front of   the proposed site of the packaged goods store, the pictures seem to indicate that is not the fact.        This case comes down to this Commission=s definition of the word premises.  Merriam-   Webster gives two definitions of the word as related to this issue.  They are:    A.   B.   A tract of land with the buildings thereon    A building or part of a building usually with its appurtenances.    If one applies definition A, the license should be denied since the tract of land includes a portion   of a building used as a filling station.  If one applies definition B, the restriction on the license   would not apply since one would focus on the use of the specific part of the building.                        3   Under the specific evidence produced in this case, it is the decision of this Commissioner   that it is appropriate to use definition B.  There are two separate premises existing in the building   at Fullerton and Narragansett.  The premises in which packaged liquor goods would be sold are   not being used by a filling station.  The prohibition set out in Section 4-60-070(a) of the   Municipal Code does not apply to those premises.  The decision of the Local Liquor Control   Commission denying the issuance of a package goods license to MGDN Enterprise, Ltd. for the   premises located at 2353 North Narragansett Avenue is reversed.       COMMISSIONER KOPPEL=S CONCURRING OPINION    This Commissioner concurs with Chairman Fleming=s decision.  It is quite clear that the   area where the packaged goods liquor license would be sold is separate from the Citgo station.    They are definitely two different and separate operations and storefronts.  The license should be   granted.                                                    4   THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED That the said order or action of the Local      Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago be and the same hereby is REVERSED.     Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a Petition for Rehearing may be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order  is deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the  Circuit Court, the Petition for Rehearing must be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days  after service of this order as such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

6980`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/lac/2010lacrulings/10LA05.pdf`Success`Success`24`10`Not a fillable PDF.`On March 24, 2010, Local Liquor Control Commissioner Gregory Steadman issued an   amended denial letter.  That amended denial letter incorporated the original law enforcement   basis for denial and also alleged the application was denied because the applicant has been   charged with committing a battery, with failure to cooperate with the police on November 29,   2009, concerning the battery investigation and with a happy hour violation committed on   February 10, 2010.  These charges are pending before the Local Liquor Control Commission in   case 10 LR 13.       Since this is a denial of an application the issue before this Commission is to determine   de novo the propriety of the denial of this incidental activity application for a license at this   address.  In order to better understand this decision, a summary of the proceedings which   consists of over 378 pages of transcript and over 27 exhibits is appropriate.       Prior to the start of evidence the City was given leave to amend the amended denial letter   to reflect that the date of the alleged battery was September 7, 2009.  This document is in   evidence as City’s Exhibit 8.  City’s Exhibits 1 through 7 were allowed in evidence as the    documents relied on by Norma Reyes and Gregory Steadman when they made their decision to   deny this application.       Mr. Maragos made a request that this Commission enter a pre-hearing order striking   portions of the amended denial letter referencing the Commission of a battery by the applicant as   a basis for denial.  This request was made on the basis that the criminal charges were disposed of                       2   favorably in Circuit Court.  The request was denied.        Also, prior to the start of evidence the parties entered into a stipulation that the Ole   Lounge at 2812 N. Lincoln Avenue has no prior disciplinary history since its inception in 2006,    aside from the charges pending under Case 10 LR 13.      Thomas Jenkins has been a Chicago Police Officer for eleven years and is presently a   tactical officer in the 19th District.  In late 2009, District Commander Kenny assigned him to   conduct a liquor license investigation regarding Tolgano, Inc., at 1834 West Montrose Avenue.    At the end of his investigation he recommended that Commander Kenny not authorize the liquor   license.  As part of his investigation he did a name check on Mitch Gundogdu and became aware   there was an investigative alert with probable to arrest for a battery sexual criminal assault.  An   investigative alert is issued by a detective and if the alert is with probable cause to arrest it   means a complaint has issued and the person will be arrested.  Jenkins called Mitch personally   and scheduled an appointment at the 19th District for November 28, 2009, at noon.  Mitch did not   appear for this meeting.  Jenkins called Mitch on November 29, and told him he needed to come   in.  Mitch replied he could not.  Jenkins told Mitch the liquor license application would not be   approved and Mitch said he did not care.  Mitch did say he wanted to send in a lawyer or a friend   but Jenkins insisted Mitch appear.  There were two conversations between Jenkins and Mitch   which Jenkins described as friendly, not hostile.  Jenkins felt that Mitch did not cooperate with   the investigation.  Jenkins was not involved in the eventual arrest of Mitch.                           3   On cross Officer Jenkins stated he was assigned this investigation by Commander Kenny   about November 25 or 26.  After Jenkins became aware of the investigative alert he contacted   Michele Wood who was the detective on the case who confirmed the investigative alert with   probable cause to arrest was still valid.  Jenkins did not know the investigative report was   initiated on September 26, 2009.  Detective Wood did not tell Jenkins what happened after the   investigative alert was issued and Jenkins was not aware if he was the first officer to speak to   Mitch.  He called Mitch on November 27 from a phone at the 19th District.  The number he   called from was (312) 744-5983.  Jenkins recalled Mitch said he would send a friend or lawyer   in but was not sure if Mitch said he had a partner.  Jenkins never contacted Mitch=s attorney prior   to writing his report that Mitch was uncooperative.  Jenkins acknowledged he had been trained in   the proper legal procedures involving criminal investigative alerts.  Jenkins also stated Mitch did   speak to him despite his Fifth Amendment rights.  Jenkins had done liquor license application   investigations for two years.  Jenkins initially went to the location of the applicant at 1834 W.   Montrose but it was papered up.  He did not ask anyone to open the door.  Jenkins stated he is   not aware of standard operating procedures for liquor license applications performed by the   Department of Revenue.  His investigation was an investigation for the district commander and   not done for the liquor commission.  He does not need to follow the Department of Revenue   procedures.  His was informal and he had Mitch pick the date and time for him to come in.  He   was doing a liquor license investigation for the district commander pursuant to the district   commander=s receipt of a letter from DBA about this application.  He is not involved in any   police investigation relative to revenue.  His investigations deal with calls for service and doing   name checks.  He deals only with police issues.  He is not aware of the rules and regulations of                       4   investigations before the DBA or the Department of Revenue.       Witnesses were taken out of order to expedite the proceedings.   This decision will   review the City=s case and then the defense witnesses.       John Kenny has been the 19th District Commander since March of 2008.  That district   includes 1834 W. Montrose Avenue.  His role in liquor license applications is to make a   recommendation of whether the license be approved or disapproved after he reviews the findings   of a member of his staff who has conducted a preliminary investigation.  He assigned Officer   Jenkins and Philbin  to investigate the application for 1834 W. Montrose Avenue. They   submitted a summary of their investigation to him on November 29, 2009.  Kenny reviewed that   summary and recommended the application be denied because the applicant failed to cooperate   in the preliminary investigation.  He identified City=s Exhibit 10, as a copy of his report created   on December 7, 2009.  Kenny is familiar with the Ole Lounge which is located within his district   at 2812 N. Lincoln.  He is aware Mr. Gundogdu is also the president of the Ole Lounge.  Kenny   is aware there had been an investigative alert issued regarding an incident that occurred at the   Ole Lounge.  Kenny is aware from Officer Jenkins’ report the Mr. Gundogdu did not appear at a   scheduled meeting with Officer Jenkins.  Kenny stated in his opinion the applicant did not   cooperate with the liquor license application process.  This lack of cooperation influenced his   decision to disapprove the application because it prevented his officers from doing a complete   investigation of the premises and the applicant.  Commander Kenny identified City=s Exhibit 11,   as a printout of calls to or from the address of 2812 N. Lincoln from January 1, 2009, and                       5   January 12, 2010.  It reflects 19 calls for service.  This includes five calls for batteries and two   calls for criminal sexual assault.       On cross Commander Kenny stated that his December 7, 2009, objection set out that Aat   this time,@ December 7, 2009, he disapproved of the application Adue to the fact that the owner   has an investigation No. 299961929.@  Kenny repeated that his disapproval was based on the   applicant=s refusal to come in to be interviewed.  The 19 calls for service was not a point of his   decision.  Kenny never stated in writing to anyone that Mitch Gundogdu Afailed to cooperate   with the police on this investigation alert.@  This was not his investigation.  His liquor license   report states either approve or denial and he attached the investigating officer=s report.  After   reviewing police reports Commander Kenny explained Police Officer Traci Tokarz wrote the   initial report but that the detectives from Area 3 would have done the investigation.  Kenny   never discussed this report with Officer Tocarz or Detective Wood.  The report from Officer   Jenkins indicated the applicant failed to come in for an investigative interview and that   constituted failure to cooperate.  Kenny indicated again the basis of his recommendation to   disapprove was a failure to cooperate with the liquor license investigation.  Kenny did not   consult with either Officer Jenkins or Philbin and did not consult with anyone as to what   constituted failure to cooperate.  Kenny was not aware that Mitch voluntarily submitted himself   with his attorney to be arrested and booked at the 19th District.  He is not aware of the disposition   of that case.            The City rested its case.                  6      Thomas Kamykowski is the Executive Director of the Ravenswood Chamber of   Commerce. That organization is located at 1756 W. Wilson which is about four blocks from the   applicant=s location.  The chamber has about 125 members and its purpose is to support   businesses in the Ravenswood community, to foster a reliable business environment in the area   and to try to contribute back to community.  It sponsors movies and concerts in the Chase Park   and holiday parties at local schools and parks.  The area around 1844 Wilson has gone through   hard times over the last couple of years.  The Brown Line AL@ station was closed for rehab for an   entire year and then there was a huge sinkhole.  There has also been street repair and seven   projects going on.  In the last six months their area has started to become very viable.  A   business like Wolcott=s would adhere to the changing character of that stretch of Montrose.  The   witness knows Mitch and Wolcott=s from stopping by to view the work going on.  The previous   site of Wolcott=s was an eyesore with employees getting into disputes with neighbors.  It was a   pizza place that disposed of grease improperly.  After the pizza business vacated the premises it   was vacant and attracted homeless people and marked by graffiti.  Wolcott=s would be an asset to   the community.  It would prevent crime in the neighborhood because it would conform to the   changing character of Montrose and would not be attracting the type of folks typically associated   with crime.  The witness identified Licensee=s Exhibit 1, as a letter he wrote in support of this   license.       On cross the witness stated he lives a couple of miles away but works in the   neighborhood and has worked in the neighborhood since January of 2000.  He does not know                       7   complaints about the Ole Lounge and feels Mitch is a good manager and the lounge is good for    the community.  Based on his knowledge about the operation of the Ole Lounge he feels Mitch   would run a good establishment at the new place.       On cross the witness stated he went to the Ole Lounge about once a month.  Mitch told   him about charges pending against the Ole Lounge and also told him of allegations of a battery   that occurred at the Ole Lounge.         Ronald Neville has been a licensed attorney since January of 1971 and has been   practicing civil and criminal litigation in private practice since 1976.  He first met Mitch in 2008   when he represented Mitch in a civil matter with an insurance company.  That matter was settled   in August of 2009 but final procedures went on until October of 2009.  In September of 2009   Mitch told him a Chicago Police Officer called and wanted to speak with him.  The officer had   not told Mitch why the officer wanted to meet him.  Neville advised Mitch not to talk to the   police officer until they found out what the issue was.  He further told Mitch under the Illinois    United States Constitutions he was not obligated to speak to a police officer about anything.    Mitch was told to tell any police officers that called him that Neville represented him and they   wanted to know what the subject matter was.  On October 2, 2009, Neville called an Officer   Torres at 312-744-0570, which was the number for the 19th District.  Officer Torres was not   available and Neville left a message on an answering machine for Officer Torres.  In that   message Neville told Torres that he was calling in response to Torres= call to Mitch and further   told Torres he was Mitch=s attorney and they needed to talk about subject matter of Torres=                       13

Commissioner       cc: Alderman Daniel Solis        25th Ward                                                     Do you wonder what was happening in 1886?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                 SIGMUND FREUD              Pharmacist Dr. John Stith Pemberton invented a carbonated beverage that would be   named “Coca-Cola”.  In New York Harbor, President Grover Cleveland dedicated the Statue of Liberty.       Baseball Hall of Famer Ty Cobb was born.    Karl Benz patented the first successful gasoline-driven automobile.    The first Tournament of Roses was held in Pasadena, California.    Sigmund Freud opened practice in Vienna.    The London Times published the world’s very first classified ad.                  PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,899 feet of 8-inch water main in  S. Oakley Avenue, from W. Cermak Road to W. 24th Street, and in W. 22nd Place, from S.  Western Avenue to S. Oakley Avenue.           Reason: The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1886, and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Work starts shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in late July (restoration will  follow in late August). This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected  developments in the street, or other circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our  schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Oakley Avenue and W. 22nd Place without  interruption, but we will have to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   ALDERMAN DANIEL SOLIS   773-523-4100   3-1-1         312-742-1029   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July.  Restoration will follow in late August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

The Chicago Infrastructure  Trust will allow us to consider transformative infrastructure projects and build a world- class infrastructure for our city.”    Mayor Emanuel announced the Trust on March 1, in an event in which he was joined by  former President Bill Clinton.     Through a new program called Retrofit Chicago, energy efficiency work will be the first  series of investments made by the Trust, pending approval by the City Council. By  aggregating energy efficiency projects across the City and its sister agencies and tapping  into private investment, the Trust will accelerate retrofit projects that would otherwise not  have been possible. The City currently spends $170 million annually on energy  consumption. This project will reduce energy costs by more than $20 million annually,  create nearly 2,000 construction jobs, and remove the equivalent of more than 30,000 cars’  worth of emissions from the atmosphere annually.                  The Chicago Infrastructure Trust will provide advantaged financing, enabling each project  to customize a financing structure using taxable or tax-exempt debt, equity investments  and other forms of support. Each project will be coordinated with the City and its sister  agencies’ long-term plan for transformational infrastructure investments.      The Chicago Infrastructure Trust was created in concert with the private sector, non-profit  organizations, and union leaders. An amended ordinance was submitted this week, which  calls for one Alderman to be on the Trust’s board, and clarifies that the Trust will be  completely subject to FOIA, Open Meetings laws, and the City’s ethics ordinance.     The Trust will require City Council approval for all projects, and will operate as a Non- Profit organization as it seeks projects.      The Trust passed by a vote of 41-7.     # # #

By late September 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 6,273 feet of new 12-inch water main in S. South  Chicago Avenue, from E. Marquette Road to E. 73rd Street. The old water main dates back to 1890,  and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  5th Ward Office: 773-324-5555  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635        Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.   Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
