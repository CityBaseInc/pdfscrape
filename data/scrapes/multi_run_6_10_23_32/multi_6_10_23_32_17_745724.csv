On February 28, 2014, Officer Little filed with the Police Board a request for Police   Board review of this suspension. On March 6, 2014, Officer Little filed with the Police Board a   memorandum delineating specific reasons for which the review was requested.    The Executive Director of the Police Board assigned this matter to Hearing Officer   Jacqueline A. Walker.  Hearing Officer Walker reviewed the investigation file and submitted a   written report to the Police Board.     The members of the Police Board reviewed the Summary Report of the investigation file,   the recommendations of Command Channel Review and the Chief of the Bureau of Internal   Affairs, Officer Little’s memorandum, and Hearing Officer Walker’s report.  Hearing Officer   Walker made an oral report to and conferred with the Police Board before it rendered its findings   and decision.    POLICE BOARD FINDINGS   The Police Board of the City of Chicago, as a result of its consideration of this matter,   finds and determines that:   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2320  Police Officer Kerry Little  Findings and Decision                 1.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Kerry Little, Star No. 15888,   violated Rule 24 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the   allegation is therefore sustained.   On October 19, 2011, Police Officer Kerry Little failed to report to the Medical Services  Section for a follow-up appointment as scheduled, and did not report or contact the Medical  Services Section until November 28, 2011.        Sergeant Eileen Guest submitted a report indicating that Officer Little, who was on the   medical roll, was scheduled to report to the Medical Services Section on October 19, 2011, for a   follow-up appointment, and that he failed to appear.  Sergeant Guest further reported that Officer   Little did not contact the Medical Services Section until November 28, 2011.  Sergeant Rodney   Smith of the Medical Integrity Unit confirmed Sergeant Guest’s report.      Additionally, on November 28, 2011, Officer Little was decertified from the Medical   Roll because of the 41 days between October 19, 2011 and November 28, 2011, when he failed   to appear at the Medical Services Section.  Officer Little was subsequently recertified on   December 6, 2011, when he submitted the necessary documentation.    Officer Little stated that he was the victim of an armed robbery just after midnight on   October 19, 2011.  He also stated that he phoned the Medical Services Section at 7:32 that   morning and left a detailed voice-mail message for Officer Neary, and that he never heard back   from anyone in the Medical Services Section. The Board finds that neither of these   circumstances justifies Officer Little’s failure to contact the Medical Services section for 41   days.      2.   The Police Board has considered the facts and circumstances of Officer Little’s   conduct, and his complimentary and disciplinary histories.        2   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2320  Police Officer Kerry Little  Findings and Decision                 Chicago police officers receive full pay and benefits for a period of absence from work   due to illness or injury, provided such illness or injury is certified by the Medical Services   Section. Officer Little shirked his duty to report promptly to the Medical Services Section,   thereby undermining the integrity of the process for providing officers with this important   benefit.  His failure to report is a serious offense, and the fifteen-day suspension recommended in   this case is not unwarranted.        POLICE BOARD DECISION      The Police Board of the City of Chicago hereby adopts the findings set forth herein by   the following vote:      By a vote of 8 in favor (Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William  F. Conlon, Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, and Elisa Rodriguez) to 0  opposed, the Board sustains the allegation that Police Officer Kerry Little violated Rule 24.     As a result of the foregoing, the Board, by a vote of 7 in favor (Carney, Foreman, Conlon,   Eaddy, Fry, McKeever, and Rodriguez) to 1 opposed (Ballate), hereby determines that cause   exists for suspending Police Officer Kerry Little from his position as a police officer with the   Department of Police, and from the services of the City of Chicago, for a period of fifteen (15)   days.   NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the suspension of Police   Officer Kerry Little, Star No. 15888, for a period of fifteen (15) days is sustained.    This disciplinary action is adopted and entered by a majority of the members of the   Police Board: Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, William F. Conlon, Michael Eaddy, Rita A.   Fry, Susan L. McKeever, and Elisa Rodriguez.         3   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2320  Police Officer Kerry Little  Findings and Decision                 DATED AT CHICAGO, COUNTY OF COOK, STATE OF ILLINOIS, THIS 15th DAY   OF MAY, 2014.             Attested by:   /s/ Demetrius E. Carney  President          /s/ Max A. Caproni  Executive Director        4         Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2320  Police Officer Kerry Little  Findings and Decision                 DISSENT   I dissent from the Decision of the majority of the Board with regard to the penalty.  Based   on the facts of this case and the lack of any prior discipline of Officer Little, I find that the 15-  day suspension is not warranted, and I vote to reduce the length of the suspension.             /s/ Melissa M. Ballate                                         RECEIVED A COPY OF     THESE FINDINGS AND DECISION    THIS _____ DAY OF _________________, 2014.      ____________________________________  GARRY F.

In August, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 2,626 feet of new  8-inch water main in W. Roscoe Street (Ashland-Southport) and in N. Greenview Avenue (Roscoe- Belmont). The old water main dates back to 1891, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    44th Ward Office: 773-525-6034    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner      Genwmnot03032016

WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 790 feet of 12-inch  water main in W. Kinzie Street, from N. Carpenter Street to N. Sangamon Street, and N. Morgan  Street, from 25’ North of W. Kinzie Street to 63’ South of W. Kinzie Street.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1885 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by early September 2012. Restoration (to be completed by the Chicago  Department of Transportation) will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other  factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Kinzie Street and N. Morgan Street outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                                      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main installation is slated to conclude in  early September 2012. Restoration (to be completed by the Chicago Department of  Transportation) will follow. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,555 feet of 8-inch water main in S. State Street, from E. 101st  Street to E. 105th Street, and in W. 104th Place, from S. State Street to 1,100 feet west of S.  Wentworth Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1907, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Austin’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Carrie Austin               34th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                     Do you wonder what was happening in 1907? That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:              For the first time, a ball dropped in Times Square in New York to signal the new year.    President Theodore Roosevelt shook a record 8,513 hands in one day.    The first cabs with taxi meters began operating in London.    Finland became the first European country to give women the right to vote.    The automatic washer and dryer were introduced.    Oklahoma became the 46th State.    Actor John Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa.                                                 WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,555 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. State Street, from E. 101st Street to E. 105th Street, and in W. 104th Place, from  S. State Street to 1,100 feet west of S. Wentworth Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1907 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late October. Final restoration will follow in the spring of 2015. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN CARRIE AUSTIN   773-928-6961                           FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late October. Final  restoration will be completed in the spring of 2015. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

The Department seeks to minimize  the burden of the audit process and improve the efficient use of audit resources by  implementing a program whereby taxpayers take an active role in the audit process.      The purpose of the managed audit is to provide a thorough education to the taxpayer on each  tax type covered by the program with less of a disruption to the taxpayer than a standard  audit might involve.  Our goal is to create a relationship with each taxpayer whereby that  taxpayer’s overall compliance with all City taxes is improved.      A managed audit is an audit performed by the taxpayer, under the direction and guidance of  the Department of Finance, pursuant to a formal written agreement outlining the duties and  obligations of each party.  The auditor will provide specific written instructions for the  taxpayer and will review the work of the taxpayer.  This program is an alternative to the  standard audit and provides incentives for taxpayers.  The program will reduce the average  hours required to complete an audit and will assist the Department in administering and  enforcing taxes more efficiently.      This program will provide benefits to the taxpayer and the Department.  By allowing  taxpayers the opportunity to be directly involved in the review of their books and records,  they will better understand the specific applications of the taxes to their operations, possibly  identify operational processes that require modification, and receive penalty and/or interest  waivers on the resulting liability.  The Department will benefit from the program by freeing  auditor time to pursue other enforcement matters with other taxpayers.                                                   Managed Audit Process    Department of Finance management will evaluate cases, individually, to identify specific  cases for managed audits.    Auditors will conduct opening conferences with business representatives to understand  accounting systems and available records, determine whether the taxpayer is a candidate for a  managed audit. And discuss the managed audit process and procedures with the authorized  business representatives to insure that they understand what is required and what benefits  they will receive.    Auditors will prepare a managed audit agreement, including a detailed explanation of the  specific audit steps of the audit that the taxpayer will be completing establish deadlines  providing specific dates by which the taxpayer will have its audit work completed, present  the agreement to the audit supervisor for his/her approval before presenting it to the taxpayer,  and discuss processes and procedures for requesting additional time to complete audit work.      Auditors will review and/or test taxpayers’ worksheets and summary schedules.    The completed audit will be submitted for supervisor review as if it were a regular audit, and  it will go through the normal review and point clearance process.     Auditors will prepare amended returns and validate liability for each period under review.    Auditors will process all penalty and interest waivers pursuant to the Managed Audit  Agreement.      A closing conference will be held with the taxpayer where copies of the audit file are  provided to the taxpayer along with amended returns for approval and authorized signatures  of the taxpayer.      Although full payment of audit-determined liability is expected, payment plans can be  entered.  Although the program provides for interest waivers on audit determined liabilities,  interest accrues throughout the payment plan term on the full amount of tax outstanding.                                             Audit Methodology, Sampling and Workpapers    The methodology used to compute or otherwise determine the amount due or level of  compliance will be discussed before any detailed work is undertaken.  The methodology will  be documented and agreed upon before the detailed work is started to insure that both parties  understand what work needs to be done and how it will be summarized.  The approach used  will be very similar to that used by the Department during the course of any other audit.   Sample periods can be utilized when circumstances warrant and actual reviews of entire audit  periods can also be conducted if necessary.  Sample periods will be identified and agreed  upon by both parties.    The Department will provide workpaper templates for use in documenting the audit findings.   These templates are intended to provide taxpayers with a guide of how the detail is to be  summarized.  Fluctuations from the standard templates are acceptable but should be  discussed before hand.  The objective is to have the audit work summarized in such a manner  that the auditor can efficiently review the work to verify that the liabilities, if any, have been  computed correctly.  If the taxpayer has suggestions or recommendations that it believes will  achieve the objective yet require less time, those concerns should be raised directly with the  auditor.      At the conclusion of the detailed work, the auditor will meet with the taxpayer to review the  schedules compiled and perform a limited verification of the records reviewed and  summarized.  Once satisfied that all testing was done to his/her satisfaction, the auditor will  present the file to his/her supervisor for final review.  No payments are required or expected  until after the supervisor has accepted and approved the audit.  In the event that something is  incomplete or not completed to the satisfaction of the supervisor, the auditor may need to  revisit the business to obtain explanations or additional records.  After supervisory approval  has been secured, amended tax returns will be generated using the audit-determined findings,  and taxpayers will sign and file those returns, which will include all agreed penalty and  interest waivers.  Settlements must be either within pre-approved parameters or specifically  approved by the appropriate supervisors within the Departments of Finance and Law.                                                 Managed Audit Agreements    A managed audit agreement (MAA) is an agreement between the Department of Finance and  a taxpayer that specifies an agreed-upon methodology for calculating and remitting a tax.   Many state and local taxing jurisdictions across the United States are utilizing some form of  MAA to improve their efficiency and overall effectiveness.      Increased demand for greater efficiencies in government has prompted many taxing  authorities to consider alternatives to improve overall compliance levels.  The traditional  audit has been the most common tool used in tax enforcement.  The MAA will enhance that  process by involving taxpayers in their own audits.  In addition to an elimination and/or  reduction of penalties and interest, taxpayers will also benefit from an MAA because it will  allow them an opportunity to analyze their own business operations and possibly identify  areas where changes can be made to make their own operations more effective and compliant  with City taxes.      Eligibility for program    A taxpayer’s inclusion in an MAA is based on its willingness and ability to participate.   Generally the Department will consider entering into an MAA with taxpayers who have  maintained an acceptable system of business records, cooperated with any previous tax  enforcement efforts of the Department and demonstrated a willingness and ability to comply  with the tax laws.      Taxpayers with whom the Department may decline to enter into an MAA include those who  have failed to cooperate in past audits, those who have failed to remedy improper reporting  practices identified in a prior audit, those who have been or currently are the subject of  ongoing criminal investigations, or those who maintain poor internal controls or inadequate  systems of business records.      The Department will negotiate in a spirit of cooperation for a methodology and agreement  that will meet the needs of both parties.                                 Chicago Department of Finance   MANAGED AUDIT AGREEMENT                This managed audit agreement (MAA”) is entered into between the Chicago Department of  Finance (“Department”) and                                                                                (“Taxpayer”),  to conduct a managed audit of the ____________________________Tax for the period   of                                 through                          .          The parties agree to the following:    1.  The Taxpayer will review appropriate books and records as determined by the audit plan.  This review will identify unreported transactions and/or receipts for the above period and  should be completed within                   days from the signing of this agreement.   Amendments to this time frame during the course of the audit may be necessary to facilitate  completion.  All records, work papers and computations will be made available to the  Department for verification.     2.  The Department agrees to accept upon verification, for assessment purposes, the  taxpayer’s determination of unreported transactions, receipts and/or tax.  If the Taxpayer  complies with the audit plan and all other provisions of the MAA, the Department will (a)  waive all penalties, and (b) waive half of the interest computed due, with the waiver of  interest limited to a maximum amount of $20,000.     3.  The Department has provided written procedural guidelines to be included as part of this  audit which specify the portion(s) of the audit that the Taxpayer is to conduct.  This guidance  includes the general scope of the audit, specific records expected to be reviewed, specific test  periods or methodologies to be used, layout of appropriate schedules and other technical  information necessary to complete the review as detailed in the audit plan.  The Department  will be available for ongoing consultation during the audit as issues or concerns develop.      4.  The Department will arrange a closing conference with the Taxpayer to provide the results  of the audit.  At that time the Taxpayer will receive the final tax determination reports,  including copies of all work papers compiled during the audit and tax returns for review,  signature and payment.    5.  It is agreed that in the event the Taxpayer fails to fulfill the terms of this agreement, the  Department will conduct the audit.  Any change in liability will be based on all available  information and may include any completed audit work of the Taxpayer and/or the  Department.

In mid to late March, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will begin  work to install a junction structure at the intersection of Central Avenue and 62nd Street.     During construction (about 6 weeks), the southbound lane of Central Avenue will be closed  (the northbound lane will remain open).  Traffic will be directed by a flagger. You will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Safety is always our first consideration.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    23rd Ward Office: 773-582-4444    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner
