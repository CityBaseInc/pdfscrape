SOUTH SHORE DRIVE    BUILT:  ARCHITECT:    MEYER FRIDSTEIN    The Shoreland Hotel, completed in 1926 on the lakefront in Chicago’s Hyde Park    neighborhood, stands as one of the city’s largest and most prominent early-twentieth-century  apartment hotels.  Residential or “apartment” hotels like the Shoreland, which combined   elements of apartment and hotel living and could be tailored to accommodate working-,   middle-, and upper-class residents, emerged as a new urban residential building type in the late- nineteenth century and proliferated during the 1910s and 1920s in the city’s lakefront   neighborhoods. The Shoreland Hotel is a reflection of the rapid growth and expansion of the  city during the 1920s, when skyrocketing land values, advancing building technologies, and  shifting tastes regarding apartment living made apartment hotels a popular housing choice.  The thirteen-story, U-shaped Shoreland Hotel was designed by Meyer Fridstein with Spanish  Renaissance Revival style terra-cotta detailing.  The Shoreland’s sheer size, its composition,  and the quality of its overall design, which featured face brick and terra-cotta ornamentation on  all four elevations, served to distinguish the building from other luxury high-rise apartment ho- tels that rose along the lakefront in communities north and south of the city’s central business  district.  The Shoreland Hotel was a major center of Hyde Park social life during the first half of the  twentieth century.  During the fifty years that it served as a luxury apartment hotel, the   Shoreland hosted such famous (and infamous) individuals as Amelia Earhart, Eleanor Roose- velt, Al Capone, Jimmy Hoffa, and Elvis Presley.  The originally lavish public spaces on the  first and second floors—including a double-height lobby with mezzanine, opulent public and  private dining rooms, and a large ballroom—also served as meeting and event spaces for Hyde   1      Park social circles.  Situated at the entrance to the Hyde Park neighborhood just north of Jackson Park and facing  the lakefront across Promontory Point, the Shoreland Hotel is a distinctive visual presence on  the lakefront.  The Building was completed just as the last stages of the city’s massive South  Park Development plans were being implemented, and the owners and operators of the   Shoreland viewed their hotel as an integral part of the improvements along Hyde Park’s shore- line.         BUILDING DESCRIPTION AND DEVELOPMENT HISTORY  The Shoreland Hotel is a thirteen-story steel-frame structure, roughly 187 feet by 300 feet, with  a masonry exterior and a flat roof with crenellated center mechanical penthouse.  The building  has a U-shaped configuration formed by a main block with angled north and south projecting  wings that flare to form a landscaped forecourt with a prominent circular drive and ornamental  cast-iron porte-cochere.  The entire building is faced with buff-colored Kittanning brick and  architectural glazed terra cotta produced by the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company.    The Shoreland faces east onto South Shore Drive, and is flanked on the north by a circa-1920s  L-shaped apartment building and on the south by the Jackson Shore Apartments, a luxury   apartment building that was designed by Rapp & Rapp and built by G. H. Gottschlack &   Company in 1917.  Promontory Point (completed in the late 1930s) is directly east of the   building across Lake Shore Drive.  Located approximately three blocks directly south, the Mu- seum of Science and Industry marks the northern end of Jackson Park.   Like most tall buildings in Chicago dating from the early-twentieth century, the Shoreland’s  facades are divided into three distinct parts—a substantial two-story terra-cotta base, a   minimally detailed, regularly fenestrated mid-section, and an elaborately decorated two-story  top.  The building is designed in an exuberant Spanish Renaissance Revival style, with an ar- caded base featuring double-height window openings with tri-foil cusped arches and terra-cotta  detailing, including heraldic shields, eagles, keystones with satyr heads, and other fanciful  touches.  At the center portion of the building, the two-story base projects outward to accommo- date an open terrace above, which is bordered by a terra-cotta balustrade decorated with the  Shoreland’s logo—a Spanish galleon ship at full mast—flanked by torchieres.  The ship motif  appears again along the top of the building, forming the center of two massive multi-colored  terra-cotta cartouches that decorate the two projecting towers.  Ornamentation at the top section  of the building includes terra-cotta arcades of cusped arches framing the eleventh-story win- dows, cornices topped with red terra-cotta roof tiles, and attic stories above the cornice-line that  feature baroque center sections. This upper-level terra-cotta detailing continues along all four  elevations.    On the interior, the building features a grand double-height lobby space measuring forty-seven  feet wide and 125 feet long.  Originally decorated in the Spanish Renaissance Revival  architectural style, the space was renovated in the 1930s in the much more streamlined Moderne  style, with all of the ornate detailing removed at that time.  North of the lobby is the classically- inspired Louis XVI Room, which served as the hotel’s main dining room.   The walls were  decorated with classical plaster detailing, including paired fluted Ionic pilasters supporting an   2      The Shoreland Hotel is a thirteen-story steel-frame masonry structure with a U-shaped   configuration formed by a main block with projecting end wings that form a landscaped forecourt.

Warren, who was best known for his hotel  designs. The ten-story Virginia Hotel (1888, demolished) was built for Leander McCormick at  Rush and Ohio Streets in an exclusive near-north-side residential district.  The ten-story   Lexington (1891, demolished) was built near Prairie Avenue to house the wealthiest class of  visitors to the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893.  These nineteenth-century luxury   apartment buildings were among the first in Chicago to combine “the status and services of a  hotel” with the premium location of the city’s best residential areas.  Because of the continued  resistance from among Chicago’s elite to the idea of apartment houses, however, these   buildings remained few and far between.  A nation-wide depression in1893 brought construction in Chicago to a standstill despite the  success of the World’s Columbian Exposition.  When full-scale building activity resumed  around the turn of the century, architects and builders had developed a set of norms for tall  apartment buildings that combined the classical architectural influence of the “White City” with  well-planned, efficient interiors.  These reforms, coupled with rapidly rising land values and the  increasing costs of keeping servants to care for a sprawling private home and grounds, finally  brought widespread acceptance to apartment living.  At this time, the residential or “apartment”  hotel emerged as a clearly defined and distinctive building type, a calculated combination of  apartment and hotel that offered the amenities, services, and public spaces of the best of   Chicago’s hotels to permanent residents who desired all of the comforts of home without the  responsibility.  A 1920s marketing brochure entitled “Apartment Hotels” succinctly outlined the  benefits of the new arrangement:   In an apartment hotel a family can live as comfortably in a five- or six-room  apartment as they can in a very large private residence…The mistress of the  home…has her problems simplified. She is not bothered with servants, coal bills,  janitors, repairs and a thousand and one other vexing problems, with which the  housewife is familiar, and…a community residence is less expensive than an in- dividual residence.   The post-depression building boom, which continued with little interruption until the Great   Depression hit in 1930, produced many of the best luxury apartment hotels in Chicago.    Architects and builders responded to changes in lifestyle that de-emphasized family-oriented  living and constructed buildings that were specifically designed to cater to distinctive social  groups.  Apartment hotels that offered smaller private rooms but which were close to the  beaches and offered dining, dancing, and proximity to nightlife and public transportation were  specifically targeted to young professionals.  Other apartment hotels were designed for a more  prosperous and established clientele, with large, well-appointed private suites, exceptional   service, and refined dining and entertainment spaces.  In either case, as architectural historian  Paul Groth points out in Living Downtown: The History of Residential Hotels in the United  States, the apartment hotel allowed its residents to have their privacy when they wanted it, but it  also offered the type of “gregarious existence not possible in private houses” because “grand  hotels were built for crowds and hotel life was spectacularly and notoriously public.”  The most imposing apartment hotels constructed between 1910 and 1930 were concentrated  along the affluent lakefront neighborhoods north and south of the city’s central business   districts.  On the north side, the fashionable communities of the Near North Side, Lincoln Park,   13

This is part of our approach  to renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with  you our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed  about the project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,283 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Avenue O, from  E. 106th Street to E. 108th Street. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Pope’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood  through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the  project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct  ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program  and our Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was  installed beneath your street.  Among other things:                 CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were   born.          AVENUE O WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,283 feet of 8- inch water main in S. Avenue O, from E. 106th Street to E. 108th Street.      Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further,  the old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late July 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Avenue O outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in  place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours.  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we  can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                          ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   ALDERMAN JOHN POPE   773-721-1999   312-742-1021            FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If  you have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also  call Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the  voicemail message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside  of our working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the  workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the  services from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour  notice when this is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old  pipe will break.  They can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If  we do this, we will let you know what is happening, even though we may be unable to  give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be  good neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By  working together, we can complete this important project as friends working for the  improvement of our community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your  neighbors to reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective  response as the only strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood  basis to work with us on practical steps (public and private) to protect your  property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters  to monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for  only the water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while  protecting one of our most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This  means that with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their  water bills.      Homeowner Incentives         Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:   A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the   meter had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit  www.metersave.org, call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account  number ready.  Space is limited based on funding availability and the number of  volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter  complete with the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of  charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to  Water Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1   place inside the home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount  of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this  limited time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise,  Water Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the  sustainability of our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500  gallons per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household  water consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water  consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This  saves 25 gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers  typically use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in  the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use  by 20-50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use  thousands of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save  money and water by preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45  million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could  face severe water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the  Chicago Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water  from Lake Michigan.               Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!

I want to be certain you are well  informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you have any  questions or concerns.     Our private contractor will install a new tumbling basin at W. 61st Street and St.  Louis. Following, our crews will install a new sewer main in W. 61st Street, from  S. St. Louis Avenue to S. Central Park Avenue. Finally, our contractor will install  a new sewer in S. Central Park Avenue, from W. 61st Street to W. 61st Place. The  old pipe dates back to around 1900 and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Foulkes’ office, and she has made clear we  are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project.

Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Toni Foulkes        15th Ward                                                     Do you wonder what was happening in 1900?  That’s about the time the old sewer main was  installed beneath your street.

Frank Baum wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.    The first electric bus became operational in New York City.    English handwriting experts established the art of calligraphy.         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  After our private contractor installs a new tumbling basin at 61st Street/St. Louis, the  Department of Water Management will be installing a new sewer main in W. 61st Street, from  S. St. Louis Avenue to S. Central Park Avenue. Then, the contractor will install a new sewer  main in S. Central Park Avenue, from W. 61st Street to W. 61st Place.       Reason:  The old pipe dates back to around 1900 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded  by W. 60th Street on the north, W. 63rd Street on the south, S. St. Louis Avenue on the east, and  S. Hamlin Avenue on the west benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work by the contractor at 61st Street/St. Louis will commence in mid-January, with  completion anticipated for mid-February. Installation of the new sewer in 61st Street will start in  mid-February, and end in mid-March. Installation of the new sewer in Central Park will begin  in late March, with completion anticipated for mid April. Restoration of the damaged  streets/parkways will follow (mid April to mid May). Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working  hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1            ALDERMAN TONI FOULKES   773-863-0220            ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it  is.  Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of  digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will  pave the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and  curb at least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City  of Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce  the risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are  aware that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Foulkes,  and others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.

The park’s exceptional foot traffic, Michigan Avenue location and state-of-the-art  sound system will bring a fresh way to enjoy a classic event.      As one of Chicago’s top destinations, Millennium Park is undeniably one of the most sought-after  venues for brands to reach a cross-section of consumers, from Chicagoans representing the city’s 77  neighborhoods, suburban families and a significant presence of international visitors.  Growing  interest has resulted in more onsite promotional opportunities throughout the year.     Last year’s inaugural Millennium Park Film & Music Series was a resounding success but partners  requested separate series to attract targeted audiences. We heard you!  Now brands can choose  between the Millennium Park Film Series or Millennium Park Music Series to better align their  brand/activation.   The Series Sponsorship package at Lake FX Creative-Con offers an opportunity for genuine brand  integration.  In addition to standard promotional benefits, partners can develop their own panel  discussion or workshop that targets Chicago’s arts & creative community.     A dance competition like no other, SummerDance-off will host four competitions in the park – two  footwork competitions and two steppin’ competitions.     These battles will each lead to one winner who will go on to a winner-take-all show at Millennium  Park on August 26th.    The Chicago City Markets packages the City’s markets under one umbrella. By combining the  resources of the popular Chicago Farmers Markets, Community Markets and Maxwell Street Market,  we can extend brand exposure across several locations throughout the year.
