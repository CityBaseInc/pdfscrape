I want to be certain you are well  informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you have any  questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing a new sewer main in W. Ohio Street, from N.  Central Avenue to N. Parkside Avenue, and in N. Parkside Avenue, from W.  Huron Street to 330’ south of W. Ohio Street. The old pipe dates back to 1902 and  needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Graham’s office, and she has made clear we  are to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Deborah Graham        29th Ward                                                   Do you wonder what was happening in 1902? That’s the year the old  sewer main was installed beneath your street. Among other things:                Richard J. Daley             Animal Crackers were introduced to the American public.    Theodore Roosevelt became the first American President to ride in an automobile.    The first college football bowl game, the Rose Bowl between Michigan and Stanford,   was held in Pasadena, California.     JC Penney opened its first store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming.    The Texas Oil Company, Texaco, was formed.    Denmark became the first country to adopt fingerprinting as a way to identify criminals.    Richard J. Daley was born; he served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in   1976.      OHIO/PARKSIDE SEWER        PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will be installing a new sewer main in W.  Ohio Street, from N. Central Avenue to N. Parkside Avenue, and in N. Parkside Avenue, from  W. Huron Street to 330’ south of W. Ohio Street.      Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1902 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by Huron Street on the north, Race Avenue on the south, Central Avenue on the east and the alley west of  Parkside Avenue on the west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work will begin shortly, with completion anticipated for September. Restoration of  the damaged streets/parkways will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other  factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: Our excavation and the equipment involved all take up space, and safety, of course, is  the foremost consideration.  We may have some closures to “through traffic”. You will always  have access to your property.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1            ALDERMAN DEBORAH GRAHAM   773-261-4646            ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         OHIO/PARKSIDE SEWER PROJECT   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it  is.  Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of  digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will  pave the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and  curb at least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City  of Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce  the risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are  aware that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Graham,  and others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.

While IPRA registers all complaints, not all complaints      are investigated by IPRA.  The department    investigates those allegations of misconduct that      concern the use of excessive force, domestic    violence, coercion through a threat of violence, and      biased-based verbal abuse.  IPRA also investigates  all cases in which a CPD member discharges his or      her firearm or Taser stun gun in a manner that    potentially could strike an individual, as well as all        deaths of persons or extraordinary occurrences in    police custody even if no allegations of misconduct is      made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         All other complaints are forwarded to CPD for      investigation.  Cases involving allegations of drug      use, thefts and procedural violations, for example, are    investigated by the Internal Affairs Division of CPD.      Critical Programs/Services to Assist  Residents         Community Meetings    The Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA)      conducts quarterly meetings in various parts of the    City to provide an opportunity to interact with    members of the community and inform residents    of IPRA’s role and function in the police oversight    process. At these meetings IPRA explains its      investigative process, answers questions from      participants, and responds to concerns from members    of the public.       Stakeholders Panel    The Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA)    conducts semi-annual meetings held at IPRA      Headquarters that provide an opportunity for the    community and police organizations, who can affect    or be affected by the police oversight process, to     present issues of concern directly to IPRA personnel.    These “town-hall” style panels provide an opportunity    for a candid dialogue designed to educate IPRA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    117117116                                                                                                                                                                                    investigators about community and police issues and    to inform community and police leaders about IPRA’s    policies and procedures and addresses any questions    and concerns.      Public Reporting    IPRA provides transparency to the disciplinary    process by making public reports on that process and    continuing to use its website as a repository for    information. The website contains Quarterly Reports,    Annual Reports, and a monthly abstract of all      investigations for which IPRA has recommended a       sustained finding against accused CPD members.    The website also provides statistical and    demographic data for every officer-involved shooting    since 2008. IPRA’s website allows citizens to directly    initiate a complaint with IPRA against a CPD member    or to compliment the actions of a CPD member.
