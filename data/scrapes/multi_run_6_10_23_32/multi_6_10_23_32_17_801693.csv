This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,744 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Locust Street, from N.  Franklin Street to N. La Salle Drive, and N. Franklin Street, from W. Oak Street to W. Chicago  Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1885, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Burnett’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,744 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Locust Street, from N. Franklin Street to N. La Salle Drive, and N. Franklin  Street, from W. Oak Street to W. Chicago Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of a 6-inch pipe, and we what to expand capacity. Furthermore,  the old pipe dates back to 1885 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by mid October 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.     Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Locust Street and N. Franklin Street outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                                                   ALDERMAN WALTER BURNETT JR.   3-1-1   773- 432-1995   312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main installation is slated to conclude in  mid October 2012. Restoration (to be completed by the Chicago Department of Transportation)  will follow. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other  factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

SECURE all openings to prevent unlawful entry.     Openings with secure doors and windows, without broken or cracked glass, may   be left as-is so long as they remain secure and in good condition.     Openings may be boarded with plywood or secured by other reasonable means.    At least one exit must be maintained (more for larger buildings).   If a property has repeated break-ins, additional measures may be required.      2.  REGISTER the vacant building on the Department of Buildings web site. (see below)     A registration fee ($500) is required at the time of initial registration.    The registration must be renewed every 6 months for as long as the building  remains vacant, and material changes in the registration information must be  reported through the website within 20 days.  There is no fee for renewal.  3.    POST signs on the building, visible and legible from the nearest street and alley.     The signs must include the name, address, and phone number of the registered  mortgagee (or mortgagee’s agent) and the vacant building registration number.  4.  MAINTAIN the property and inspect regularly to verify the exterior is clean and secure.     Keep the lot clean. Maintain fences and gates. Cut the grass, remove weeds,   garbage, debris, dead trees and fallen limbs. In winter, shovel any accumulated  snow to allow public use of the adjacent sidewalk and keep the property free  from pests such as rats and other rodents.     Winterize the building’s heating and plumbing systems.    Maintain the exterior of the building (walls, windows, doors and roof) and stairs   and steps leading to the main entrance.   These requirements are subject to certain limitations and defenses.  Consult the Municipal Code  of Chicago for complete details.  Failure to comply with these requirements may result in serious  penalties.  Registration of a vacant building will not prevent the City of Chicago from seeking  authority to demolish or secure a vacant building as authorized by law  A property must be deregistered if the loan is transferred or released or if the building is  reoccupied, sold, or demolished. A new owner registration must be created by any person  who takes title to a vacant building following a judicial sale or other foreclosure-related transfer,  including REO, within 30 days of taking ownership.

General Information:  The Tax is imposed on the privilege of transferring title to, or beneficial interest in, real property located in the City of Chicago.  See section 3-33-030 of the Code.  The tax rate is $3.75 per $500.00 of the transfer price, or fraction thereof, of the real property, or beneficial interest in the property.  Id.  Governmental or Charitable Organization Exemption - Subsection 3-33-060(B) of the Code; Section 3, Paragraph B of the Form:  Transfers involving real property (1) acquired by or from a governmental body; (2) acquired by any corporation, society, association, foundation or institution organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious or educational purposes; or (3) acquired by any international organization not subject to local taxes under applicable law are exempt.  The Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddy Mac”) do not qualify as governmental bodies.  Transfers for less than $500 - Subsection 3-33-060(E) of the Municipal Code; Section 3, Paragraph E of the Form:  Transfers in which the transfer  price is less than $500 are exempt.  The “transfer price” means the consideration furnished for the transfer of title to, or beneficial interest in, real property, valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits and property, determined without any deduction for mortgages, liens or encumbrances, and specifically including the amount of any indebtedness or obligation canceled or discharged in connection with the transfer.  See subsection 3-33- 020(H).   Typical types of transfers that fall into this category are (1) transfers between a trust and its beneficiaries and (2) transfers of gifts.  With respect to transfers between trusts and their beneficiaries, only the following types of transfers are exempt from the tax:  (a) transfers from the sole beneficiaries to the trust, where the trust agreement provides that the beneficial ownership of the beneficiaries is the same as it was before the transfer into trust, and (b) transfers from the trust to the sole beneficiaries of the trust, where the distribution agreement provides that the ownership of the beneficiaries is the  same as it was before the transfer out of the trust.  With respect to transfers which result from divorce or separation proceedings, it is presumed that the consideration given for the transfer of real property between spouses is equal to the fair market value of the interest conveyed, and is subject to the Tax.  For example, if one spouse is ordered or agrees to transfer to the other spouse his or her interest in real property, which is owned jointly with the other spouse, the spouse who receives the transferring spouse’s interest is subject to taxation; and the amount of the transfer price will be presumed to be one-half of the fair market value of the real property .  See Chicago Department of Revenue Real Property Transfer Tax Ruling #3, October 3, 2005.   Transfers of property in exchange for an interest in a corporation, limited liability corporation, or other legal entity are taxable events, unless the transferor is the sole owner of the legal entity to which the property is being transferred.  The transfer price is the fair market value of the real property.  For example, if an individual or legal entity transferred its real property to a partnership and received only a one-half interest in the partnership, a Transfer Tax would be due on one-half of the fair market value of the real property.

Transfers where the property is intended to be converted into residential use and such use consumes 50% or more of the property do not qualify for the exemption.  See Chicago Department of Revenue Real Property Transfer Tax Ruling #2, May 13, 2004.    Transfers to Secured Creditors - Subsection 3-33-060(M) of the Code; Section 3, Paragraph M of the Form:  Transfers in which the deed or other instrument of transfer is issued to the mortgagee or secured creditor pursuant to a mortgage or security interest foreclosure proceeding or sale or pursuant to a transfer in lieu of foreclosure are exempt.  When a creditor holds a secured interest in property (e.g., a bank or savings and loan through a mortgage) and acquires the property either (a) at a foreclosure sale for an amount, which is equal to or less than the outstanding debt that is secured by the property, or (b) through a deed from the debtor in lieu of the foreclosure action, the transfer is exempt from the Tax.  A second mortgagee that acquires property through a foreclosure and assumes the debt of the primary secured lender is taxable on the amount of the outstanding debt owed to the primary lender.  For example, if a primary lender has an outstanding debt of $200,000 secured with real property, and a second lender has an outstanding debt of $100,000 secured with the same property; and if the second lender took a deed for the property from the debtor, in lieu of foreclosing on the property, then the second lender would incur a tax on the amount of the outstanding debt, which  it assumed (i.e., $200,000).  Other information:  Where the transfer price reported on the Form is different than the purchase price of the property, the difference must be fully explained, with full documentation attached to the Form.  The Transfer Tax is due upon the earlier of the delivery or recording of the deed, assignment or other instrument of transfer (see section 3- 33-030) and is payable through the purchase of stamps (see section 3- 33-040).  Title companies are responsible for making sure that stamps are purchased, cancelled, and affixed to the deed or other instrument of transfer, when they receive the proceeds for the stamps at the closing.  See section 3-33-040.  Failure to purchase and affix the stamps will subject them to interest and penalties that accrue on the unpaid tax.  A program is being offered by the City during the period beginning October 24, 2005, and ending December 16, 2005, to provide amnesty from interest and penalties on Transfer Tax liabilities incurred prior to July 1, 2005.  Amnesty is not available with respect to any tax identified in any written notice of tax audit or tax investigation that the Department has sent to a taxpayer or other debtor.
