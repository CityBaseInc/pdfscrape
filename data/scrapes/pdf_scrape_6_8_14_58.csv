Austin  Chairman, Committee on the Budget and Government Operations           To:           October 31, 2012   121   Request for Information from Annual Appropriation Committee Hearing   Sandra Alfred  Executive Director  Commission on Animal Care and Control   Maria Guerra  Mayor’s Office of Legislative Counsel and Government Affairs     From:             CC:      Date:      Re:    Ref ID:      The attached information is in response to questions posed at our department’s hearing on  October 24, 2012 to discuss the 2013 budget.      Alderman John Arena, of the 45th Ward requested information relating to dog bite investigations  by Animal Care and Control (ACC).     ACC investigates dog bites reported to the Chicago Police Department. The preliminary bite  investigation involves interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence to determine whether  violations of the Municipal Code of Chicago have occurred.  Every animal that bites must be  taken to a licensed veterinarian to be observed for signs of rabies for 10 days.     Where an animal has caused serious injury or shown a pattern of aggressive behavior, ACC  performs a dangerous dog investigation to determine if the attacking animal is safe to remain in  Chicago.  If circumstances warrant, ACC can impound the animal during the investigation.  If  the dog is determined to be dangerous, ACC may impose ownership restrictions to reduce the  possibility of future incidents.    Chapter 7-12 of the Municipal Code of Chicago outlines both the penalty for failing to restrain  one’s animal and the process of determining whether an animal is dangerous.    As always, please let me know if you have any further questions.
