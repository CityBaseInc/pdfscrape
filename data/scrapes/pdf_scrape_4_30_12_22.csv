RECITALS   WHEREAS, the Taxpayer, upon learning of its mistake or oversight, is   voluntarily notifying the Chicago Department of Finance (the “Department”) of its   liability under the _ tax, chapter _ of the Municipal Code of Chicago; and   WHEREAS, the Taxpayer warrants that it is not the subject of any audit or other   investigation by the Department; and   WHEREAS, the Taxpayer warrants that its liability for the _ tax being disclosed   in this Agreement is not the subject of any audit or other investigation by the Department   including any audit or other investigation by the Department involving a person or entity   which was involved with the Taxpayer in a bulk sale of assets (as defined in section 3-4-  140 of the Municipal Code of Chicago); and   WHEREAS, the City and the Department are administratively convenience by   the Taxpayer's voluntary disclosure of its liability for the _ tax; and   WHEREAS, the City stands to derive substantial revenue that otherwise might   not have been collected without the Taxpayer's voluntary disclosure; and   [WHEREAS, on __, the Taxpayer tendered a payment of ___ in anticipation of   Page 1 of 4      settling its liability for the __ tax.]   NOW, THEREFORE, the City and the Taxpayer hereby agree as follows:   1.  The foregoing recitals are hereby incorporated herein and made an express part   of this Agreement.   2.  The Taxpayer has determined that the amount of its tax liability for the _ tax   for the periods _ through _ inclusively (the ""_ tax Self-assessment Periods”), is $ _ (its   ""Tax Liability"").   3.  The Department agrees not to assess Taxpayer for any possible _ tax which   may have accrued prior to the _ tax Self-assessment Periods; provided, however, that no   term of this Agreement is breached and that no material misrepresentation was made to   the Department by Taxpayer with respect to its Tax Liability to induce the Department to   enter into this Agreement.   4.  The Taxpayer has paid or shall pay to the City for the _ tax Self-assessment   Periods the amount of its Tax Liability, plus interest thereon accrued at the rate of 12%   simple interest computed daily.  Such interest (its ""Interest Liability"") totals $ _ for the _   tax, as of __.    5.  Except as otherwise provided herein, all penalties otherwise attributable to the   Taxpayer's Tax Liability shall be waived by the City.   [6.  As the Taxpayer has made payments that equal its Tax Liability and its   Interest Liability, no further payments are required from the Taxpayer.]     7.  The Taxpayer's determination of its Tax Liability, including the methodology   used by the Taxpayer, and its Interest Liability have been documented in a form that has   been reviewed by the Department.  All submissions to the Department by the Taxpayer in   Page 2 of 4      accordance with this paragraph 7 shall be deemed by the parties to form a part of this   Agreement.   8.  No provision of this Agreement shall preclude the Department from   conducting an audit or other investigation of the Taxpayer, within the appropriate   statutory period, with respect to the Taxpayer's Tax Liability.   9.  If the Taxpayer violates any of the provisions of this Agreement, or if pursuant   to an audit or other investigation, the Taxpayer's actual __ tax liability for the _ tax Self-  assessment Periods exceeds the amount determined under paragraph 2 by ten percent   (10%) or more, then neither paragraph 3 nor paragraph 5 shall apply to Taxpayer, and   Taxpayer shall be liable to the City in the amount of Taxpayer's actual __ tax liability   plus interest and penalties thereon.  If the Taxpayer's actual tax liability exceeds the   amount determined under Paragraph 2 by less than ten percent (10%), then Taxpayer   shall be liable to the City in the amount of such difference, plus interest and penalties   thereon.   10.  Taxpayer hereby waives its right to an administrative hearing before the   Department, its right to claim a credit or refund from the Department, and its right to file   or join any lawsuit, with respect to payment of the amounts determined under paragraphs   2 and 4.   11.  Either prior to or concurrent with the signing of this Agreement, Taxpayer   shall submit a completed Tax Registration Form which  registers the Taxpayer with the   Department to collect and/or pay all applicable Chicago taxes for which it is liable.   12.  This Agreement shall be effective upon execution by the parties and,   thereafter, shall be binding upon the City, the Taxpayer and the Taxpayer's successors   Page 3 of 4      and assigns.   13.  The persons signing this Agreement certify and warrant that they have the   power to enter into and execute this Agreement.   14.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts each of which   shall be considered an original.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement effective   as of the day and year first above written.

Under section 3-4-153 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, the City Comptroller (the “Comptroller”), with the approval of the Department of Law, has the authority to abate any tax liabilities that have been assessed when the Comptroller determines that there is an uncertainty as to the collectability of the assessment within a reasonable period of time.  The Comptroller’s decision will be made after a review of the recommendations presented by the Financial Hardship Committee (the “Committee”).  It is expected that the Committee will make its recommendation to the Comptroller within 45 days of its receipt of a completed Application, and that the Comptroller’s decision will be made within 30 days of the Comptroller’s receipt of the Committee’s recommendation.  2)  3)  4)  5)  6)  7)  8)  Power of Attorney - If this Application is completed by someone other than a) an owner or officer of the business that has been assessed a tax liability or b) an individual who has been assessed a tax liability, a completed  Power of Attorney form must be on file with the Department or submitted with this Application.  Completed Application - This Application is complete when all schedules and line items have been completed or answered, and all supporting documents are attached or included.  The applicant will be contacted for any missing required information.  If no response is received from the applicant or the required information is not received within 45 days of the letter requesting this information, the Application will be rejected as being incomplete, and the Department will continue its efforts to collect the total amount of the tax liability.  Post Assessment Periods - The business must provide all City of Chicago tax returns for the periods subsequent to the close of the period for which the assessment or assessments has been made.  If these returns have previously been filed, amended returns must be filed which conform to the methodology that the Department used in computing the tax liability on the notice of assessment.  Federal Income Tax Returns - Applicant must provide copies of applicant’s federal and state income tax returns that were signed by applicant, including all schedules, that encompass the periods of the assessment, as well as any recent returns that include periods subsequent to the assessment periods.  Other Supporting Documents - All documents that support the applicant’s claim of an inability to pay a tax liability owed to the City of Chicago because of financial hardship should be included.  In addition to the documents requested in the Application, supporting documents which must also be submitted are a) bank statements for the last six months, b) debts secured by liens or mortgages, and c) for individuals, paycheck vouchers for the last two months.  Responsible Owner/Officer/Partner/Employee's Personal Credit Information - Any owner of a sole proprietorship, or any officer, employee, partner or other individual who controls, supervises, or is responsible for the filing of Chicago tax returns or the payment of Chicago taxes must complete an application for himself or herself and provide and include personal federal and state income tax returns for the same periods as the business.  Related Entity - For purposes of this application, a related entity is any company, partnership, or other legal entity, including but not limited to individuals, that owns the applicant, is owned by the applicant, or is owned by the owner of the applicant.

Qualified applicants are entitled to a refund in the  amount of the CTA Portion.  In no event will this refund extend to any amount paid for the City of  Chicago Portion of the RPTT paid.  Please review the transfer records to verify that the refund  applicant paid the CTA Portion, as only the person who bears the burden of the tax (i.e., pays the  tax) is eligible for the refund.      REFUND PROCESSING PROCEDURES    Additional supporting documentation to substantiate a claim for refund may be requested. The  request for refund must be filed using the Department of Finance CTA Portion of the Real  Property Tax Refund Application. Refunds will not be approved if the applicant owes other tax or  non-tax debt (e.g., warrants, parking tickets, or water bills) to the City of Chicago.     After the Department receives a refund application, the applicant will be sent a Notification of  Receipt of Refund Request acknowledging receipt of his or her refund application. The refund  process begins when the Department of Finance issues the applicant the above mentioned  Notification of Receipt of Refund Request.  The entire refund process can take up to six (6)  months to complete.    After the refund request is approved or denied, the applicant will be issued a Notice of Tentative  Determination of Claim (the “Determination”).    If the claim is approved, the applicant will be issued a refund.  Approved refund claims may  receive interest at the statutory rate beginning on the date the tax was paid in error and running  through the date the Department of Finance approves the claim in writing.    If the refund claim is denied, the applicant may file a written protest within 35 days of the date of  receipt of the Determination. If the applicant files a timely protest, a formal administrative hearing  will be scheduled. If the applicant does not file a written protest within 35 days, the Determination  will become final and the applicant will lose his or her right to object to the Determination in court.

Background   In  general,  Section  4-156-020(A)  of  the  Chicago  Municipal  Code  (“Code”)  imposes  a  tax  on  amusements at a rate of eight percent:  ""Except as otherwise provided by this article, an amusement  tax is imposed upon the patrons of every amusement within the city. The rate of the tax shall be  equal to eight percent of the admission fees or other charges paid for the privilege to enter, to  witness, to view or to participate in such amusement, unless subsection E of this section provides  for a lower rate.""   Section 4-156-020(D)(1) provides an exemption for live cultural performances at venues with a  maximum seating capacity of 750 or under:  ""The tax imposed in subsection A of this section shall  not apply to or be imposed upon the admission fees to witness in person live theatrical, live musical  or other live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in the city  whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is not more than 750 persons.""   Section  4-156-020(E)  provides  a  reduced  rate  for  live  cultural  performances  at  venues  with  a  maximum seating capacity of more than 750:  ""The rate of the tax imposed in subsection A of this  section  shall  be  four  percent  of  the  admission  fees  or  other  charges  to  witness  in  person  live  theatrical, live musical or other live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater  or other space in the city whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is  more than 750 persons.""   Section 4-156-010 provides a definition of live cultural performance:  ""'Live theatrical, live musical  or other live cultural performance' means a live performance in any of the disciplines which are  commonly regarded as part of the fine arts, such as live theater, music, opera, drama, comedy, ballet,  modern  or  traditional  dance,  and  book  or  poetry  readings.  The  term  does  not  include  such  amusements as athletic events, races or performances conducted at adult entertainment cabarets (as  defined in Chapter 16-16 of this Code).""   The purpose of this ruling is to specify the situations in which the Chicago Department of Revenue  (“Department”) will consider the activities of a disc jockey (""DJ"") to qualify as a ""live cultural  performance"" at a dance club or other venue, so as to qualify for the exemption or reduced rate set  forth in Sections 4-156-020(D)(1) and (E).   Section 2.  Requirements   In order for the activities of a DJ to be considered a ""live cultural performance"" at a dance club or  other venue, the activities must substantially add to or otherwise modify the pre-recorded material  used by the DJ, in the form of a significant degree of technical manipulation, singing, speaking,  dancing or other activity.   Section 3.  Safe Harbor   The Department will assume that the activities of the DJ qualify as a live cultural performance where  both of the following conditions exist:      a.   b.   The pre-recorded material used by the DJ was recorded by the DJ.  This may be original  work composed by the DJ or the work of other artists that the DJ has mixed or otherwise  modified.   The DJ is paid substantially above the rate that would be paid solely for the service of  playing the pre-recorded material of other artists.  As of the date of the issuance of this  ruling,  the  Department  will  assume  that  the  payment  of  $2,000  or  more  for  a  single  performance qualifies the event for this safe harbor.   Section 4.  Additional Factors   Where the activities of a DJ do not qualify for the safe harbor set forth in Section 3, they may  nevertheless qualify as a live cultural performance if at least four of the five following factors apply:   a.	   b.	   c.	   d.	   The DJ is featured in advertisements for the venue.   The DJ is visible to patrons of the venue, who spend a substantial amount of time observing  the DJ’s performance.   The DJ is featured more prominently than other amusements or activities available at the  venue.   The patrons are charged substantially above the amount that would be paid for entry into the  venue in the absence of the DJ.  For purposes of this ruling, the term “substantially above”  means at least one and a half times the amount that would be charged without the DJ.   e.	   The DJ is represented by a manager and/or agent.   Section 5.  Proof   The venue has the burden of proving that it qualifies for the exemption or reduced rate set forth in  Sections 4-156-020(D)(1) and (E).  The proof required includes, at a minimum, a signed and sworn  statement concerning the requirements listed in Section 2 above, along with any of the factors that   apply from Sections 3 and 4, on a form to be provided by the Department.  In addition, the venue  must attach to the statement a copy of the contract between the venue and the DJ.   Upon request, the venue may also be required to provide the Department with books and records  showing the name of each DJ who performed at the venue, the dates and times at which each DJ  performed, and the admission fees or other charges paid by patrons to witness the DJ at each of the  dates and times at which each DJ performed, along with such other documents and information as  the Department may reasonably require.

Under  the  Chicago  Uniform  Revenue  Procedures  Ordinance    (URPO) (Chapter 3-4 of the Chicago Municipal Code) and other Chicago tax ordinances,  taxpayers and tax collectors are subject to penalties for failing to file returns, filing late  returns, and making late payments. These penalties may be waived or abated if the return  or  payment  was  late,  or  was  not  filed  or  made,  due  to  circumstances  beyond  the  taxpayer’s  or  the  tax  collector’s  control.  In  such  cases,  “reasonable  cause”    exists  to  excuse the payment of all or part of a penalty.    Taxpayers and tax collectors bear the burden of establishing “reasonable cause.”    Each request to waive or abate the payment of a penalty must be made in writing to the  Chicago  Department  of  Revenue  and  accompanied  by  (1)  a  written  explanation  of  the  reasons why reasonable cause exists and (2) supporting documentation. Each request will  be evaluated on its own merits.    SECTION  2.    A  tax  return  or  tax  payment  is  timely  when  it  is:  (1)  physically    received by the Chicago Department of Revenue on or before the due date; (2) received  by  the  Chicago  Department  of  Revenue  in  an  envelope  or  wrapper  displaying  a  valid,  readable United States mail postmark dated on or before the due date, properly addressed  to  the  department,  with  adequate  postage  prepaid;  or  (3)  filed  electronically  via  the  Internet through the City of Chicago website on or before the due date.    SECTION  3.  The  examples  set  forth  below  represent  some  of  the  “reasonable    cause” claims most frequently made by taxpayers and tax collectors. These examples are  not intended to be comprehensive.    A.  payment and/or failure to file penalties:      The U.S. Postal Service mishandled the mail and, for this reason only, the  envelope or wrapper containing the tax return or the tax payment was postmarked after  the due date. In such cases, taxpayers and tax collectors must provide a letter written by  the station manager of the local U.S. Postal Service facility, which establishes those facts.    The taxpayer or tax collector provides documentation, which shows that    the business records of the taxpayer or the tax collector were destroyed by a fire or other  casualty and, for this reason only, the tax return or the tax payment was late or not filed.   In  the  following  examples,  “reasonable  cause”  exists  to  waive  or  abate  the  late   2.   1.   3.   4.   5.   The  taxpayer  or  tax  collector  reasonably  relied  on  erroneous  written       The  taxpayer  or  tax  collector  provides  documentation  which  shows  that  the tax return or the tax payment was late, or not filed or made, due to (a) an individual  taxpayer’s death or the death of a member of his/her immediate family or (b) the death of  a person having the sole authority, on behalf of a corporation or a partnership, to execute  or file the return or to pay the tax, or the death of a member of such person’s immediate  family.      information as described in URPO Ruling #3.      The  taxpayer  or  tax  collector  relied  on  erroneous  advice  from  an  accountant or an attorney and, for this reason only, the tax return or the tax payment was  late  or  not  filed.  In  such  cases,  the  taxpayer  or  tax  collector  must  provide  either  (a)  a  letter  signed  by  the  accountant  or  the  attorney  which  specifically  states  that  he  or  she  gave the advice relied on by the taxpayer or tax collector or (b) a document prepared by  the accountant or the attorney which contains the erroneous advice.    The taxpayer or tax collector was unable to file its tax return electronically    via the Internet solely because the City of Chicago website was out of service on the date  on which the return was due.  The taxpayer or tax collector must demonstrate that it had  its  return  information  filled  out  and  saved  prior  to  attempting  to  file  the  return  electronically.    The  taxpayer  or  tax  collector  also  must  file  its  return  at  the  first  reasonable opportunity thereafter.    B.  payment of late and/or failure to file penalties:      The  tax  return  or  the  tax  payment  was  late,  or  was  not  filed  or  made,  because  the  taxpayer  or  the  tax  collector  was  not  aware  of  the  obligation  to  file  the  returns or to pay the tax. All taxpayers and tax collectors are required to know about their  tax obligations and to comply with all Chicago tax ordinances.      The taxpayer or tax collector delegated its duty to file the tax return or to  make a tax payment to another person (e.g., an accountant or an attorney) whom, without  reasonable cause, filed the return or made the payment late. All taxpayers and tax  collectors are required to know about their tax obligations and to comply with all Chicago  tax ordinances. Consequently, they are liable for their delegates’ failure to comply with  Chicago tax ordinances.     In the following examples “reasonable cause” does not exist to waive or abate the   6.   1.   2.

This change might be difficult for my company.  If my contract is eligible   for Centralized Invoice Processing, can I just continue to do business with  the ordering department the way I always have?   •  No. CIP is not optional, and there are no approved alternative   processes.  While we recognize that change is not always easy, we  are also confident that the new CIP policy will provide benefits to  our vendors (like faster payments and easier payment inquiries)  and to the City (like better management reporting) that will outweigh  any short-term difficulties.  We appreciate the support of our  vendors as we implement these and future changes, and look  forward to serving you better.        TOPIC – ORDERS      2.  Is Centralized Invoice Processing for both goods and services?   •  Eligibility for centralized invoice processing is categorized by   Purchase Order type.  An eligible contract may include goods,  services or both.      3.  The department that is ordering my goods and/or services creates a PO-  Release after I submit my invoice because they don’t know the actual  quantity they will use at the time they place the order.  Is this OK?   •  No, it is not.  Departments have received instructions and training   on how to create estimated Releases for variable quantity  orders.  They should create these Releases IN ADVANCE, and  then create Receipts for actual quantities upon delivery.  You  should generate an invoice only after the City provides a Receipt  number, and your invoice should include BOTH the Release and  Receipt numbers in order to receive fastest-possible payment.       TOPIC – RECEIPTS    4.  Where do I get a Receipt number?   •  The Receipt number will be provided to you by the department that   ordered and to whom you delivered goods and/or services.           5.  How will the Receipt number be sent?   •   It is up to each department to determine how they will communicate  Receipt numbers to vendors.  Possible communication channels  include USPS mail, email or phone.  We suggest you speak with  the person who is ordering your goods or services to clarify how  their department will communicate Receipt numbers.   6.  When should I start getting Receipt numbers?   •  City departments were advised to start providing Receipt numbers  to their vendors beginning April 1, 2011.  Invoices submitted to CIP  after 4/18 should reference a Receipt number. If the Receipt  number is not included, invoice payment will be delayed.   7.  Is the receipt number the same as the stamped suborder number on the   Blanket Release?   It is not the same number.  The Receipt number is generated only  after you deliver goods or services, and will document the actual  quantities received by the ordering department.  This quantity might  differ from quantities ordered.         8.  What if the department doesn’t send me a Receipt number?   •  Departments have been directed to enter TIMELY and ACCURATE  Receipts in our accounting system to document the exact quantities  delivered by their vendors.  As part of our process improvement  initiative, we will be monitoring and reporting on performance  measurements related to Receipt entry, and addressing any  deficiencies with individual departments.  If you have not received a Receipt number within 5 business days  of delivery, send your invoice to the CIP unit with the notation ‘TBD  – Department’ in the RECEIPT NUMBER field.  While your  payment will be delayed, we will work with the department on your  behalf to get a Receipt number and to prevent further problems.   •   •            TOPIC – INVOICES    9.  My PO is not on the list of eligible contracts.  Where should I submit my   If your PO (contract) is not on the list, or if you are providing goods  or services without a contract, then your invoice is not eligible for  centralized invoice processing.  You should continue to submit your  invoice to the ordering department as you do today.   invoice?   •               10. Can I send my invoice by mail? What about email?   Invoices may be submitted to the CIP unit by mail or as email  attachments.  Instructions and addresses for submitting invoices to  CIP can be found at:   http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fin/provdrs/centralized_invoiceprocessing.html   •   If you are submitting your invoice to the department that ordered  and to whom you delivered goods and/or services, then you should  contact that department to ask how they want the invoice submitted.   11. If I submit my invoice by e-mail, should I also send an original hard copy?   Should I send a duplicate invoice to the ordering department?   •  No, you need not submit a hard-copy in addition to an email   submission, nor should you be submitting duplicate invoice copies  to ANY City department.   12. Should I continue to submit Subcontract Payment Certification forms with   my invoice?   •  DO NOT submit Subcontractor Certification forms to the CIP   unit.  CIP will not enter the information into the accounting  system.  You should contact the City department to which you are  providing goods and/or services to see whether they wish to  continue to receive these forms.   •   13. Should I change the ‘Sold To’ or ‘Bill To’ locations on my invoices?  ‘Sold To' should still be shown as the address of the ordering  department.  'Bill To' can be changed to ‘Invoices, Office of the City  Comptroller, 33 N. LaSalle St., Room 700, Chicago IL 60602’.   14.  Who should I contact to find out the status of my invoice?   •  You can contact either the department that ordered your goods   and/or services OR the Comptroller’s Office for information on the  status of your invoice.     •

Daley, Mayor,  and Members of the City Council  City of Chicago, Illinois   We have audited the accompanying basic financial statements of Chicago Midway International Airport  (“Midway”) of the City of Chicago, Illinois (“City”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and for the years  then ended, listed in the foregoing table of contents.  These financial statements are the responsibility of  the City’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on  our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes consideration  of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s  internal control over financial reporting for Midway. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit  also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial  statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as  well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a  reasonable basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Note 1, the basic financial statements referred to above present only Chicago Midway  International Airport and are not intended to present the financial position of the City, the results of its  operations, and its cash flows, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States of America.    In our opinion, such basic financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of Chicago Midway International Airport as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its  operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted in the United States of America.   As described in Note 1 to the basic financial statements, Midway adopted the provisions of Governmental  Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 40, Deposit and Investment Risk Disclosures, and  Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 42, Accounting and Financial Reporting for  Impairment of Capital Assets and for Insurance Recoveries, as of and for the year ended December 31,  2005.    The Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 3 to 11 is not a required part of the basic financial  statements, but is supplementary information required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.   We have applied certain limited procedures that consisted principally of inquiries of management   - 1 -      regarding methods of measurement and presentation of the required supplementary information.  However,  we did not audit the information and we express no opinion or any other form of assurance on it.   Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken  as a whole.  The additional information listed in the foregoing table of contents, which is also the  responsibility of the City’s management, is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a  required part of the basic financial statements.  Such additional information (pages 33 through 36) has  been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the financial statements and, in our  opinion, is fairly presented, in all material respects, when considered in relation to the financial statements  taken as a whole.    The statistical information (pages 37 through 46) is also presented for the purpose of additional analysis  and is not a required part of the basic financial statements.  Such statistical information has not been  subject to auditing procedures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion on it.         June 21, 2006   - 2 -      MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  ($ IN THOUSANDS)   This following discussion and analysis of the Airport’s performance provides an introduction and overview of  the Airport’s financial activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.  Please read this  discussion in conjunction with the Airport’s basic financial statements and the notes to basic financial  statements following this section.   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS   2005  •   Operating revenues for 2005 increased by $6,620 compared to prior year operating revenues.  This  increase is principally due to increased landing fees and other rentals and fueling system charges.   •   •   •   •   Operating expenses before depreciation and amortization increased by $6,696 compared to 2004,  primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance, professional and engineering and other operating  expenses.   The Airport’s total net assets at December 31, 2005 were $308,352.  This is a decrease of $27,568  compared to total net assets at December 31, 2004.   Capital asset additions for 2005 were $64,319, principally due to the Terminal Development Program  construction activities.   Total outstanding revenue bonds, net of unamortized discount and loss on refunding, at December 31,  2005 were $1,259,817.   2004  •   Operating revenues for 2004 increased by $6,635 compared to prior year operating revenues.  This  increase is principally due to increased landing fees and other rentals and fueling system charges.   •   •   •   •   Operating expenses before depreciation and amortization decreased by $1,662 compared to 2003  primarily due to decreased salaries and wages and decreased pension costs.   The Airport’s total net assets at December 31, 2004 were $335,920.  This is a decrease of $1,248  compared to total net assets at December 31, 2003.   Capital asset additions for 2004 were $102,293, principally due to the Terminal Development Program  construction activities.   Total outstanding revenue bonds and notes, net of unamortized discount and loss on refunding, at  December 31, 2004 were $1,265,485.   OVERVIEW OF THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Airport’s basic financial statements.   The Airport’s basic financial statements are comprised of the financial statements and the notes to financial   - 3 -      statements.  In addition to the basic financial statements this report also presents additional and statistical  information after the notes to basic financial statements.   The Statements of Net Assets present all of the Airport’s assets and liabilities using the accrual basis of  accounting, which is similar to the accounting used by private-sector companies.  The difference between  assets and liabilities is reported as net assets.  The increase or decrease in net assets may serve as an indicator,  over time, whether the Airport’s financial position is improving or deteriorating.  However, the consideration  of other non-financial factors such as changes within the airline industry may be necessary in the assessment  of overall financial position and health of the Airport.   The Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Assets present all current fiscal year revenues and  expenses, regardless of when cash is received or paid, and the ensuing change in net assets.   The Statements of Cash Flows report how cash and cash equivalents are provided and used by the Airport’s  operating, capital financing and investing activities.  These statements are prepared on a cash basis and  present the cash received and disbursed, the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year  and the cash and cash equivalents balance at year-end.   The Notes to Basic Financial Statements are an integral part of the basic financial statements; accordingly,  such disclosures are essential to a full understanding of the information provided in the basic financial  statements.     In addition to the basic financial statements, this report includes Additional and Statistical Information.  The  Additional Information section presents debt service coverage calculations and the Statistical Information  section includes certain unaudited information related to the Airport’s historical financial and non-financial  operating results and capital activities.   FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  Landing fees and terminal area use charges and fueling system charges are assessed to the various airlines  throughout each fiscal year based on estimated rates.  Such rates are designed to yield collections from  airlines adequate to cover certain operating expenses and required debt service and fund deposits as  determined under provisions of the Airport Use Agreement and Facilities Leases (Use Agreement).   Incremental amounts due from the airlines arise when amounts assessed, based on the estimated rates used  during the year, are less than actual expenses and required deposits for the year.  Such incremental amounts  due from airlines are included in accrued revenue.  Incremental amounts due to the airlines arise when  amounts assessed, based on the estimated rates used during the year, exceed actual expenses and required  deposits for the year.  Such incremental amounts due to airlines are included in deferred revenue.   - 4 -      2005  Changes in Net Assets  2004  2003  Operating revenues:   Landing fees and terminal area uses     charges   Rents, concessions and other  $                      32,847 59,381  $                      29,299 56,309  $                         26,613 52,360  Total operating revenues              92,228              85,608                78,973  Operating expenses:   Salaries and wages   Repairs and maintenance   Professional and engineering   Other operating expenses   Depreciation and amortization                                                          32,259 31,690 11,274 13,004 35,677                                                          32,316 28,065 10,678 10,472 20,994                                                                      36,582 26,771 9,214 10,626 18,813  Total operating expenses            123,904            102,525              102,006  Operating loss  Nonoperating revenues Nonoperating expenses Capital grants  Increase in net assets             (31,676)            (16,917)              (23,033)                                   34,060 (48,035) 18,083                                  30,694 (36,603) 21,578                                        29,474 (28,244) 17,071  $          (27,568)  $           (1,248)  $            (4,732)     2005  Landing fees and terminal area use charges for the years 2005 and 2004 were $32,847 and $29,299,  respectively.  Rents, concessions and other revenues were $59,381 and $56,309 for the years 2005 and 2004,  respectively.  The increase in 2005 operating revenues of $6,620 (7.7 percent) over 2004 was primarily due to  an increase in terminal use charges and other rentals  and concession revenues of approximately $5,400 and  $1,200 respectively.  Such increases were due to the residual Airport Use Agreement and Facilities Leases  that requires airline revenue to be recognized to the extent necessary to pay the Airport’s operating and  maintenance expenses, net debt service and fund deposit requirements, reduced by non-airline revenues.   Salaries and wages remained flat in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in repairs and maintenance of  $3,625 (12.9 percent) was primarily due to increased shuttle bus service costs ($800), snow removal costs  ($600), water reclamation fees ($400), airfield asphalt repairs ($400), property management costs ($200) and  equipment repair and maintenance costs ($200).  Professional and engineering expenses increased by $596  (5.6 percent) as a result of increased legal fees related to bankruptcies and parking management costs of  approximately $250 and $350, respectively. Other operating expenses increased by $2,532 (24.2 percent)  primarily due to increased insurance costs of approximately $300, increased gas and electric charges of  approximately $900 and $200, respectively, increased de-icer fluid costs of approximately $500, and  increased provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $300.  Depreciation and amortization expense  increased $14,683 (69.9 percent) as a result of the increased capital assets due to activities of the Terminal  Development Program.   Fiscal year 2005 nonoperating revenues of $34,060 are comprised mainly of passenger facility charges  (“PFC”) revenue ($23,292), customer  facility charges (“CFC”) revenue ($2,125) and interest income  ($7,866).  During 2005, nonoperating revenues increased by $3,366 principally due to the increased interest   - 7 -      CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS CHICAGO MIDWAY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT             STATEMENTS OF NET ASSETS DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004 ($ IN THOUSANDS)  ASSETS  2005  2004  LIABILITIES AND NET ASSETS  2005  2004     $                                 53,281 15,232  $                                   39,269 5,994  CURRENT LIABILITIES:  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities  Due to other City funds  Deferred revenue            Total current liabilities  NONCURRENT LIABILITIES:  Liabilities payable from restricted assets (Note 3):    Revenue bond payable (Note 4)    Interest rate swap premium (Note 4)    Accounts payable    Due to other City funds    Interest payable            Total liabilities payable from restricted assets   Revenue bonds payable—net of discount (Note 4)                    55,149            Total noncurrent liabilities                                               100,840 1,007,355 87,678               1,195,873                  113,599               1,082,274  TOTAL LIABILITIES  NET ASSETS (Note 1):  Invested in capital assets—net of related debt   Restricted net assets:    Debt service    Capital projects    Passenger facility charges    Airport use agreement    Other assets               1,654,927           Total restricted net assets  $           1,708,839      Unrestricted net assets                              TOTAL    - 12 -   CURRENT ASSETS:   Cash and cash equivalents (Note 2)   Investments (Note 2)   Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts     of approximately $785 in 2005 and $631 in 2004   Due from other City funds   Prepaid expenses   Interest receivable             Total current assets  NONCURRENT ASSETS:   Restricted assets (Note 3):     Cash and cash equivalents (Note 2)     Investments (Note 2)     Due from other governments     Passenger facility charges receivable (Note 1)     Interest receivable             Total restricted assets  Other assets   Deferred soundproofing & financing fees  Property and facilities (Note 5):   Land   Buildings and other facilities   Construction in progress                        Total property and facilities               Less accumulated depreciation                        Property and facilities—net             Total noncurrent assets  TOTAL  See notes to basic financial statements.  6,776                    1,205                    606                                               62                    53,912  265,096 225,905 21,454 3,329 1,720                                                                                                         517,504                                                                                     6,255 3,625 523 333                    79,249                                                                                               211,578 201,958 58 3,871 1,651                  419,116                    58,206                                             100,903 1,044,383 114,906               1,260,192                  145,300               1,114,892               1,592,214  $           1,671,463                                                                             $                                               14,728 4,400 25,142                  44,270                                                                                     7,340 18,516 15,042 532 24,934                  66,364             1,252,477             1,318,841  $          1,363,111  $               73,843                                                                                1,369 35,941 37,023 42,492 82,706                199,531                  34,978  $             308,352  10,150 2,736 18,455  31,341  $                                                                                                                                                                                                          7,425 19,292 32,911 590 23,300  83,518  1,258,060                  $           1,341,578  1,372,919  105,782    $                                                                                                                                              $              2,442 57,753 51,511 38,728 57,132  207,566  22,572  335,920

Daley, Mayor,  and Members of the City Council  City of Chicago, Illinois   We have audited the accompanying basic financial statements of Chicago O’Hare International Airport  (“O’Hare”) of the City of Chicago, Illinois (City) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and for the years  then ended, listed in the foregoing table of contents.  These financial statements are the responsibility of  the City’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on  our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes consideration of  internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s  internal control over financial reporting for O’Hare.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit  also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial  statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as  well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a  reasonable basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Note 1, the basic financial statements referred to above present only Chicago O’Hare  International Airport and are not intended to present the financial position of the City, the results of its  operations, and its cash flows, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States of America.   In our opinion, such basic financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of Chicago O’Hare International Airport as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its  operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted in the United States of America.   As described in Note 1 to the basic financial statements, O’Hare adopted the provisions of Governmental  Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 40, Deposit and Investment Risk Disclosures, and  Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 42, Accounting and Financial Reporting for  Impairment of Capital Assets and for Insurance Recoveries, as of and for the year ended December 31,  2005.    The Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 3 through 12 is not a required part of the basic  financial statements, but is supplementary information required by the Governmental Accounting  Standards Board.  We have applied certain limited procedures that consisted principally of inquiries of  management regarding methods of measurement and presentation of the required supplementary   - 1 -   information.  However, we did not audit the information and we express no opinion or any other form of  assurance on it.   Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken  as a whole.  The additional information listed in the foregoing table of contents, which is also the  responsibility of the City’s management, is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a  required part of the basic financial statements.  Such additional information (pages 35 through 38) has  been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the financial statements and, in our  opinion, is fairly presented, in all material respects, when considered in relation to the financial statements  taken as a whole.   The statistical information (pages 39 through 50) is also presented for the purpose of additional analysis  and is not a required part of the basic financial statements.  Such statistical information has not been  subjected to auditing procedures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion on it.

Please read this discussion in conjunction with the Airport’s basic  financial statements and the notes to basic financial statements immediately following this section.   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  2005   •  Operating revenues for 2005 increased by $90,308 (20.4 percent) compared to prior year operating   revenues.     •  Operating expenses before depreciation and amortization increased by $34,136 compared to 2004   primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance, professional and utilities costs.   •   •   The Airport’s total net assets at December 31, 2005 were $879,251.  This is an increase of $71,712  (8.9 percent) over total net assets at December 31, 2004.   Capital asset additions for 2005 were $348,225 (19.4 percent increase over 2004) principally due to  land acquisition, terminal improvements, security enhancements, snow dump improvements, runway,  roadway and parking improvements.   •  During 2005, the Airport sold $1,500,000 and $388,343 of Chicago O’Hare International Airport Third   Lien Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2005 A-D and Commercial Paper Notes, respectively.  Total  outstanding revenue bonds and notes, net of unamortized discount and loss on refunding, at  December 31, 2005 were $5,655,285.   2004   •  Operating revenues for 2004 decreased by $39,389 (8.2 percent) compared to prior year operating   revenues.     •  Operating expenses before depreciation and amortization decreased by $13,720 compared to 2003   primarily due to decreased salaries and wages costs.   •   •   The Airport’s total net assets at December 31, 2004 were $807,539.  This is a decrease of $25,614  (3.1 percent) over total net assets at December 31, 2003.   Capital asset additions for 2004 were $291,579 (41.9 percent increase over 2003) principally due to  terminal improvements, heating and refrigeration improvements, airfield drainage projects and runways  and taxiway rehabilitation.   •  During 2004, the Airport sold $385,045 Chicago O’Hare International Airport Third Lien Revenue  Refunding Bonds, Series 2004 A-H.  Total outstanding revenue bonds and notes, net of unamortized  discount and loss on refunding, at December 31, 2004 were $4,017,944.      - 3 -   OVERVIEW OF THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Airport’s basic financial  statements.  The Airport’s basic financial statements are comprised of the financial statements and the notes  to financial statements.  In addition to the basic financial statements this report also presents additional and  statistical information after the notes to basic financial statements.   The Statements of Net Assets present all Airport’s assets and liabilities using the accrual basis of accounting,  which is similar to the accounting used by private-sector companies.  The difference between assets and  liabilities is reported as net assets.  The increase or decrease in net assets may serve as an indicator, over  time, whether the Airport’s financial position is improving or deteriorating.  However, the consideration of  other non-financial factors such as changes within the airline industry may be necessary in the assessment of  overall financial position and health of the Airport.   The Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Assets present all current fiscal year revenues  and expenses, regardless of when cash is received or paid, and the ensuing change in net assets.   The Statements of Cash Flows report how cash and cash equivalents were provided and used by the Airport’s  operating, capital financing and investing activities.  These statements are prepared on a cash basis and  present the cash received and disbursed, the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year  and the cash and cash equivalents balance at year-end.   The Notes to Basic Financial Statements are an integral part of the basic financial statements; accordingly,  such disclosures are essential to a full understanding of the information provided in the basic financial  statements.     In addition to the basic financial statements, this report includes Additional and Statistical Information.  The  Additional Information section presents the debt service coverage calculations and the Statistical Information  section includes certain unaudited information related to the Airport’s historical financial and non-financial  operating results and capital activities.   FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  Landing fees, terminal area use charges and fueling system charges are assessed to the various airlines  throughout each fiscal year based on estimated rates.  Such rates are designed to yield collections from  airlines adequate to cover certain expenses and required debt service and fund deposits as determined under  provisions of the Amended and Restated Airport Use Agreement and Terminal Facilities Lease and the  International Terminal Use Agreement and Facilities Lease (Use Agreements).  Incremental amounts due  from the airlines arise when amounts assessed, based on the estimated rates used during the year, are less  than actual expenses and required deposits for the year.  Such incremental amounts due from airlines are  included in accrued revenue.  Incremental amounts due to the airlines arise when amounts assessed, based on  the estimated rates used during the year, exceed actual expenses and required deposits for the year.  Such  incremental amounts due to airlines are included in deferred revenue.   - 4 -   Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) Revenue—The Airport imposed PFCs of $4.50 per eligible enplaned  passenger for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.  Beginning May 1, 2004, PFCs paid to the  Airport are less allowable airline administrative costs of $.11 per eligible enplaned passenger.   PFCs  are available, subject to Federal Aviation Administration regulation and approval, to finance specific  eligible capital projects.  The City reports PFC revenue as nonoperating revenue and related expenses  as nonoperating expenses in conformity with industry practice.      2.

Certain other investments are held in accordance  with the specific provisions of applicable ordinances.    Credit Risk  The Code limits investments in commercial paper to banks whose senior obligations are  rated in the top two rating categories by at least two national rating agencies and who are required to  maintain such rating during the term of such investment.  The Code also limits investments to  domestic money market mutual funds regulated by, and in good standing with, the Securities and  Exchange Commission.  Certificates of Deposit are also limited by the Code to national banks which  provide collateral of at least 110 percent by marketable U.S. government securities marked to market  at least monthly; or secured by a corporate surety bond issued by an insurance company licensed to  do business in Illinois and having a claims-paying rating in the top rating category, as rated by a  nationally recognized statistical rating organization maintaining such rating during the term of such  investment.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the City’s  management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these basic financial statements based on our  audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of  internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s  internal control over financial reporting for the Sewer Fund. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

We believe that our audits  provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the basic financial statements referred to above present  only the Sewer Fund and are not intended to present the financial position of the City, and the results of its  operations and the cash flows of its proprietary fund types, in conformity with accounting principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.   In our opinion, such basic financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of the Sewer Fund, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows  for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  of America.

Please read this discussion in conjunction with the Sewer Fund’s basic financial  statements and the notes to basic financial statements following this section.   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS   2005  •   Operating revenues for 2005 decreased by $1.5 million compared to prior year operating revenues. This  decrease of 1.0% is primarily due to a reduction in sewer service revenues from suburban customers.   •   •   •   •   Operating expenses before depreciation and amortization increased for 2005 by $3.1 million compared  to 2004. This increase of 3.6% is primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and an increase in  expenses related to repairs and general fund reimbursements.   The Sewer Fund’s total net assets for 2005 increased by $11.6 million (2.6%) compared to 2004.   The Sewer Fund’s total assets were greater than total liabilities by $454.9 million (net assets) at  December 31, 2005. Total net assets comprise $411 million of investment in capital assets, net of related  debt; $43.6 million of unrestricted net assets which may be used for ongoing operations; and $0.3  million of restricted net assets which are restricted for specific purposes.   Capital asset additions for 2005 were $48.4 million, principally due to completion of sewer construction  and rehabilitation projects.   2004  •   Operating revenues for 2004 increased by $2.6 million compared to prior year operating revenues. This  increase of 1.8% is primarily due to a water rate increase of 3% effective January 1, 2004, offset by a  decrease in water usage and the reduction of the number of qualified senior exempt accounts.   •   •   •   Operating expenses before depreciation and amortization decreased for 2004 by $10.0 million compared  to 2003. This decrease of 10.5% is primarily due to lower personnel costs after the early retirement  initiative and other lower related expenses associated with personnel costs.   The Sewer Fund’s total net assets for 2004 increased by $11.8 million (2.7%) compared to year 2003.   The Sewer Fund’s total assets were greater than total liabilities by $443.3 million (net assets) at  December 31, 2004. Total net assets comprise $407.5 million of investment in capital assets, net of  related debt; $23.4 million of unrestricted net assets which may be used for ongoing operations; and  $12.5 million of restricted net assets which are restricted for specific purposes.   - 3 -   •   Capital asset additions for 2004 were $34.6 million, principally due to completion of sewer construction  and rehabilitation projects.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the City’s  management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our  audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

The statistical data is also presented for the purpose of additional analysis and is not a required part of the  basic financial statements. Such statistical data has not been subjected to auditing procedures and,  accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on it.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS   2005  •  Operating revenues for 2005 increased by $16.8 million compared to prior year operating  revenues. This increase is primarily due to the water rate increase of three percent effective  January 1, 2005 and an increase in pumpage/usage during the summer season.   •  Operating expenses before depreciation and amortization increased by $21.3 million compared to  2004 due to increases in  the gas rate as well as consumption, increase in salary due to new labor  contracts and increase in indirect costs.    •  The Water Fund’s total net assets at December 31, 2005 were $942.7 million. This is an increase   of $23.6 million over total net assets at December 31, 2004   •  Total utility plant increased in 2005 by $102 million due to the continuing capital improvement   program.   2004  •  Operating revenues for 2004 increased by $10.1 million compared to prior year operating  revenues. This increase is principally due to the water rate increase of three percent and an  increase in the full payment certificate fee from $10 to $25, effective January 1, 2004.   •  Operating expenses before depreciation and amortization decreased by $23.3 million compared to   2003 primarily due to early retirement program resulting in a decrease in salaries of $24.0  million.   •  The Water Fund’s total net assets at December 31, 2004 were $919.1 million. This is an increase   of $35.1 million over total net assets at December 31, 2003.   •  Total utility plant increased in 2004 by $128.1 million, due to the continuing capital improvement   program.   - 3 -   OVERVIEW OF THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Water Fund’s basic financial  statements. The Water Fund’s basic financial statements comprise the Financial Statements and the Notes to  Financial Statements. In addition to the basic financial statements this report also presents Additional  Information and Statistical Data after the Notes to Basic Financial Statements.   The Statements of Net Assets present all of the Water Fund’s assets and liabilities using the accrual basis of  accounting, which is similar to the accounting used by private-sector companies. The difference between  assets and liabilities is reported as net assets. The increase or decrease in net assets may serve as an indicator,  over time, whether the Water Fund’s financial position is improving or deteriorating.    The Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Assets present all current year revenues and  expenses, regardless of when cash is received or paid, and the ensuing change in net assets.   The Statements of Cash Flows report how cash and cash equivalents are provided and used by the Water  Fund’s operating, capital financing and investing activities. These statements are prepared on a cash basis and  present the cash received and disbursed, the net increase or decease in cash and cash equivalents for the year  and the cash and cash equivalents balance at year-end.   The Notes to Basic Financial Statements are an integral part of the financial statements; accordingly, such  disclosures are essential to a full understanding of the information provided in the financial statements. The  Notes to Basic Financial Statements begin on page 16.   In addition to the basic financial statements, this report included Additional Information and Statistical Data.  The Additional Information section presents a schedule of utility plant. The Statistical Data section presents  unaudited debt service coverage calculations and certain unaudited information related to the Water Fund’s  nonfinancial data and capital activities.   - 4 -   Construction Account—Certain proceeds of the Series 2001, 2000, 1997, and 1995 Bonds were  deposited in this account for the purpose of paying construction costs of projects as defined in the  ordinance.   Rebate Account—Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Act), the City has entered into an arbitrage  agreement under which the City will comply with certain requirements of the Act to maintain the  tax-exempt status of the bonds. The Rebate account has been established to account for any liability  resulting from the Act.   Water Revenue Bonds, Series 2000 and Refunding Bonds, Series 2004 and 2001 (Second Lien Bonds)   Principal and Interest Account—Deposits are required to be transferred no later than the business day  preceding each May 1 and November 1, in an amount sufficient to pay principal and interest as due on  outstanding Second Lien Bonds.   Second Lien Bonds Account—On the date of issuance of any Series of Second Lien Bonds that bear  interest at a variable rate paying interest more than semiannually, an amount equal to the interest payable  during a six-month period will be transferred to a restricted account. The amount transferred will be  calculated based on the maximum rate payable on such bonds.   Rebate Account—Amounts required to make rebate payments, to the United States of America in  connection with interest or other related investment earnings, if any, related to the Second Lien Bonds.   Construction Account—Certain proceeds of the Series 2000 Bonds were deposited in this account for  the purpose of paying construction costs of projects as defined in the ordinance.   Water Rate Stabilization Account   Any net revenues remaining after providing sufficient funds for all required deposits in the Water  Revenue Bonds accounts may be transferred to the Water Rate Stabilization Account upon the direction  of the City to be used for any lawful purpose of the Water Fund.   For accounts established by ordinances with balances, the amounts at December 31, 2005 and 2004, are  as follows (in thousands of dollars):   Senior Lien Debt Service Reserve Second Lien Bonds Water rate stabilization Construction             Total  2005  2004  $                         7,098 26,287 52,298 66,223  $     7,098     25,375     52,298   116,550  151,906 $   $  201,321     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Water Fund was in compliance with the funding requirements and  restrictions on assets as stated in the ordinances.   - 21 -

The nation's financial environment of the last several years has presented extraordinary  challenges for local governments around the country. The City of Chicago has experienced a dramatic decrease in revenues during this time and in order to maintain the levels of service that are consistent with the demands and expectations of our citizens we must continue to institute strong management initiatives to ensure that we match our responsibilities to available revenues.  This is a time of great opportunity to address the structural deficits in the City budget and  to lay the foundation for a strong financial future. The decisions we make now will shape the direction of the city for decades to come.  Together. we will make government more effective. deliver better services more  affordably. and enhance the city's programs, economic growth and sustainability to ensure that Chicago remains a world-class city.  Sincerely,  CITY OF CHICAGO THE CITY COUNCIL As of June 29, 2011  RAHM EMANUEL, Mayor  JOE MORENO ROBERT FIORETTI PAT DOWELL WILLIAM D. BURNS LESLIE A. HAIRSTON RODERICK T.

In  2013,  the  City  of  Chicago  made  significant  progress  towards  righting  the  City's  financial  ship.  We  have  reduced  our  structural  deficit  by  making  city  government  smaller,  smarter, and simpler.  For the third consecutive year, the City enhanced  its long term financial  outlook by contributing millions of dollars to its reserve fund. In addition, we have taken steps to  address the city's  long-term fiscal liabilities such as pensions in a responsible way that protects  taxpayers and meets our obligations to employees and retirees.   Last year, we also made strategic investments in neighborhoods across the city to ensure  Chicago  remains  an  ideal  place  to  live,  work,  and  raise  a  family,  and  also  visit  or  do  business.   It is important we recognize that while significant progress was made in 2013, we must  continue  our  work  to  strengthen  Chicago's  future  by  reforming  city  government,  making  investments  in  our  neighborhoods,  and  providing  our  residents  with  the  high  quality  services  they rely upon- all in a fiscally responsible way.                                           Mayor         CITY OF CHICAGO  THE CITY COUNCIL   As of December 31, 2013  RAHM EMANUEL, Mayor          Ward  .........................................................................................................................................

State Law  requires  that  all  governmental  units  publish  within  six  months  of  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  financial  statements  presented  in  conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles (""GAAP"") and audited  by a licensed public accountant.   Responsibility for both the accuracy of the data and completeness , and fairness  of  the  presentation, including  all  disclosures, rests  with  the  City  of  Chicago  (""City"")  Chicago  Department of Aviation  and Comptroller's  Office. The purpose  of the CAFR is to provide complete and accurate information that complies with  reporting  International  Airport's  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis (""MD&A"")  can  be  found  immediately  following  the  independent  auditors'  report.   requirements.  The  Chicago  Midway   ECONOMIC  CONDITION AND  OUTLOOK   that  generally  specialize   The Airport  provides  regional travelers  with  access  to  service  by a  number  of  airlines  in  low-fare,  point-to-point,  origin    and  destination  (""O&D"") passenger service.  The Airport's  major attributes that allow  it to  enjoy  a  unique  market  niche  include the Airport's  location  proximate to  a  large  O&D  passenger  base,  its  accessibility ,  and  its  low  per-passenger  cost  structure. In 2013,  Midway's passenger  enplanements  grew  by 5.0 percent -  making  Midway one of the fastest growing  large hub airports  in the country. In  fact, 2013 was the busiest year in Midway's 86-year history - a major milestone  for  an  airport when  the aviation  industry  is still recovering the global economic  crisis . .   Given  these  factors, along  with  the  projections  for  air  travel  demand in  the  region, there  is a strong economic  outlook for the Airport.   2  105 10  W E ST  Z E M K E  R O A D ,  P  0 .

In addition, the Airport  is near the center of the Chicago region's  population. This geographic  advantage  is further  enhanced  by the existence  of  an extensive  highway and passenger  rail network  providing convenient  access  to  the  Airport.  The  Airport  occupies  approximately 840  acres  in slightly  more  than a one-mile  square  area.   MAJOR  INITIATIVES   The  City  has  made  significant  investment  in  Midway  to  address  demand,  security,  safety  and  community  relations.  With  the  completion  of  the  terminal  development  program and the opening of a new parking garage in the economy  lot, we  have addressed  the continually  increasing demand  at the Airport.   In 2013,  Midway completed the Consolidated  Rental Car Facility and additional  airfield  rehabilitation  projects.  Since  1996,  the  Department  of  Aviation  at  Midway  has  invested $325  million in  noise  mitigation  projects including  the  sound insulation of 41 schools and more than 8,000 residents in the community  near  Midway.   In 2012,  Midway completed  a rehabilitation  of the airside service  road and the  installation  of  new  runway  centerline  and  threshold  lighting  systems  for  both  ends  of  Runway 4R-22L.   The future ongoing capital program also includes the noise mitigation projects,  cyclical rehabilitations of the major runways and taxiways in order to maintain  and enhance operational capability, operational efficiency and greater airfield  safety.   The City is financing the capital program through bond proceeds, federal grants,  passenger  facility  charge  revenues  and  other  available Airport  funds.   FINANCIAL  INFORMATION   The Departments of Finance and Aviation are responsible for implementing and  maintaining an internal control structure to ensure the integrity of the Airport's  operations and to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity  with generally accepted accounting principles. The internal control structure is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  the  assets,  resources  and  operations of the Airport are handled in a manner that protects against waste,  theft or neglect and other irregularities that may hinder the operations of the   3  Airport. This  objective  is  being  met  by  adequate  supervision  of  employees,  segregation  of duties and  multiple approvals  of expenditures.   The Airport's  budget  is developed  in connection  with  the City's  annual  budget  and is based on an analysis  of the Airport's  historical operating  expenses. The  Commissioner  of Aviation  recommends the final proposed budget to the Budget  Director.  After  approval  by  the  Budget  Director,  the  proposed  budget  is  recommended  to the  Mayor for  submission  to the  City  Council for  its approval  following  public  hearings.   The  budget  process  is designed  to  ensure that  the Airport  will  have adequate  funding  to  meet  its operational  objectives.  The Airport  cannot,  by  law, exceed  the  level  of  funding  as  established  by the  City  Council-approved  budget.  The  Budget  Director  uses  an  allotment  system  to  manage  each  department's  expenditures against its respective annual appropriations. The Budget Director,  through the allotment  system,  has the authority to institute economic measures  for  the  Airport  to  ensure  that  its  expenditures  do  not  exceed  its  revenue  collection.  The  Airport  uses  encumbrances  to  control  expenditures  by  preventing appropriated dollars from being used for any purpose other than that  for which  they  have been legally appropriated.   RELEVANT  FINANCIAL  POLICIES   The Airport  is owned  by the  City and operated  by the  Chicago  Department  of  Aviation (""CDA"") and is accounted for as a self-supporting enterprise fund of the  City.  The  City  maintains  the  books, records  and  accounts of  the  Airport  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  as  required  by  the  provisions  of the Airport  Use Agreements,  the  Bond Ordinance,  and  Bond  Indentures as supplemented  and  amended.   The Airport  Use Agreements  specify a residual rate-making methodology for the  calculation of airline rates and charges.  Under this methodology, total operating  and  maintenance  expenses  and  debt  service  (including  coverage)    are  calculated for each cost-revenue center and offset by nonairline revenues. The  Airport  Use  Agreements  provide  that  the  aggregate  of  Airport  Fees  and  Charges  paid by the Airline  Parties must be sufficient to  pay for the  net cost of  operating,  maintaining  and developing  the Airport,  including the satisfaction  of  Debt  Service  coverage,  deposit  and  payment  requirements  of  the  Bond  Ordinance  and the  Indentures.   INDEPENDENT  AUDIT   The  Midway  bond  indentures  require the Airport  financial  statements  to  be  audited by independent certified public accountants. The audit was conducted  by Deloitte & Touche LLP and a consortium of Chicago-based minority and   4  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED)  ($ IN THOUSANDS)   This following discussion and analysis of the Chicago Midway International Airport’s (Airport) performance  provides an introduction and overview of the Airport’s financial activities for the years ended December 31,  2013 and 2012. Please read this discussion in conjunction with the Airport’s basic financial statements and  the notes to basic financial statements following this section. Due to the implementation of GASB  Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities (“GASB 65”), in fiscal year 2013,  as described in Note 11 to the basic financial statements, 2012 and 2011 numbers within the  management’s discussion and analysis have been restated retroactively.   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS   2013   • Operating revenues for 2013 increased by $17,356 compared to 2012 operating revenues.  • Operating expenses before depreciation and amortization increased by $6,819 compared to 2012,  primarily due to an increase in other operating expenses and professional and engineering services.  • The Airport’s total net position at December 31, 2013 was $14,983. This is a decrease of $14,817  compared to total net position at December 31, 2012. Due to the residual Airport Use Agreement, this decrease is mainly due to timing differences between depreciation on property and facilities and cash requirements required for debt service.  • Capital asset additions for 2013 were $45,573, principally due to land acquisition, terminal  improvements, parking and roadway enhancements, and runway improvements.  2012   • Operating revenues for 2012 increased by $462 compared to 2011 operating revenues.  • Operating expenses before depreciation and amortization increased by $4,208 compared to 2011,  primarily due to an increase in other operating expenses offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance.  • The Airport’s total net position at December 31, 2012 was $29,800. This is a decrease of $28,724  compared to total net position at December 31, 2011.  • Capital asset additions for 2012 were $64,841, principally due to land acquisition, terminal  improvements, parking and roadway enhancements, and runway improvements.  OVERVIEW OF THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Airport’s basic financial statements.  The Airport is included in the City of Chicago’s (City) reporting entity as an enterprise fund. The Airport’s  basic financial statements are composed of the basic financial statements and the notes to basic financial  statements. In addition to the basic financial statements, this report also presents additional and statistical  information after the notes to basic financial statements.   - 11 -   "

Net position comprises $520.6 million of net  investment in capital assets, $111.3 million of restricted for capital projects, and $102.8 million of  unrestricted.   •  Capital asset additions, net, being depreciated for 2014 were $210.4 million, principally due to   completion of sewer construction and rehabilitation projects.   •   In March 2014, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) downgraded the ratings of the Wastewater  senior lien revenue bonds from A1 to A2 and the Wastewater second lien revenue bonds from A2 to  A3, each with a negative outlook.   •  At December 31, 2014, the Sewer Fund was in compliance with the debt covenants as stated in the   Master Trust Indentures. Details regarding the Sewer Fund’s long-term debt are in Note 4 of the notes  to the basic financial statements.   OVERVIEW OF THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Sewer Fund’s basic financial  statements. The Sewer Fund’s basic financial statements comprise the basic financial statements and the notes  to basic financial statements. In addition to the basic financial statements, this report also presents statistical  data after the notes to basic financial statements.   The statements of net position present all of the Sewer Fund’s assets, deferred outflows, and liabilities using  the accrual basis of accounting. The difference between assets, deferred outflows, and liabilities is reported as  net position. The increase or decrease in net position may serve as an indicator, over time, whether the Sewer  Fund’s financial position is improving or deteriorating. However, the consideration of other nonfinancial  factors may be necessary in the assessment of overall financial position and health of the Sewer Fund.   The statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position present all current fiscal year revenues and  expenses, regardless of when cash is received or paid, and the ensuing change in net position.   The statements of cash flows report how cash and cash equivalents were provided and used by the Sewer  Fund’s operating, capital financing, and investing activities. These statements are prepared on a cash basis  and present the cash received and disbursed, the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the  year, and the cash and cash equivalents balance at year-end.   The notes to basic financial statements are an integral part of the basic financial statements; accordingly, such  disclosures are essential for a full understanding of the information provided in the basic financial statements.   In addition to the basic financial statements, this report includes statistical data. The statistical data section  presents unaudited debt-service coverage calculations and includes certain unaudited information related to  the Sewer Fund’s historical financial and nonfinancial operating results and capital activities.   - 10 -

A comparative condensed summary of the Water Fund’s net position at  December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, is as follows:   (In thousands)  Current assets Restricted and other assets Utility plant—net Deferred outflows  2015  $                        806,467 145,667 3,822,825 751,081  Net Position  2014  2013  $                                            542,748 390,988 3,482,199 129,229  $                                        423,372 110,593 3,181,856 111,907  Total assets and deferred outflows  $   5,526,040  $        4,545,164  $       3,827,728  Current liabilities Long-term liabilities  Deferred inflows  Total liabilities  Net position:   Net investment in capital assets   Restricted for capital projects   Unrestricted  Total net position  2015   $                   383,371 4,180,106 11,050  $          305,342          2,556,616                          246,266 $                 2,134,485                         $   4,574,527  $        2,861,958  $       2,380,751  $                       1,514,009 677 (563,173)  $                                       1,393,968 599 288,639  $                                    1,233,185 719 213,073  $      951,513  $        1,683,206  $       1,446,977     Current assets of $806.5 million at December 31, 2015, increased by $263.7 million (48.6%) over 2014 as a  result of increases in cash and cash equivalents of $286.3, investments of $21.7 million offset by a decrease in  due from other City funds of $57.6 million. Restricted and other assets decreased by $245.3 million (62.7%)  due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2014. In addition, utility plant—net, increased by $340.6 million  (9.8%) due to increased projects performed through the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in  deferred outflows of $621.9 million (481.2%) during 2015 is mainly due to the implementation of GASB 68.   The increase in current liabilities of $78.0 million (25.6%) during 2015 is directly related to the timing of  payments of accounts payable and increases in accrued liabilities and in current portion of long-term debt.  Noncurrent liabilities increased by $1,623.5 million (63.5%) mainly due to net pension liability of $1,646.4  resulting from the implementation of GASB 68 offset by a decrease in long term debt payable of  $16.7 million.   - 12 -

Interest  incurred during the construction phase of capital assets of business-type activities is included as part of  the  capitalization  value  of  the  assets  constructed.    The  total  interest  expense  (Governmental  and  Business  Activities)  incurred  by  the  City  during  the  current  fiscal  year  was  $1,096.6  million,  of  which  $49.2 million was capitalized as part of the capital assets under construction projects in proprietary funds.   Property,  plant,  and  equipment  of  the  City  are  depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method,  in  the  year  subsequent to acquisition or when placed into service, over the following estimated useful lives:     Utility plant...................................................................................... 25 - 100 years 50 - 100 years Utility structures and improvements............................................... 10 -   40 years Buildings and improvements.......................................................... Airport runways, aprons, tunnels, taxiways, and paved roads....... 30 years Bridge infrastructure....................................................................... 10 -   40 years Lighting infrastructure..................................................................... 25 years 10 -   25 years Street infrastructure....................................................................... Transit infrastructure...................................................................... 25 -   40 years 5 -   20 years   Equipment (vehicle, office, and computer) ....................................     The City has a collection of artwork and historical treasures presented for public exhibition and education  that are being preserved for future generations.  The proceeds from sales of any pieces of the collection  are used to purchase other acquisitions.  A portion of this collection is not capitalized or depreciated as  part of capital assets.     vi)  Deferred  Outflows  represent  unamortized  loss  on  bond  refundings,  the  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  that  are  deemed  to  be  effective  hedges,  differences  between  estimated  and  actual  investment earnings related to pensions, changes in actuarial assumptions related to pensions and other  pension related changes.     vii) Employee  Benefits  are  granted  for  vacation  and  sick  leave,  workers’  compensation  and  health  care.   Unused  vacation  leave  is  accrued  and  may  be  partially  carried  over  for  one  year.  Sick  leave  is  accumulated at the rate of one day for each month worked, up to a maximum of 200 days.  Severance of  employment terminates all rights to receive compensation for any unused sick leave.  Sick leave pay is  not  accrued.    Employee  benefit  claims  outstanding,  including  claims  incurred  but  not  reported,  are  estimated and recorded in the government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements.  A liability for  these amounts is reported in governmental funds only if they have matured, for example, as a result of  employee resignations and retirements.    Employees  are  eligible  to  defer  a  portion  of  their  salaries  until  future  years  under  the  City’s  deferred  compensation  plan  created  in  accordance  with  Internal  Revenue  Code  Section  457.    The  deferred  compensation  is  not  available  to  employees  until  termination,  retirement,  death  or  unforeseeable  emergency.  Third-party administrators who maintain the investment portfolio administer the Plan.  The  plan’s assets have been placed in trust accounts with the plan administrators for the exclusive benefit of  participants and their beneficiaries and are not considered assets of the City.    The  City  is  subject  to  the  State  of  Illinois  Unemployment  Compensation  Act  and  has  elected  the  reimbursing  employer  option  for  providing  unemployment  insurance  benefits  for  eligible  former  employees.  Under this option, the City reimburses the State for claims paid by the State.  Expenditures  for  workers’  compensation  are  recorded  when  paid  in  the  governmental  funds.    A  liability  for  these  amounts is recorded in the government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements.     56

If minimum credit rating  requirements are not maintained, the counterparty is required to post collateral to a third  party. This protects the Airport by mitigating the credit risk, and therefore the ability to  pay a termination payment, inherent in a swap. Collateral on all swaps is to be in the form  of cash or eligible collateral held by a third-party custodian. Upon credit events, the swaps  also allow transfers, credit support, and termination, if the counterparty is unable to meet  the said credit requirements.   Basis Risk—Basis risk refers to the mismatch between the variable rate payments  received on a swap contract and the interest payment actually owed on the bonds. The  two significant components driving this risk are credit and Securities Industry and  Financial Markets Associations (SIFMA) ratios. Credit may create basis risk because the  Airport’s bonds may trade differently than the swap index as a result of a credit change in  the Airport. SIFMA ratios (or spreads) may create basis risk if SIFMA swaps of the  Airport’s bonds trade higher than the SIFMA received on the swap. This can occur due to  many factors including, without limitations, changes in marginal tax rates, tax-exempt  status of bonds, and supply and demand for variable rate bonds. The Airport is exposed to  basis risk on the swaps if the rate paid on the bonds is higher than the rate received. The  Airport is liable for the difference. The difference would need to be available on the debt  service payment date and would add additional underlying cost to the transaction.   Tax Risk—The swap exposes the Airport to tax risk or a permanent mismatch (shortfall)  between the floating rate received on the swap and the variable rate paid on the  underlying variable-rate bonds due to tax law changes such that the Federal or State tax  exception of municipal debt is eliminated or its value reduced. There have been no tax law  changes since the execution of this swap agreement.   Termination Risk—The risk that the swap could be terminated as a result of certain  events, including a ratings downgrade for the issuer or swap counterparty, covenant  violation, bankruptcy, payment default, or other defined events of default. Termination of  a swap may result in a payment made by the issuer or to the issuer depending upon the  market at the time of termination.   Swap Payments and Associated Debt—As of December 31, 2016, debt service  requirements for the Airport’s outstanding variable-rate debt and net swap payments,  assuming current interest rates remain the same, for their term are as follows ($  in thousands):   Years Ending December 31  2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022–2026 2027–2031 2032–2036  Total  Variable-Rate Bonds  with Swaps  Principal  Interest Swaps—Net  Interest  Rate  $                                                 4,575 4,775 5,000 5,225 5,350 31,050 38,600 37,625  $                                                         982 945 907 867 826 3,441 2,087 473  $                                       4,399 4,235 4,064 3,885 3,701 15,413 9,348 2,119  Total  $                                                 9,956 9,955 9,971 9,977 9,877 49,904 50,035 40,217  $   132,200  $   10,528  $   47,164  $   189,892     40

State  law  requires  that  all  governmental units publish within six months of the close of each fiscal year financial statements presented  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  and  audited  by  a  licensed  public  accountant.    Responsibility  for  both  the  accuracy  of  the  data  and  completeness  and  fairness  of  the  presentation,  including all disclosures, rests with the City of Chicago (“City”) Department of Aviation and Comptroller’s  Office.  The  purpose  of  the  CAFR  is  to  provide  complete  and  accurate  information  that  complies  with  reporting requirements. The Chicago O’Hare International Airport’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis  (“MD&A”) can be found immediately following the independent auditors’ report.    ECONOMIC CONDITION AND OUTLOOK    According  to  preliminary  2016  statistics  compiled  by  Airports  Council  International,  the  Airport  was  the  second busiest airport in the world in 2016, as measured by total aircraft operations and the sixth busiest  by  total  passengers.  In  North  America,  the  Airport  was  the  sixth  busiest  airport  in  terms  of  total  cargo  tonnage handled. According to the  Official Airline Guide, as of December 31, 2016, nonstop service was  provided from the Airport to 238 destinations, consisting of 170 domestic airports and 68 foreign airports.  Given the strength and diversity of the economic base of the region and the resulting high demand for air  transportation services, combined with record breaking passenger activity in 2016, it is expected that the  Airport will remain a major air traffic connecting hub, with a substantial number of airlines providing flights to  all major domestic locations as well as an increasing number of international destinations.   REPORTING ENTITY    The Airport is the primary commercial airport for the City, and the region, as well as an important transfer  and  connecting  point  for  numerous  domestic  and  international  flights.  Located  18  miles  northwest  of  the  City’s  central  business  district,  the  Airport  occupies  approximately  7,265  acres  of  land.  The  Airport  is  accessed  by  a  network  of  highways,  including  several  regional  expressways  that  are  part  of  the  federal  Interstate  Highway  System,  and  is  directly  linked  to  the  central  business  district  by  a  rapid  transit  rail  system.         The airlines servicing the Airport operate out of four terminal buildings. Three domestic terminal buildings,  having  a  total  of  167  gates,  serve  domestic  flights  and  certain  international  departures  as  of  December  2016.  The  International  Terminal,  having  a  total  of  21  gates  and  four  remote  aircraft  parking  positions,  serves the remaining international departures and all arrivals requiring customs clearance.    MAJOR INITIATIVES    The  centerpiece  of  capital  development  at  the  Airport  is  the  O’Hare  Modernization  Program  (OMP),  launched  in  2004  to  preserve  and  enhance  safety  and  efficient  operations  for  the  more  than  70  million  passengers  traveling  through  the  Airport  each  year.  The  OMP  is  designed  to  improve  capacity  of  the  Airport,  as  well  as  the  national  air  transportation  system  by:  reducing  delays;  providing  sufficient airfield,  landside,  and  support  facilities  to  accommodate  existing  and  future  passenger  and  cargo  demand;  providing  efficient  surface  access  for  existing  and  future  Airport  users;  and  providing  opportunities  for  enhanced competition among air carriers.      This program consists of the development of one new runway at the Airport, the relocation of three existing  runways, and the extension of two existing runways at an estimated cost of $5.5   billion dollars.     Improvements  made  by  the  OMP  are  designed  to  reduce  weather  delays  by  95  percent,  reduce  overall  delays  by  70  percent  and  meet  projected  aviation  demand  beyond  2030.  To  date,  improvements  made  have substantially reduced airfield and airspace delays. In fact, capacity has improved by 50 percent, and  measured  delays  are reduced by  57  percent.  These  improvements  have  a  direct  impact  not  only  for  travelers in and out of Chicago, but impact the efficiency of the broader national airspace system as well.    In 2016, the City of Chicago, with support by its federal partners and airline carriers, announced a nearly  $1.3 billion infrastructure plan to build on the ongoing work of the OMP. This investment directs resources  toward construction of Airport’s newest runway, 9C-27C, deicing pads and other critical airfield projects for  further  airport  improvements  that  will  allow  Airport  to  increase  the  number  of  gates  and  modernize  the  terminals. With this latest investment and the final phase of Airport’s newest runway, 9C-27C expected to  be completed in 2020, OMP is on pace to be completed in 2021.    The Airport began construction on a Multimodal facility that will include a Consolidated Rental Car Facility,  Public Parking and the extension of the Airport Transit System. In addition to the above, the City is also  implementing an ongoing five-year Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for the Airport. The CIP includes airfield  improvements,  noise  mitigation  projects,  parking  and  roadway  improvements,  heating  and  refrigeration  plant  improvements,  safety  and  security  improvements,  other  terminal  enhancements  and  planning  initiatives.     In summer 2016, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the CDA announced O’Hare 21  - a multi-billion dollar capital  investment program at the Airport that expands Terminal 5, redevelops     Terminal  2,  creates  space  for  new  gates,  adds  three  hotel  development  projects  and  supports  tens  of  thousands of jobs and economic opportunities in Chicago.     The  City  expects  these  capital  programs  will  be  funded  from  the  following  sources:  proceeds  of  airport  revenue bonds, Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) revenues on a pay-as-you-go basis, PFC-backed bonds,  federal grants, a TIFIA loan and other available Airport funds.           FINANCIAL INFORMATION    The  Departments  of  Finance  and  Aviation  are  responsible  for  implementing  and  maintaining  an  internal  control  structure  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  Airport’s  operations  and  to  allow  for  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted accounting  principles. As  the  cost  of a  control  should not exceed the benefits to be derived, the internal control structure is designed provide reasonable,  rather than absolute, assurance to all stakeholders that the financial statements reflect operations free of  theft,  neglect  or  material  misstatements  that  could  affect  the  efficiency  of  operations  at  the  Airport.  This  objective  is  being  met  by  adequate  supervision  of  employees,  segregation  of  the  duties  and  multiple  approval and budgetary controls over all expenditures.    The Airport’s budget is developed in connection with the City’s annual budget and is based on an analysis  of  the  Airport’s  historical  operating  expenses.  The  Commissioner  of  Aviation  recommends  the  final  proposed  budget  to  the  Budget  Director.    After  approval  by  the  Budget  Director,  the  proposed  budget  is  recommended to the Mayor for submission to the City Council for its approval following public hearings.    The budget process is designed to ensure that the Airport will have adequate funding for operations. The  Airport cannot, by law, exceed the level of funding as established by the City Council-approved budget. The  Budget  Director  uses  an  allotment  system  to  manage  each  department’s  expenditures  against  its  respective  annual  appropriation.  The  Budget  Director,  through  the  allotment  system,  has  the  authority  to  institute  economic  measures  for  the  Airport  to  ensure  that  its  expenditures  do  not  exceed  its  revenue  collection. The Airport uses encumbrances to control expenditures by preventing appropriated dollars from  being used for any purpose other than that for which they have been legally appropriated.    RELEVANT FINANCIAL POLICIES    The  Airport  is  owned  by  the  City  and  operated  by  the  Chicago  Department  of  Aviation  (CDA)  and  is  accounted for as a self-supporting enterprise fund of the City. The City maintains the books, records and  accounts of the Airport in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and as required by the  provisions of the Airport Use Agreements, the Bond Ordinance and Bond Indentures as supplemented and  amended.    The Airport Use Agreements specify a residual rate-making methodology for the calculation of airline rates  and  charges.    Under  this  methodology,  total  operating  and  maintenance  expenses  and  debt  service  (including coverage) are calculated for each cost-revenue center and offset by non-airline revenues. The  Airport Use Agreements provide that the aggregate of Airport Fees and Charges paid by the Airline Parties  must be sufficient to pay for the net cost of operating, maintaining and developing the Airport (excluding the  Land Support Area) including the satisfaction of Debt Service coverage, deposit and payment requirements  of the Bond Ordinance and the Indentures.    INDEPENDENT AUDIT         Various  bond  indentures  require  the  Airport  financial  statements  to  be  audited  by  independent  certified  public  accountants.  The  audit  was  conducted  by  Deloitte  &  Touche  LLP  and  a  consortium  of  Chicago- based minority and women-owned certified public accounting firms. An unqualified audit opinion, rendered  by Deloitte & Touche LLP, is included in the financial section of this report.        costs, materials and supplies, utilities, vehicle purchases, and the provision for doubtful  accounts.   The 2015 nonoperating revenues of $224,544 are comprised of Passenger Facility Charges  (PFC) $147,697, Customer Facility Charges (CFC) of $39,204 and other nonoperating  revenue of $18,315 and investment income of $19,328.   Nonoperating expenses of $342,153 and $320,971 for the years 2015 and 2014,  respectively, were comprised primarily of bond interest, PFC expenses noise mitigating costs  and costs of issuance. The increase of $9,741 (3%) for 2015 over 2014 was mainly due to  increased interest expense offset by decrease in PFC noise mitigation and cost of issuance.   Capital grants, comprised mainly of federal grants, decreased from $89,032 in 2014 to  $76,689 in 2015, a 13.9% decrease mainly as a result of less federal grant reimbursements  in 2015.

This deferred amount will be recognized as a pension benefit over a period  of three years.   Actuarial Assumptions—The total pension liability in the December 31, 2016 and 2015  actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all  periods included in the measurement:   Municipal  Laborers’  Inflation Salary increases Investment rate of return  (a) Varying by years of service  (b) Plus a service—based increase in the first 15 years  (c)  Net of investment expense  (d) Net of investment expense, including inflation           3.00 %  4.5%-8.25% (a) (c)  7.50 %     3.00 %    3.75 %    7.50 %     (b)  (d)  Mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Health Annuitant Mortality Table for Males or  Females, as appropriate.

Contributions Unbundled for Medical, Dental and Vision Enrollment for dental or vision coverage is now separate from  the medical plan.  Take no action during open enrollment if you  want to continue your current coverage.  The dental and vision  coverage  has  been  improved  for  2017  and  separate  payroll  deductions will be taken for each plan.

The second opinion requirement is  waived if you are admitted to the hospital for surgery from the  emergency room.  ASK A MEDICAL EXPERT - BEST DOCTORS  PROGRAM A pilot program for PPO members who have questions or  concerns about a medical condition or treatment.  Call Best  Doctors  to  get  written  answers  from  medical  specialists,  at no charge.  Best Doctors also offers an expert second  opinion  for  all  surgeries,  in  addition  to  the  surgeries  mandated  by  the  second  surgical  opinion  listed  above.  They  also  offer  reviews  for  complex  conditions  or  when  treatment  does  not  appear  to  help  resolve  the  medical  condition.    VIRTUAL DOCTOR’S VISITS – DOCTORS ON  DEMAND PPO  members  can  have  a  virtual  “face-to-face”  medical  evaluation  by  a  primary  care  physician  using  a  phone,  tablet or computer with a front facing camera.  The Doctors  on Demand pilot program submits claims directly to Blue  Cross and you pay a $20 co-pay for the visit.  Prescriptions  are sent to a local pharmacy, Value Formulary and copays  apply.  COMPREHENSIVE CARE PHYSICIAN MODEL  The University of Chicago’s Comprehensive Care Physician  (CCP)  program  offers  PPO  members  the  opportunity  to  have the same doctor in the hospital and the doctor’s office  in a two year pilot program.  PPO members are eligible for  the  CCP  program  if  they  have  been  hospitalized  once  in  the  past  year.

This plan will be  administered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois and includes  the same network of providers (doctors and hospitals) as the  current  medical  PPO  plan.    The  difference  is  that  the  Blue  Choice OPT PPO adds a third provider network with enhanced  benefit coverage levels.  This means the PPO plan for 2017  will have three different network choices called Tiers:    Tier 1   Blue Choice OPT PPO – a narrow network with the   lowest out-of-pocket costs   Tier 2   Blue Cross PPO  – includes the same “in-network”  providers (doctors and hospitals) as the current plan.  Tier 3   Out-of-network – no cost savings and highest out-  of-pocket costs.    When a Blue Choice OPT PPO member needs medical care,  they  have  the  option  of  selecting  a  provider  from  any  Tier.     C H I C AG O   B E N E F I T S   O F F I C E   •   W W W.

The amount of money the PPO member pays  out-of-pocket  is  based  on  the  provider’s  network  Tier.    Each  Tier  has  different  levels  of  coverage:  the  lowest  deductible,   co-insurance and co-pays are in Tier 1.  In addition to the new three tier network, the 2017 Blue Choice  OPT  PPO  plan,  benefit  coverage  changes  include  a  $150   emergency  room  co-pay;  new  pre-certification  requirements,  and a network of Transplant and Bariatric Centers of Distinction.    If you are currently enrolled in the City’s Blue Cross PPO plan  today, you may already be using a Tier 1 provider since all of  the doctors and hospitals in Tier 1 are also in the Blue Cross  PPO  network.

This chart compares how much a PPO member pays out-of-pocket for shoulder surgery in each Tier.

HOW TO AVOID FINANCIAL PENALTIES IN THE PPO   Certain PPO healthcare services need to be pre-approved* by Telligen, an independent medical advisor.  There are  financial penalties if Telligen is not contacted in time for pre-approval, also known as pre-certification.    Although the PPO member has to pay the penalty if care is not pre-approved, it is usually the healthcare provider who  calls Telligen to start the process.  PPO members should call Telligen at 1-800-373-3727 to make sure the pre-approval  call has been made, especially when more than one provider is involved in the care, such as:     THERAPY AND COUNSELLING  AMBULANCE TRANSFERS  Outpatient  mental  health  and  substance  abuse  therapy  and  counselling  needs  to  be  pre-approved  after  the  7th  session each year, even when sessions are combined from  one or more providers.  For example, if a PPO member  has four individual counseling visits with a psychologist and  three  group  therapy  sessions  with  a  social  worker,  these  will count as a total of seven sessions. The eighth session  and any future counselling and/or therapy needs to be pre- approved by Telligen or the member will have to pay the  full cost.      If the sessions continue from one year into the next, pre- approval needs to be requested again in the new year after   seven sessions.    All inpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment  must be pre-approved before the patient is admitted or a  $1,000 penalty applies.  When  a  private  ambulance  is  used  to  transfer  a  PPO  member  between  hospitals,  Telligen’s  pre-approval  is  required even if the hospital orders the transfer.  Telligen  needs to be contacted before the ambulance is arranged.   The  PPO  member  will  be  responsible  for  the  cost  of  the  transfer if approval is not provided by Telligen before the  transfer takes place.  DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING     MRIs,  PET  and  CT  scans  need  pre-approval  or  the  PPO  member  pays  the  full  cost.    Pre-approved  scans  are  covered  at  100%  if  done  at  a  free  standing  facility.  PPO  members  should  call  Telligen  before  the  scan  is  done  to  find the location of free standing facilities.  Deductibles and  co-insurance amounts apply when a pre-approved scan is  done at a hospital or billed by a hospital, or if it is an MRA  scan to get pictures of blood vessels inside the body.    *For a complete list of all PPO services that need to be pre-approved, refer to the pre-certification list in your   2107 open enrollment or new hire guide, or visit www.cityofchicago.org/benefits.

Regular preventive dental checkups with professional  cleaning help prevent gum disease by removing plaque.  Even though brushing and flossing helps control plaque, it still builds up and forms tartar which needs to be removed with  professional teeth cleaning.  Gums become infected if plaque and tarter are not removed.  This can lead to gum disease  and loss of bone holding the teeth.  Warning signs of gum disease include a bad taste in the mouth, chronic bad breath and  bleeding gums when brushing or flossing your teeth.    The City’s Dental PPO and Dental HMO plans both cover two preventive visits each year which include professional cleanings,  oral exam and x-rays for a $10 co-pay (in-network).  For more information about dental benefits and to find an in-network  dentist, visit www.bcbsil.com/cityofchicago or call 1-855-557-5487.  Dental insurance is provided to all employees and dependents enrolled in the City’s healthcare plan.  The dental plans are  available to new hires after one calendar year of full-time employment.  Those without dental coverage can save on the cost of  preventive dental visits and other dental care by enrolling in the Flexible Spending Account (FSA) and using pre-tax dollars for  dental check-ups.  Enroll in the FSA when hired or during open enrollment.    GETTING DIVORCED?  An ex-spouse cannot be covered as a dependent in the City’s health plan.  This is true even if the divorce decree states the City  employee needs to provide health insurance for the ex-spouse.  Employees need to drop the ex-spouse as a dependent and  submit a certified copy of the divorce decree:  • Call the City Benefits Service Center at 1-877-299-5111 to cancel an ex-spouse’s healthcare coverage within 30 days of the       date of divorce. • Take a certified copy of the entire divorce decree to the Chicago Benefits Office within 60 days of the date of divorce.  A copy       will be made of the last page and the decree will be given back to you.  Employees who do not comply with this procedure will have to pay any healthcare costs the City incurs for the ex-spouse.   In addition, failure to notify the City of the divorce may be treated as fraud.    The Chicago Benefit Office is located on the 4th floor, 333 South State Street; open Monday thru Friday, 8:30 a.m. until  4:30 p.m.  Employees getting divorced may want to change their life insurance beneficiary.  Call Prudential at 1-800-778-3827 to find out  how to update your beneficiary.    C H I C AG O   B E N E F I T S   O F F I C E   •   W W W. C I T YO F C H I C AG O B E N E F I T S .

9799`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/ParkingMeter/CityResponsetoATAReport.pdf`Success`Success`4`4`Not a fillable PDF.`   CITY OF CHICAGO RESPONSE TO ATA REPORT      Active Transportation Alliance (ATA), formerly the Chicagoland Bicycle Federation,  released a report today concerning the lease of the City’s parking meters.  While the  report does an admirable job of summarizing parking goals originated and championed  by economists like Donald Shoup – many of which the city supports – it fails in its  discussion of the meter concession.  The report shows a fundamental lack of  understanding of the basic terms of the concession agreement and their impact upon the  City of Chicago.    Transaction Provides Optimal System Utilization  As ATA notes, the objective of market-based pricing is to bring pricing to a level that will  provide optimal utilization of the system.  The meter rate increase implemented in early  2009 were intended to do just that, specifically reducing cruising for underpriced parking  and promoting turnover and availability.  This makes locations served by meters more  popular.  Before that, meter rates had not been increased at nearly 75% of the parking    meters in more than two decades.    Parking Meter Concession Will Help Maintain and Improve City Neighborhoods  The ATA argues that revenues generated from parking meters should be earmarked for  “filling potholes, repairing sidewalks, planting trees, replacing streetlights, and funding  more efficient transportation options.”  First – net revenue from the parking meter system  historically did not fund these specific items, but rather was part of the general corporate  fund revenue stream.    But the proceeds from this transaction – as well as other long-term leases – have very  much allowed the City to continue to invest in neighborhood improvements and quality of  life.    In fact, in 2005, after the City closed the Skyway transaction and set aside $500 million  in a long-term reserve, the City earned rating upgrades from all three rating agencies.      A strong credit rating has an substantial impact on the City’s cost to issue debt – higher  credit ratings mean lower borrowing costs, which is critical to funding transportation  infrastructure projects that improve Chicago’s neighborhoods and transportation system    And it is misleading for the ATA to assert that drivers will not see benefits from the  concession deal – the benefits of greater parking availability, less congestion, as well as  the benefits that the city’s corporate fund provides – including clean and safe streets and  traffic control – are all being furthered by this transaction.      The City also must balance a need for a variety of other city services that are not only  limited to transportation or sidewalk landscaping.  That includes those basic city services  – police, fire, emergency dispatch, and sanitation – that are paid for by the city’s  corporate fund and ensure all Chicago residents can live in safe, clean, and viable  communities.    With the transaction proceeds, we are including funding for the city’s corporate fund to  continue providing those services, as well as programs that help Chicago residents most      in need, including meals on wheels for seniors, after-school programs for children, and  affordable housing programs.    It is the City’s goal to include funding these needs both in the long and short term, and  funds from the concession agreement will allow the City to accomplish this.      City Maintains Control Over Public Way  Further, the City of Chicago always retains control of its public way.  The claim that the  City has lost control of “one of their most powerful urban planning and revenue- generating tools” is absolutely incorrect.        Chicago has a 15 plus-year track record of improving the bike, pedestrian and transit  environment (i.e. non-motorized) including one of the country’s largest on-street bike  networks and myriad safety education and outreach programs. Those programs are    continuing across the City, and will continue for years to come, in part, because of the  money received from the concession agreement.    To suggest that the parking meter concession “restrictions will severely limit innovative  planning for bicyclists, pedestrians and transit users” is wholly wrong.  To the contrary,  the City continues to pursue a wide range of planning efforts and construction projects,  part of an ongoing effort to offer attractive non-driving options.    Substantial Operating Efficiencies and Customer Service Improvement to Be  Realized  The ATA is also critical of the concession, claiming that there are “no appreciable  operating efficiencies to be gained.”  At the same time, the ATA also notes that the    concessionaire “is required to pay for all capital improvements to the system, including     the transition from typical meters to pay and display boxes that accept credit cards.”    Pay and displays are costly.  In the first year alone, the capital expenses for this  technology will cost the concessionaire between $40 and $50 million to install 3,000 pay  and display boxes, while the City only installed 190 over the last five years.   $40 million  to $50 million is more than two times the meter revenue in 2008, and it is an expense the  concessionaire will own several times over during the life of the agreement.      This is the very technology necessary to measure utilization and accomplish the ATA’s  goals of congestion and peak period pricing, as well as its goal of un-cluttering city  streets and sidewalks.       The City Sheds Risk of Reduced Auto Parking   The ATA’s report also neglects the notion of risk.  The ATA would like to see a reduction  in vehicle use and an increase in walking, biking, and public transportation.  Increased  use of other modes of transit – which ATA supports – will surely negatively impact meter  utilization.  And that is a significant risk to revenue that the City no longer owns.        In fact, over the 75-year period of the concession there are a number of significant risks  that the City no longer bares, including those utilization risks associated with changes in  population, economic activity, and technology.  For instance, there were no combustible  engines 75 years ago, and 50 years ago there were no parking meters.  To assume  there are no technological advances that will change the use of on-street parking meters  would be naïve.                 City Uses Proceeds for the Long-term and Today    The $1.156 billion received by the City is not an “upfront payment that solves short term  financial problems without considering the long term implications.”  A significant portion  of the payment the City received is being invested for future use.  In fact, the City  invested more than $400 million in a long-term reserve that will replace the net revenue  provided by the meter system and increase the City’s long-term reserves to $900 million.      The City also invested $325 million in a mid-term budget relief fund that will help us  balance budgets through 2012, and $320 million in a budget stabilization fund that may  be used to help bridge the period until the nation’s economy recovers, allowing the City  to continue vital services and avoid steep tax increases.  Finally, the City is investing  $100 million in human infrastructure programs like the low income housing trust fund,  and ex-offender and other job and social programs.  Finally, $150 million was used to  help balance the 2008 and 2009 budgets, avoiding major layoffs or tax increases.      City Maintains Control Over Parking Rates and Meter Placement  And finally, the ATA’s claim that the City has lost control over the parking meters  specifically is purely fiction.  The setting of meter rates is a reserve power of the City.  It  cannot be assigned to the concessionaire.  Changes to the rate structure and hours of    operation can be implemented, but the City must be cognizant of the implications those  changes may have on revenues.  The City has historically always owned the risk of a    revenue impact when changes to the meter system are made.  It continues to own the  risk today.    There are opportunities, however, to reduce the economic risk.  The City can increase  rates, hours of operation, or even the number of meters to mitigate the impact.  A cost    benefit analysis is always necessary to determine if changes to on-street parking are  advisable.  These benefits are not always economic, but could have to do with promoting  the free flow of traffic or providing deterrence to parking in heavily congested area.      In conclusion, the “Implications” detailed in the report are all erroneous.  Those mistakes  are detailed below:     1.  “The overarching impact is that the City has essentially given up control over         pricing of the meters and placement of the meters.”   FALSE.  As noted above, the City has retained full control over the public way  and the parking meter system, including pricing and placement of meters, and  the ability to implement market-rate parking policies.     2.  “This agreement makes it impossible for the City to test any new hourly meter   rates for price elasticity of demand...”                  FALSE.  The City has retained full control over rate setting.  Further, the  transaction has actually enabled the City to test new hourly meter rates because  the new meter technology provides real time utilization information.  The old  meters made it impossible to accurately measure price elasticity.   3.  “The cost for temporary removal of a parking meter is based on ‘the maximum         utilization or a comparable meter…’”      FALSE.  When a meter is temporarily removed, the City only pays the amount of  lost revenue as measured by actual revenue in the previous year for the period of  time during which the meter is out of service.  It is not based on the revenue  generated by the highest producing meter.   4.  “So while the city technically retains control over these spaces, any move to      remove or adjust parking will financially penalize the City.”   FALSE.  As stated above, the financial impact of changes now are largely the  same as those prior to the concession.  Before the City entered into the  transaction, if it removed meters, it lost revenue.     5.  “This means that every potential project on a street with meter, including…. …are       dictated, controlled and limited by parking meters.”   FALSE.  The degree to which meters impact projects has not changed.  The  financial impact on City revenues from potential projects has not changed.     6. 	 “…the cost of removing parking or placing rush hour parking controls over the   length of a potential route such as Western Avenue would be staggering.”    FALSE.  Again, the cost of any such controls is no different under the  transaction.  The costs, if staggering, would have been equally as staggering  prior to the transaction.     7.  “The prices increase, but drivers will not see the benefits in increases sidewalk   cleaning, pothole mending, or tree planting.”               FALSE.  Prior to the transaction, all net meter revenue went to the general fund,  not the specific areas that contained parking meters.  Further, the transaction has  ensured that the City has the funds necessary to continue providing vital  municipal services, which it would have to have reduced otherwise.     ###   
9800`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/ParkingMeter/IPOSLawSuit.pdf`Success`Success`2`2`Not a fillable PDF.`   August 21, 2009    This week, the political organization known as the Independent  Voters of Illinois – Independent Precinct Organization (IVI-IPO) filed a  lawsuit against the City of Chicago to challenge the City’s parking  meter concession agreement.      The lawsuit is wholly without merit, both factually and legally, and the  City will vigorously defend against it. In their press conference and  legal filings, the organization made a number of misstatements of  fact, and their allegations have been both erroneous and  irresponsible.    First, the City did not delegate the ability to set rates for parking  meters, as the organization and its counsel assert.  The parking  meter concession agreement and the City’s Municipal Code are  clear: the setting of meter rates is a reserve power of the City.  That  power cannot be assigned to the concessionaire, Chicago Parking  Meters, LLC (CPM).  Changes to the rate structure and hours of  operation can be implemented, but only through action by the City.   CPM is obligated to abide by these decisions. CPM’s activities are  limited to the operation, management, rehabilitation, and collection of  the parking meter system.    Second, the concession agreement is an agreement to operate the  meter system over 75 years.  It is neither a sale nor a lease, as the  organization wrongly suggests.  The public way was not sold nor  leased to CPM. CPM has no ownership interest or lease right to the  roads or sidewalks.  While ownership of the equipment was  transferred, the City will own any and all improvements made to the  system by CPM upon expiration or termination of the agreement.       Third, the IVI-IPO’s claim that the City should not enforce parking  meter violations or assist with the maintenance of parking meters has  no foundation.  The City maintains a responsibility for traffic  management, and remains fully engaged in ensuring parking meters  and their enforcement are utilized as tools to carry out this    responsibility in the public interest.     By limiting the time a vehicle may park in a particular space, parking meters create  turnover and increase availability.  When there are available spaces to park, there is  less cruising for parking.  Cruising leads to increased congestion and pollution.  The  maintenance and enforcement of parking meters plays a vital role in reducing  congestion and travel times, promoting local businesses, and cutting pollution.      Fourth, the City bears the financial costs of meter removals today, just as it did before  the parking meter concession was approved.  Historically, the City has always had the  risk of negative revenue impacts when meters were removed.  The City continues to  bear that risk.      CPM, on the other hand, bears the risks associated with reductions in vehicle use and  increases in walking, biking, and the use of public transportation.  Reductions in parking  meter utilization and the resulting revenue are CPM’s burdens, not the City’s.  The IVI- IPO’s assertions to the contrary are wrong.    Lastly, the City has not delegated its police powers, as the organization incorrectly  asserts. Revenue from parking violations is retained solely by the City of Chicago.   Although CPM could assist the City with enforcing meter violations, subject to strict  operational standards, all of the revenue derived from parking meter enforcement  belongs to the City.

Sincerely,        Gene Saffold  Chief Financial Officer  City of Chicago           
9801`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/ParkingMeter/MeterFAQs.pdf`Success`Success`8`8`Not a fillable PDF.`"Why does the City have parking meters?  By limiting the time that a vehicle may park in a particular space, meters play a vital role  in facilitating traffic management, promoting business, and reducing congestion and  pollution.      Do all meters operate 24 hours per day?  No.  Meters are free during evenings in most places except for City parking lots and the  Loop.  Days and hours of operation should be posted on the meters.      When do I have to pay the parking meter?  Please look at the time and days of operation on the meters.  Generally meters operate  from: 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on residential streets; 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. on business streets, and 24  hours in the Loop and City parking lots.  There are, however, exceptions.  Days and  hours of operation should be posted on the meters.    Are there parking meter holidays?    Unless otherwise posted, there are no meter holidays.    Can I park at a broken parking meter?  Yes, you may park at the broken meter for free if you report it as broken within 24 hours  by calling 877.242.7901.    How do I report a broken parking meter?  Please call the 24 hour customer service line at 877.242.7901 and provide information  about the meter, including the meter ID number.  You will be provided with a  confirmation number.      How do I request a refund?  If you have had a payment issue with a parking meter and would like to request a refund,  please call 877.242.7901.  Please note that all refund requests must be made within 30  days of the original transaction date.    Where is the meter ID number?  The number is located on the meter head on a single-space meter.  On the pay and  display boxes, the meter ID number is located on the front panel.    What happens once I report a meter as broken?  All reports of broken meters are investigated promptly, most within a few hours.    Can meters be impacted when there are drastic changes in temperature including  freezing conditions?  Yes.  Similar to most on-street equipment, parking meters may experience problems  when there are drastic changes in temperature including freezing conditions.  The City of  Chicago and the parking meter concessionaire—Chicago Parking Meters, LLC— recognize that any broken meter can be an inconvenience to motorists.  The  concessionaire is committed to ensuring that each motorist has a pleasant parking  experience.  During near sub-zero temperatures, the concessionaire will maintain and  de-ice parking meters.  Problems reported to their customer service personnel are  largely addressed within an hour or two.            1  Will I get a ticket when a pay box is broken because of the cold?  Although parking enforcement personnel work during freezing conditions, they have  been instructed to verify whether a parking meter is operational before issuing any  parking meter violation. If a parking enforcement aide determines that there is a problem  at a meter, he or she is instructed to report it to the concessionaire.  Motorists parking at  a broken meter should report it by contacting the 24 x 7 customer service line at  877.242.7901.        Will I get a ticket when my windshield is covered by snow or ice?  Motorists are obligated to pay to park at a metered space regardless of the weather  conditions.  When parking at a pay box, a motorist should display his or her receipt on  the curb side of the dashboard regardless of the presence of snow or ice.      Drivers generally clear snow off their windshields prior to driving, parking, and displaying  a pay box receipt.  And parking enforcement personnel will gently brush away snow to  determine if a pay box receipt is displayed.  This protocol is not different from years past  when the City operated pay boxes in the Loop and some neighborhoods.  This protocol  is similar to how personnel have historically enforced city sticker, disabled placard,  residential permit, and expired plate violations.  Personnel may also need to brush snow  from a single space meter to determine if it is active or from a vehicle’s license plate to  capture the plate number.        Parking enforcement personnel are instructed to use discretion.  In the rare occasion  when a vehicle is covered by an excessive amount of snow or ice, it may be difficult to  determine if a pay box receipt is displayed.   In cases where a pay box receipt may be  obscured by excessive snow or ice, personnel will forego issuing a ticket.  In the  unfortunate event that a motorist receives a ticket in error, the pay and display receipt  can be used as evidence to challenge the ticket.     What happens if I get a meter violation (section 9-64-190 of the Chicago Municipal  Code) at a broken parking meter?  It is important to report any parking meter problem that you identify.  After reporting the  meter as broken, please request an in-person hearing or contest the violation by mail.   Hearing officers have access to all reports of broken meters and can access that  information when reviewing your case.    Why did I get a ticket if the meter is broken?  Enforcement personnel are trained to recognize inoperable meters.  Unfortunately, a  meter may not always be visibly broken.  If you are issued a meter violation and you feel  it was issued in error, please report it by contacting the 24 x 7 customer service line at  877.242.7901.  You will be provided a reference number.  Then contest the violation by  following the directions on the back of the ticket.  Use your reference number during your  hearing or in your correspondence.  Information about your call and the meter history will  be available to a hearing officer during the hearing.    The red light is flashing on the single space meter. What does that mean?   The red light means that time has expired and the meter requires payment.    What types of coins do the old-style meters take?   Quarters and sometimes dollar coins.        2  What types of coins do the “pay and display” boxes take?    Generally quarters and dollars, but the pay and display boxes take credit and debit cards  as well.  They also accept the East Lakeview Chamber of Commerce gift card.     What are some other benefits of pay boxes?  Pay and displays reduce clutter on sidewalks and make neighborhoods more attractive.    These smart boxes notify operators wirelessly when they require collection or are  broken.  Consequently, collection and maintenance crews need to visit meters less  often.  Travel reductions shrink the carbon footprint of collectors and mechanics and  reduce congestion.      How else are the pay boxes “green”?  These environmentally-friendly devices are solar-powered, eliminating the need to  dispose of 45,000 lithium and 9 volt batteries each year.  In addition, the pay and display  receipts are biodegradable.    If I still have time on my pay box receipt, can I use it to park at another pay box?    Yes, a great benefit of pay and displays is that they allow motorists to take unused time  with them.  For example, if a motorist parks in a neighborhood parking spot ($1.25 per  hour), he or she may use the pay and display receipt to park in another $1.25 per hour  space at a pay and display anywhere in the city as long as the receipt has not expired.   He or she cannot, however, use the $1.25 per hour receipt to park in a more expensive  area ($2.50 or $4.25 per hour).     Will a pay box allow me to prepay for time?  That depends.  Many pay and display boxes allow motorists to prepay from 8 a.m. to 10  a.m. (or later), with the earliest time being 5 a.m.  If, however, the pay and display is  located in a morning rush hour parking zone, it may not allow motorists to pre-pay for  time.      Do pay boxes protect against identity theft?  Yes, they are compliant with Payment Card Industry Security Standards.  This set of  requirements ensure that companies that process, store, or transmit credit card  information maintain a secure environment.     How do I use a pay box?  For detailed instructions, please visit cityofchicago.org/revenue and select the “About  Parking Meters” link.  Once there, select the link labeled “Pay and Display Instruction  Sheet.”  There are Spanish and Polish translations online as well.    How do I display a pay box receipt on my motorcycle or scooter?  Since motorcycles and scooters lack a dashboard, the City of Chicago ordinance  requires that the pay box receipt be displayed on the front head lamp by using the  adhesive on the back of the receipt.  A motorcycle or scooter owner should write the  license plate number on the receipt to discourage theft.  A receipt is only valid if  displayed on the motorcycle or scooter bearing that license plate number.     CPM worked closely with ABATE, the largest motorcycle lobbyist in Illinois, and  redesigned the receipt that is now being provided.  It reached out to the scooter lobby for  feedback as well in redesigning the receipt.          3  How does the pay box keep time?  In September 2009, the concessionaire successfully implemented a program that adds  up to 1 minute, 59 seconds to each initial pay-and-display purchase.  The program was  implemented to mitigate any minor time variations between the pay boxes and other  digital clocks, such as watches or those on cell phones.  Studies show that cell phones  may not properly synchronize and may keep the wrong time.  However, pay boxes are  scheduled to synchronize every night wirelessly with a central server clock – which is  synched with atomic time to ensure accuracy.      How many pay boxes will be installed?  Under the terms of an agreement with the City, the parking meter operator (Chicago  Parking Meters, LLC) must offer cashless alternatives at all meters by 2011.  The  operator, however, already replaced more than 32,000 parking meters with more than  4,100 pay boxes.  The operator assumed all of the costs of this rollout, estimated to be  between $40 and $50 million.  They will replace the pay boxes whenever necessary, but  likely at least every seven years.      How do I avoid a ticket while making a payment at a pay box?  Parking enforcement aides are instructed to look for motorists before issuing a parking  meter violation.  They are asked to determine if a motorist might be at or walking to or  from a pay box.   Unlike the old single space meters, parking enforcement aides know  when the pay box receipt has expired.  They give motorists a grace period before issuing  any violation.  In the unfortunate event that a ticket is issued in error, motorists should  contest the violation and provide a copy of the pay box receipt.    How many parking spaces can be served by a single pay box on the public way?    A maximum of 15 spaces can be served by one box.  Pay and display boxes generally  increase the number of cars that can park on a block.    Where on a block are the pay boxes placed?  On short block faces, the operator attempts to put the pay and display in the middle of  the block.  On longer blocks where two pay and displays might be installed, the goal is to  break the block up into thirds.     Are there other criteria used to determine where pay boxes should be situated?  Yes, there are a number of other factors that may impact the position of a pay and  display box.  For instance, the operator avoids placing boxes in front of a business’  entrance or neighboring gangway.  The goal is to allow for easy ingress and egress from  the business and alley.  Also, the operator tries not to place pay and display boxes in  front of restaurants that might apply for an outdoor café license.  Although the boxes can  be fairly easily moved, the operator does not want to inconvenience a business.  There  are a few other considerations, including the placement of gas and electric lines, fire  hydrants, loading zones, and other restricted parking areas. In addition, the operator  tries to make decisions based on the types of businesses being served.      Can businesses request that a pay box be moved in order to assist elderly or  disabled motorists?  The City and the operator recognize the need for parking transactions to be convenient.   There have been requests from time to time to move a pay and display box because of  the nature of the business being served.  For instance, it might be more important for a  pay and display to be situated a little closer to a rehabilitation facility or a chiropractor      4  than to other types of businesses.  Persons with disabilities may still park for free at  parking meters and, consequently, are not required to display a pay and display receipt.    Can the City change the duration of time (also know as the “period of stay”) at the  meters in front of my business or institution?  Yes.  Most meters allow for a maximum of two hours.  Two hours, though, might not be  enough for theaters, concert halls, cinemas, gyms, or schools.  You can now make  requests to extend the period of stay online.   Please visit cityofchicago.org/revenue and  select the “About Parking Meters” link.  Then select the “Business Feedback Form” to  provide information to us about the needs of your business.       Why did parking meter rates increase?  Properly priced parking meters create better turnover and availability, making locations  served by meters more popular.  However, demand for on-street parking has grown at a  faster rate than supply.  Rates have not kept pace, and under-priced meters promote  cruising for parking spaces.  Cruising ultimately leads to increased congestion, travel  time, and pollution.  Under-priced meters also subsidize automobile use at the cost of  public transportation.    What are the rates in Chicago?  Generally, the rates in 2010 were 1.25 per hour in the residential neighborhoods, $2.50  per hour in the Central Business District, and $4.25 per hour in the Loop.  In the Loop  and parking lots, the rate was reduced 50% between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m.    In 2011, in most areas of the City, representing 82% of the metered parking spaces,  rates will be $1.50 per hour.    In the Central Business District outside the Loop (Area bounded by Lake Michigan to the  East, North Avenue to the North, Halsted to the West, and Roosevelt Road to the South,  exclusive of the Loop Area), representing approximately 16% of the metered parking  spaces, rates will be $3.00 per hour.    Inside the Loop (Area bounded by Lake Michigan to the East, Wacker Drive to the North  and West, and Congress Parkway to the South), representing less than 3% of the  metered parking spaces, rates will be $5.00 per hour from 8 AM- 9 PM, $2.50 from 9 PM  – 8 AM.     What are the boundaries of the Central Business District?  The central business district is the area bounded by:  South: the south side of Roosevelt Road;  East: Lake Michigan;  North: the north side of North Avenue;  West: the west side of Halsted Street (excluding the area within the boundaries of the  Loop).    What are the boundaries of the Loop?  The Loop is the area bounded by:   On the South: the south side of Congress Parkway;  On the East: Lake Michigan;  On the North: the north side of Wacker Drive;   And on the West: the west side of Wacker Drive.      5  What is the schedule for rate increases over the next three years?  Loop (per hour): 2011: $5.00; 2012: $5.75; 2013: $6.50;  Central Business District (per hour): 2011: $3.00; 2012: $3.50; 2013: $4.00; and  Neighborhoods (per hour): 2011: $1.50; 2012: $1.75; 2013: $2.00.    What are the scheduled rate increases after 2013?  Increases are generally scheduled to track with inflation.    If I buy 2 hours of parking at a 2 hour single space meter, can I add time to the  meter later prior to the meter expiring?   If someone adds additional coins, the single space meter will add time until it tops off at  the maximum limit, whether that is 2 hours or some other duration.     What is the parking meter concession?  The concessionaire (or “Chicago Parking Meters, LLC”) paid the City of Chicago $1.156  billion.  In addition, Chicago Parking Meters, LLC, is required to maintain, upgrade, and  repair parking meters for 75 years in return for the revenue from those meters.      How was the parking meter concessionaire selected?  The City sent a request for qualifications to more than 150 infrastructure investors and  parking investors in February 2008.  Ten prospective bidders sent in responses.  Six  were deemed qualified.  Ultimately, two companies bid, and the highest bidder, Chicago  Parking Meters, LLC, was chosen on December 1, 2008.  For a detailed discussion of  the selection process, please visit cityofchicago.org/revenue and select the “About  Parking Meters” link.  Once there, select the link “Selection Process and Timeline”.    Isn’t the concession just a long-term lease?  No, the agreement between the City of Chicago and Chicago Parking Meters, LLC (or  “CPM“) represents a concession to operate the parking meter system. The agreement  requires CPM to provide “metered parking services” which includes the operation,  management, maintenance, and rehabilitation of the system, and the collection of  parking meter revenue. No interest in real estate of any kind was conveyed in any form  (sale, lease, or other). The only title received by CPM was for the existing meter  inventory, and that inventory reverts back to the City’s possession upon the agreement’s  expiration or termination.    Why is the concession to operate meters for 75 years?  Why not a shorter period?    This is a requirement of investors.  Typically, debt issued to fund infrastructure projects  is 30-year debt.  Lenders require an additional 10-year ""tail"" in case revenues don't  come in high enough to pay the debt off during the original 30-year period.  Equity  investors are able to increase their returns by refinancing debt during the term of the  concession and thus require at least an additional 10 years.  That results in a minimum  term of 50 years.  In addition, the City received strong indications from the bidders that  they would increase the up-front payment to the City if given an additional 25 years.  And  the increase is greater than the time value of money of an additional 25 years worth of  revenue.      6  Did the City get a good deal?  Yes, the City received a very good deal.  Third party financial advisors used  sophisticated modeling software to determine the likely range of bids.  They predicted  bids between $650 million and $1.2 billion for the parking meter system.  The City’s  minimum acceptable bid was $1 billion, a figure calculated to compensate for the loss of  existing meter revenues and stabilize the budget.  The best and final bid was $1.156  billion from Chicago Parking Meters, LLC, an amount at the top end of the projections.   For a detailed discussion of the valuation, please visit cityofchicago.org/revenue and  select the “About Parking Meters” link.  Once there, select the links labeled “Value”  prepared by third party financial advisor William Blair.     Why do some reports suggest that the City could have received more?  Most underestimate risks and operational costs.  Chicago Parking Meters, LLC, owns  the risk of installing equipment, escalating labor costs, fuel costs, expanded use of public  transportation, and, most importantly, changes in driving behavior.  Those risks are  significant.  For a detailed discussion of the valuation, please visit  cityofchicago.org/revenue and select the “About Parking Meters” link.  Once there, select  the links labeled “Value” prepared by third party financial advisor William Blair.       What is the difference between “reserve” and “concession” meters?  There are two types of parking meters operated by the concessionaire: reserve parking  meters and concession parking meters.  The City retains the revenues (minus an  operating expense of 15%) for reserve parking meters, while the concessionaire  receives the revenues from concession parking meters.  The City has the power to  change the status of a meter from reserve to concession, and vice versa.     What is the true-up system?  Under the agreement, the City has agreed to an initial set of scheduled rate increases,  followed by annual adjustments to the system value equal to inflation. To the extent the  City implements changes that negatively impact the meter system value, the City may be  required to compensate the concessionaire (“true up”). Similarly, if the City takes action  that increases the value of the system more than is required, the City may capture that  value. Adjustments to meter system value can be in the form of increases in rates, hours  and the number of meters.    How is the dollar amount of any true-up determined?  Each meter is different.  Not only do meters operate at different rates and hours  throughout the City, but utilization also differs depending on the area and businesses  served.  Each meter equates to a fraction of the overall system based on its rate, hours  of operation, and utilization (note: this fraction is recalibrated annually based on changes  in utilization).  When a meter is closed--or added--the total system value may be  impacted.  Comparing the fractional value to the revenue for the entire system derives  the revenue value for a particular meter.  Negative impacts are credits due to the  concessionaire.  Positive impacts are credited to the City.  Small changes are less likely  to carry a significant economic impact, especially when utilization is factored into the  analysis already.  Further, financial impacts may be mitigated by other changes to the  meter system.         Did the City bear the same financial risk before the meter concession?  Yes.  The City owns the economic impact today just as it did prior to the concession  when the removal of a parking meter reduced the City’s revenue.  Today, if the meter is      7  a reserve meter, there is still economic impact to the City’s revenue.  If the meter is a  concession meter, the closure of a meter may necessitate a payment to the  concessionaire…or it may not.    What is the process for a developer who needs to temporarily remove parking  meters?  Temporary removals usually result from commercial development projects.  The  municipal code requires developers to apply for a permit and compensate the City for  any associated loss in meter revenue.  This provision of the code predates the parking  meter concession agreement.  Money from the developers is then deposited into a  compensation fund.  That compensation fund is used to offset reductions in City revenue  (for reserve meters) or, when necessary, to compensate the concessionaire (for  concession meters).    What is the formal process for a business or developer who proposes  permanently altering the public way in a manner that would require the removal of  parking meters?  Permanent meter removals have and continue to require aldermanic approval and  passage by the City Council.  The City Council retains the authority under the  concession agreement to add and remove meters, to set rates, durations, hours and  days of operation.  When an alderman introduces an ordinance concerning parking  meters, the City reviews the potential social-economic impacts.  Initial considerations for  removing a meter include the impact on congestion, pollution, traffic control,  development, and safety.  The City also considers the economic impact.   For permanent  closures, the City may seek to offset revenue losses through the exercise of reserved  powers like adding meters.  Alternatively, the City may increase the hours or days of  operation or adjust the rates.    Does the business or developer have to pay costs for permanent removals?  There are really no costs assumed by a developer or business if the meter removal is  approved by the City Council.  As stated above, the City would have owned similar  economic risks even if the concession agreement had not been negotiated.  To date,  however, aldermen and city officials have worked closely together in an effort to avoid  negative economic impacts.  For instance, on one occasion an ordinance was  introduced to remove meters to increase sidewalk width in order to have sidewalk cafes  installed.  Passage of the ordinance would have reduced the system in service.   However, the ordinance was amended to allow for the addition of a handful of parking  meters, thereby ensuring that there was no negative impact to the City or the  businesses.      8  "
9802`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/ParkingMeter/PayandDisplayBenefits.pdf`Success`Success`1`1`Not a fillable PDF.`  Pay and Displays  Chicago Parking Meters, LLC, or “CPM” is adding pay and displays to the streets of  Chicago at an unprecedented rate of about 30 per day.  In a 5 year period, the City of  Chicago installed just 198 pay and displays.  As of July 7, 2009, more than 1357 new  pay boxes have been added by CPM replacing 10,236 meters.  In addition, the 198 older  generation pay and displays were replaced by 207 newer models.      CPM is committed to replacing approximately 30,000 meters this year, about two years  ahead of schedule for two-thirds of those spaces, at an expense of between $40 and  $50 million.  Additional expenditures will be required, especially and pay and displays  are replaced every 7 to 10 years.        The benefits of pay and displays are significant:     •	  Motorists may pay by credit and debit card or use a  quarter or dollar coin;              •	  They beautify commercial areas by reducing clutter;            •	  They use solar power, reducing the need to recycle more than 40,000 9-volt               and lithium batteries per year;   •	  Wireless connectivity immediately informs mechanics when the box is broken            or in need of collection.  Consequently, collection and maintenance crews need    to visit meters less often.  Travel reductions shrink the carbon footprint of    collectors and mechanics and reduce congestion.;     •	  Motorists can “pre-pay” for time when there are no posted restrictions;              •	  Motorists will not be charged for time beyond the meters hours of operation;              •	  They can be programmed for variable periods of stay and rates;              •	  Utilization can be measured by hour at each and every block;              •	  They provide a receipt for business and tax purposes.

Although these observers, in many cases, make  an  earnest  attempt  to  analyze  the  value  of  the  System,  we  believe  that  many  of  their  assertions,  assumptions  and  conclusions  are  not  correct.    In  the  following  analysis,  we  illustrate the impact of these misconceptions, using as a basis of comparison information  presented  in  the  Report.    As  discussed  below,  the  two  most  significant  inaccuracies  contained in the Report are (i) its use of gross System revenue rather than free net cash  flow in estimating System value and (ii) its use of an inappropriately low discount rate in  estimating the value of the System to the City.  Our analysis confirms that by properly  projecting System revenues and by applying a discount rate that appropriately reflects the  relative risks of the System, the conclusion that the City received full and fair value for  the Concession of the System is clearly supported and affirmed.     The  City  of  Chicago  (the  “City”)  has  been  a  leader  among  American  state  and  local  governments  in  successfully  partnering  with  the  private  sector  by  pursuing  and  completing innovative long-term concessions of the Chicago Skyway, the underground  parking  garages  located  in  Grant  and  Millennium  Parks,  and  the  Chicago  Metered  Parking  System.    In  total,  those  transactions  have  provided  nearly  $3.6  billion  for  Chicago  residents  and  taxpayers.      Many  other  American  cities  now  hope  to  copy  Chicago’s success, particularly in the area of parking.    The  City  has  applied  the  nearly  $3.6  billion  of  proceeds  from  these  transactions  to:  establish long-term reserve funds of more than $1 billion, including $900 million for the  City and $120 million for the Chicago Park District, to replace revenue generated by the  Skyway, parking garages and parking meters; retire $925 million in debt; reserve more  than $700 million for mid-term budget relief in order to maintain essential City services;  and  invest  more  than  $322  million  in  neighborhoods,  parks  and  programs  that  serve  people most in need.    Each  of  the  three  successful  transactions  eliminated  long-term  risks  of  increased  operating  and  capital  expenditures,  while  mitigating  the  risk  of  future  changes  in  technology and in the behavior of the users of the assets.    After the $1.83 billion Chicago Skyway concession transaction closed, and the long-term  reserve was established, all three bond rating agencies upgraded the City's credit rating.   Today, the City enjoys its highest credit ratings since 1978.     The $563 million concession of the downtown parking garage system helped to pay off  all of the debt used to build Chicago's world-class Millennium Park, and allowed for a  shift  of  capital  resources  from  downtown  parking  garages  to  neighborhood  parks  throughout the city by investing $122 million in neighborhood park infrastructure.     The City’s announced policy is to pursue long-term public-private partnerships involving  infrastru    cture assets only when:      2  •  There is substantial potential financial benefit to the Chicago tax payers   and residents;   •  The  assets  involved  do  not  involve  the  core  competencies  of  City   government; and    •  Experienced  and  professional  operators  are  able  to  improve  efficiency,   quality of service and make enhanced capital investments in the assets.     City  policy  and  concession  agreements  further  require  that  private  operators  treat  employees  fairly,  provide  a  high  level  of  safety  and  security,  and  satisfy  strong  performance, operating and engineering standards.  Throughout each transaction, the City  has provided great transparency in the robust competitive bidding process and through  the plan      ning of the use of concession proceeds.    How the City Estimated the Value of the System  and Determined the Minimum Acceptable Bid     The City and Blair worked together over a period of months to estimate the value of the  System to infrastructure investors, estimate the potential value of the System to the City  and  identify  the  minimum  bid  amount  that  the  City  would  accept  for  a  75-year  Concession.  Before  proceeding  with  the  transaction,  the  City  wanted  reasonable  assurance, using widely-accepted financial valuation methods applicable to infrastructure  assets,  and  incorporating  various  assumptions  concerning  rates,  utilization,  risk  allocation, discount rate and other factors affecting valuation, that a long-term concession  of the System would produce an upfront payment that would be both sufficient to replace  the revenues currently produced by the System and to produce a substantial premium that  would f   Infrastructure Investor Valuation Approach  Blair  used  a  multi-variable  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  to  estimate  the  value  of  the  System to infrastructure investors.  The value of the metered parking system is primarily  a function of two factors:     airly compensate the City for a 75-year concession.        •  The  long-term  free  cash  flow  of  the  System  ---  estimated  operating  revenue  (which  makes  assumptions  about  driver  utilization),  minus  operating  expenses,  minus  capital  expenditures  and  corporate  tax  liabilities; and   •  The  bidder’s  cost  and  mix  of  debt  and  equity  financing  or  cost  of   capital.   In  estimating  the  value  of  the  proposed  long-term  concession  of  the  System,  Blair  prepared and continued to refine its multi-variable analysis using a variety of assumptions  for the factors that impact long-term free cash flow and the bidder’s cost of capital.  Blair  began  by  identifying  all  the  factors  that  impact  either  long-term  free  cash  flow  or  the      3  bidder’s cost of capital.  Next, Blair constructed a range of potential values for each of  those factors and assigned each potential value with a probability of occurrence.  As such,  the probabilities for all the potential values of a factor add up to 100%.  A scenario was  calculated for every possible combination of those factors, which produced thousands of  outcomes,  each  with  a  very  small  probability  of  occurrence  based  on  the  individual  probabilities of the factors.  The analysis produced a standard distribution of outcomes,  similar to a “bell curve” of grades in a college class.  Based on this bell curve, Blair was  able to predict a range of values based on confidence intervals.       Using the valuation method described above, Blair initially established a valuation range  for  the  Concession  of  between  $650  million  and  $1.2  billion.    While  this  range  was  refined  during the bidding process, the top end of the range never exceeded $1.2 billion.       City Held System Valuation Approach     The estimated value of the System in the City’s hands is much more hypothetical.  As  such, there are several ways to approach the value of the System had the City not entered  into the Concession.    Approach 1 – Current Practices    In 2005, the City increased the rate on meters located in the Loop from $1.50 to $3.00 per  hour.  This marked the first time in many years that the City increased meter rates on  such  a  widespread  basis.    This  increase  affected  approximately  1,000  spaces  and  represented  only  3%  of  the  System.    More  importantly,  the  $0.25  hourly  rate  for  approximately 75% of the System had not been increased in over 20 years.  Exhibit 1  (attached) estimates the value of the System assuming continued operation by the City  and annual rate increases of 3.0%.  This assumption is probably aggressive given the fact  that the rates on 75% City meters had not increased in over 20 years.  During that 20-year  period, the rate of inflation average approximately 3.2% per year.     Using  this  valuation  method  and  a  discount  rate  ranging  from  10.00%  to  14.00%,  the  estimated  value  of  the  System  would  be  between  $177  million  and  $276  million  (see  Exhibit 1).      Approach 2 – Concession Practices    The  City  faced  two  significant  challenges  to  increasing  parking  meter  rates.    First,  as  discussed above, the rates on most meters in the System had not been increased in many  years  and  there  was  a  general  lack  of  uniformity  as  to  rates  and  hours  of  operation.   Second, there was also the challenge of acquiring the expensive “pay and display” meter  technology that would be needed to support higher meter rates.  The estimated total cost  (equipment and labor) for upgrading the City’s meter technology is approximately $50  million.    Given  the  other  higher  priority  demands  on  the  City’s  limited  capital  improvement funds, it seemed unlikely that adequate funding would be available from      4  City  capital  dollars  to  pay  for  the  prompt  acquisition  and  installation  of  new  meter  technology.      This valuation approach ignores these two challenges and the risks associated with each  and assumes that the City increased rates in the same manner as under the Concession  transaction.  Although many factors impact the value of the System to the City, the two  that have the largest impact are the reaction of parkers to rate increases during the initial  five years of rate increases and the City’s discount rate.    Starting  in  year  six  of  the  pricing  structure,  rates  increase  to  keep  pace  with  inflation.   Because beginning in year six rates do not increase on a real basis, there is no reason to  expect that utilization will be impacted solely by parking meter rates.  However, during  the first five years rates do increase substantially, in some cases going from $0.25 per  hour to $2.00 per hour.  The impact on utilization due to price increases is the elasticity  of  demand,  defined  as  the  percentage  impact  on  demand  when  price  changes  by  1%.   Obviously,  as  discussed  below,  utilization  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  a  variety  of  other factors, and the City has shifted all of these utilization risks to the concessionaire.    The Inspector General’s Report analyzes five separate revenue scenarios, which are each  produced by differing assumptions regarding the elasticity of demand for street parking.   The analysis that Blair prepared for the City analyzed the impact that all relevant factors  had on value, not just demand elasticity.  However, given that this is the only factor that  the Report used and to keep things simple, Exhibit 2 (attached) uses those scenarios and  produces a value for each:     (cid:131)  Scenario 1 - Year five revenue is $85 million – The estimated value of the  System is $515 million to $850 million, assuming a discount rate of 10.0%  to  14.0%  (see  discussion  below  concerning  the  calculation  of  discount  rates).     (cid:131)  Scenario 2 - Year five revenue is $100 million – The estimated value of  the System is $625 million to $1.024 billion, assuming a discount rate of  10.0% to 14.0%.                  (cid:131)  Scenario 3 - Year five revenue is $107.5 million – The estimated value of  the System is $678 million to $1.111 billion, assuming a discount rate of  10.0% to 14.0%.   (cid:131)  Scenario 4 - Year five revenue is $115 million – The estimated value of  the System is $732 million to $1.198 billion, assuming a discount rate of  10.0% to 14.0%.   (cid:131)  Scenario 5 - Year five revenue is $130 million – The estimated value of  the System is $839 million to $1.372 billion, assuming a discount rate of  10.0% to 14.0%.   5  Assuming  that  the  City  could  raise  rates  in  the  same  manner  as  under  the  Concession  transaction,  and  had  adequate  capital  dollars  available  to  fund  meter  technology  upgrades, the City established its minimum acceptable bid of $1 billion at the high-end of  the  estimated  System  value.    This  target  is  affirmed  as  reasonable  and  fair  given  the  revenue assumptions that we utilized.  As it turned out, the winning bid was at the very  top range of the estimated value to the City based on this method.      Analysis of the Inspector General’s Report     While the Report represents an earnest attempt to analyze and critique the Concession,  we  believe  that  many  of  the  assertions,  assumptions  and  conclusions  contained  in  the  Report  are  not  correct.    It  appears  that  the  Report  reflects  a  number  of  conclusory  statements, the merits of which are impossible to determine since they are made without  citing  any  authoritative  sources  or  precedent.    Rather  than  attempt  a  point-by-point  rebuttal,  the  following  discussion  focuses  on  the  two  main  major  issues  raised  in  the  Report that deal with System value to the City.    Revenue vs. Free Cash Flow    The Report assumes $500,000 in annual capital expenditures for the System beginning in  year three.  Upon conversion to cashless payment meter technology, the System will be  comprised of approximately 4,000 meters with an average acquisition cost of $11,250 per  meter.    Meters  of  this  nature  typically  last  seven  to  ten  years  before  they  need  to  be  replaced.  Assuming the meters are replaced every 10 years, annual capital expenditures  would actually equal $4,500,000 (4,000 * 11,250 / 10 years).  This figure represents only  true capital costs and does not reflect any increases to operating expenses associated with  repair  and  maintenance  of  technologically  advanced  machinery  that  is  exposed  to  the  elements.  Further, it completely ignores any other capital expenditures throughout the  System.  It appears that the Report understates the cost of System capital expenditures  by $4 million every year, thus overstating the amount of System free cash flow in each  year.    The Report states that “Free Cash Flow” in year five in each of the five scenarios was  $85 million to $130 million.  The Report’s analysis then applies a discount rate to these  sums to determine value.  The Report’s analysis confuses the concept of free cash flow  with revenue, thus completely ignoring significant operating costs of at least $5 million  per year.  It appears that the Report understates the cost of operating the System by $5  million every year, thus overstating System free cash flow in each year.    These two mistakes combine to overstate annual free cash flow by $9 million per year.   Exhibit 3 (attached) demonstrates the impact that these mistakes have on the value of the  System for each of the Report’s revenue scenarios.          6  Discount Rate    Discount rates are applied by investors based upon perceived risk.  In determining the  applicable  discount  rate,  the  Report  cites  a  single  study  by  Partnerships  Victoria  to  determine  the  applicable  discount  rate.    According  to  this  study,  municipal-owned  projects fall in one of three risk categories:     Very Low: Discount Rate of 7.06%  Low: Discount Rate of 8.26%  Medium: Discount Rate of 10.4%   (cid:131)  (cid:131)  (cid:131)     (cid:131)  (cid:131)  (cid:131)   The Report states that the System should be placed in the “Very Low” category with a  discount  rate  of  7.06%.    However,  the  Partnerships  Victoria  study  specifically  places  parking  in  the  Low  category,  not  the  Very  Low  category.    Additionally,  the  System  clearly  meets  the  criteria  identified  by  Partnerships  Victoria  that  justify  placing  the  System in an even higher risk category than it would otherwise be placed:     Project value in excess of $500 million  Unique system risks  Demand risk is fully transferred     Therefore, correctly applying the Partnerships Victoria methodology would result in the  System being placed in the “Medium” category with a discount rate of 10.40%.    The Report does not state why it chose to place the System in the “Very Low” category,  but there is no stated logic behind that decision.  For example, the Partnerships Victoria  study places drinking water in the “Low” risk category.  Thus the Report implies that the  demand for drinking water is more elastic or risky than the demand for on-street parking.   This  unexplained  judgment  alone  causes  a  seismic  shift  in  the  estimated  value  of  the  System.  Exhibit 3 demonstrates the impact that this flaw has on the value of the System  for each of the Report’s revenue scenarios.    Correcting the Report’s mistakes with regard to confusing revenue with free cash flow  and  using  the  improper  discount  rate  creates  a  valuation  range  of  between  $848  million and $1.295 billion and clearly reflects the soundness of the winning bid – even  when evaluating it using the Report’s selected source.    More on Discount Rates    Again, the Partnerships Victoria report is only one source regarding the proper discount  rate for municipal-owned concession projects.  We are unaware why the author chose this  source.  It appears to be an obscure report produced over four years ago by an Australian  state government.  It is, however, readily available for download on the internet.  The  truth is, there is no generally accepted approach to determining the applicable discount  rate for municipal owned concession projects.  The City used discount rates in the range      7  of 10% to 14% for its valuation analysis.  The following is the logic behind the City’s  approach.      Definition  -  Discount  rate  is  defined  by  Investopedia.com  as  “the  interest  rate  used  in  determining  the  present  value  of  future  cash  flow”.    Simply  put,  it  is  the  rate  used  to  convert the value of dollars in the future into the value of dollars today.  For any given  valuation  analysis,  the  applicable  discount  rate  equals  the  “risk-free  rate”  plus  a  “risk  premium.”  Although the risk-free rate is a hypothetical rate, it is generally accepted by  financial analysts to equal the rate of a United States Treasury bond with a maturity equal  to the related cash flow stream.  The risk premium is specific to the risks attributable to  the specific investment being valued and is defined by Investopedia.com as “a form of  compensation for investors who tolerate the extra risk - compared to that of a risk-free  asset  - in  a  given  investment”.    For  example,  the  risk  premium  for  an  internet  start-up  company is higher than that associated with a well-established company like Microsoft,  given the greater risks related to a start-up business.      Risk-free rate - The current yield on a 30-year Treasury bond (i.e. the 30-year risk-free  rate) is approximately 4.591%.  Obviously, the term of the concession is 75 years, which  would suggest an even higher risk free rate.    Risk premium – The fact that City has shifted 75 years worth of considerable risk to the  concessionaire can not be ignored.  Infrastructure investors demand a higher return than  investors in bonds and stocks, which means that the risk premium for infrastructure assets  is  higher.    Typically,  a  diversified  stock  portfolio  has  a  risk-premium  of  3%  to  5%.   Depending upon the industry, A-rated corporate bonds currently have a risk-premium of  3% to 5%. As a stand alone revenue source, the System would achieve a credit rating of   BBB+ at best (compared with the City’s “AA” credit rating), requiring a higher premium  to compensate for the risks described below.    Conclusion  -  Even  risk-free  investments  (if  there  were  such  a  thing)  would  be  valued  using a discount rate of at least 4.5%.  The appropriate risk premium should be higher  than either a diversified stock portfolio or an A-rated corporate bond.  Accordingly, a risk  premium range of 5.5% to 9.5% would be more appropriate.  Based on a risk-free rate of  4.5%, this results in a discount rate range of 10.0% to 14.0%.    Alternative – One way to provide a reality check to the City’s discount rate of 10.0% to  14.0% is to ask the following hypothetical question: If the City issued $1 billion of bonds  secured  only  by  the  net  operating  revenue  of  the  System  (i.e.  no  general  obligation  backing by the City), what interest rate would they pay on those bonds?  Those bonds, if  they could be sold at all, would surely sell at double-digit yields.    Another  way  to  look  at  this  would  be  the  appropriate  discount  rate  the  City  would  be  advised to use if it were bidding on a similar system in another city -- Los Angeles, for                                                     1 The weighted average of System cash flows is greater than 30 years.  4.59% does not reflect this fact to  simplify the analysis.      8  WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY        EU ROPE L on do n Zu rich  AS IA T o kyo  Sha ng ha i  managed public equity offerings      their   firm,   (cid:131) Execution excellence  worldwide  NOR TH AM ERICA  C hi ca go Bost on   Ha rt for d  Ind ian ap olis    New  Yor k  San  Fra nc isco  (cid:131) Investment bank ng expertise  i  (cid:131) Dedicated cross-border transaction team  (cid:131) 100% owned by active principals  (cid:131) Leading “P3” financial advisor and bond   underwriter for the non-profit and public sectors  (cid:131) Ranked No.1 for aftermarket performance of   (cid:131) Relationship-driven investment bank  institutional   (cid:131) Comprehensive securities offering experience and   proven positioning expertise of sector leaders  equity  and   (cid:131) Breadth of industry coverage – in-depth, quality   research Leading middle market M&A advisor, advised on  $30.1 billion of transactions in 2007  (cid:131)  (cid:131) Name brand credibility and reputation (cid:131) Proven access to strategic and f inancial acquirers   (cid:131) Successful transactions/repeat clients (cid:131) Sophisticated wealth management services (cid:131) Lowest turnover in industry  (cid:131) Entrepreneurial with an intense client focus (cid:131) Senior bankers actively lead each transaction (cid:131) Continuity and consistency for 74 years (cid:131) Reputation for integrity, independence, and quality  William  Blair  &  Company  is  a  Chicago-based  investment  firm  offering investment banking, asset  research,  management,  institutional  private  brokerage,  and  private  capital  to  individual,  and  issuing  clients.

9809`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/Vandalism/Vandalism201005.pdf`Success`Success`1`1`Not a fillable PDF.`       Revenue Department Comments on a Recent Report    Concerning Parking Meter Vandalism      A recent report implied that vandalism is on the rise.  It is not.  Vandalism has actually declined.     During the summer of 2009, the parking meter concessionaire reported only 47 incidents of  vandalism including attempts to willfully damage parking meters.  In the months of May and June,  one vandalized meter was reported by the concessionaire per day.  In July and August, the  concessionaire reported a 50% reduction: only one vandalized meter every two days.      The concessionaire reports that more than 99% of the meter system is operational on average.   Graffiti has remained fairly stable throughout the summer of 2009. Graffiti usually is limited to  “tagging” or the act of writing a name or nickname on a meter, and typically has no impact on the  operation of the meter.  The concessionaire documented about 4.4 incidents per day in May/June  and about 5.5 incidents per day in July/August.       Vandalism or graffiti are nothing new.  The City’s meter mechanics regularly dealt with  intentionally broken and tagged meters.  And Chicago is not alone in this regard.  It takes just a  quick Google search to find cities from coast to coast that have dealt (and will continue to deal)  with vandalism.    Vandalism and graffiti of any kind are not tolerated by businesses and residents.  If you park at a  parking meter that is inoperable or would like to report graffiti on a parking meter, please call the  concessionaire’s 24 hour customer support line at 877.242.7901.  Inoperable or “tagged” parking  meters are addressed in just a few hours, a significant improvement over past years.  All repairs  are made at the concessionaire’s expense.

Effective date:  June 1, 2004    Formerly Ruling #86-1, as amended  Original effective date:  February 17, 1986  Amended:  March 1, 1989    In  general,  Section  4-156-020(A)  of  the  Chicago  Municipal  Code  Section 1.  (“Code”)  imposes  a  tax  upon  the  patrons  of  every  amusement  within  the  City  (the  “amusement tax” or “tax”).  Section 4-156-010 defines an “amusement” as including (1)  various exhibitions, performances, presentations or shows that a person may witness or  view,  (2)  various  entertainment  or  recreational  activities  in  which  a  person  may  participate,  and  (3)  paid  television  programming.    This  ruling  discusses  primarily  the  second category described above (i.e., entertainment or recreational activities in which a  person may participate).    Section 2.  In  general,  all  entertainment  or  recreational  activities  offered  for  public  participation or on a membership or other basis are amusements subject to the tax.  Code  Section  4-156-020.    This  includes  entertainment  and  recreational  activities  such  as  amusement  park  rides  and  games,  circuses,  carnivals,  fishing,  skating,  pleasure  boat  rides,  dancing,  bowling,  golf,  pool,  billiards,  swimming,  racquetball,  weightlifting,  and  bodybuilding.    Activities  that  are  primarily  educational  are  not  amusements and therefore are not subject to the tax.     Section 3.  The  tax  is  on  the  patrons  of  any  amusement  within  the  city.  The  tax  is  based  on  the  admission  fees  or  other  charges  for  the  privilege  to  participate  in  the  amusement.  Initiation fees and membership dues paid to a health club, racquetball club,  tennis club or a similar club or organization, when such club or organization is organized  and operated on a membership basis and for the recreational purposes of its members and  its members' guests, are exempt from the tax.  This exemption does not apply to any fees  paid or based upon, in any way whatsoever, a per-event or a per-admission basis.    Section 4.  The term “admission fees or other charges” includes, but is not limited to  any fee, charge or other consideration paid for the right to participate in the recreational  activity or entertainment.  This includes fees paid to a club or other organization, other  than initiation and membership fees referred to in section 3 above, for the right to use the  recreational or entertainment facilities of such club or other organization. Guest fees or  charges  paid  by  non-members  of  a  club  or  other  organization  for  the  right  to  use  the  recreational or entertainment facilities of such club or other organization also are taxable.   tennis,   However,  additional  fees  or  other  charges  paid  by  a  member  or  guest  solely  for  instructors (such as for tennis or racquetball instruction), or for the purchase of goods, are  not  taxable  charges,  because  they  are  not charges  for    amusements.    Such  non-taxable  charges  must  be  separately  stated  by  the  amusement  provider,  otherwise  they  shall  be  deemed to be part of the charge for the  taxable amusement.    Section 5.  The  amusement  tax  is  collected  by  the  amusement  provider  from  the  amusement patron.  The tax is collected at the time the taxable fees, dues or other charges  are paid.  All tax returns are to be filed with the department on an annual basis on or  before August 15 of each year in accordance with Sections 3-4-186 and 3-4-189 of the  Code,  and  all  tax  payments  are  to  be  made  in  accordance  with  either  Section  3-4-187  (payment of actual tax liabilities) or Section 3-4-188 (payment of estimated taxes).    Section 6.  recreational facilities, and one or more of such facilities are located outside the city, the  patron shall owe a tax only on a prorated portion of such fee and may exclude that  portion of the fee which relates to the actual percentage of time he or she enters and uses  such facilities located outside the city, as compared with the total time he or she enters  and uses all of the facilities.  The Department of Revenue shall also deem a proration  based upon the square footage of the recreational or entertainment space of the facilities  to be a reasonable proration.  Other systems of proration may be approved by the  Department, upon application to the Department. (This section does not apply to patrons  who pay a fee to enter, within the city, a mobile entertainment or recreational vehicle.)   If a patron pays one fee to enter and use two or more entertainment or

The amusement tax applies under the following circumstances:     ·  The boat operator provides a pilot, and the boat will travel on a route that is  predetermined by the boat operator and not subject to negotiation with the patron.     The transaction tax applies in either of the following circumstances:      ·  The boat is leased without a pilot.   ·  The boat is leased with a pilot and the patron/lessee may determine the route.  In  this  situation,  piloting  and  other  service  charges  will  not  be  subject  to  the  transaction  tax  if  these  charges  are  separately  stated.  The  remaining  charge  is  subject to the transaction tax.     All separately stated service charges must be supported by documentary evidence in  order to be non-taxable.

Section 4-156-030(B) of the Amusement Tax Ordinance, chapter 4-156 of the  Municipal  Code  of  Chicago,  requires  every  amusement  tax  collector  to  keep  accurate  books  and  records  of  its  business  or  activity,  specifically  including  original  source  documents.  Pursuant to this requirement, every  amusement tax collector must retain one  of the following:     a.   Admission tickets in the form and containing such information as provided  by section 2 below;          b.   c.   Cash register receipts; or   Such  other  records  in  a  form  previously  approved  in  writing  by  the  director of revenue.     Section 2.  If tickets are used, each ticket shall consist of at least two parts; one part shall  be issued to the patron, the other part shall be retained by the tax collector.  Each part of  the ticket shall state on its face the name and address of the place where the amusement is  being held, the amount paid for the ticket and the date of the event.  Tickets issued for  amusements that do not have a specific address where the amusement is held, such as  boat  tours  or  horse-and-carriage  rides,  shall  state  the  location  where  the  tour  or  ride  begins.  Tickets shall be issued in numerical order, and each part shall contain the same  serial number.    Section 3.  If an amusement tax collector retains both cash register receipts and admission  tickets, the admission tickets do not need to comply with section 2 of this ruling.    Section 4.  All source documents required by section 4-156-030(B) shall be retained for  at least four years after the end of the calendar year in which they are created; provided,  however, that an operator on an annual basis may request approval from the director of  revenue to discard source documents that were created more than one year earlier, and  the  director  will  grant  approval  if  he  or  she  determines  that  the  operator’s  source  documents contain all information required by section 4-156-030(B) and this ruling.     Section 5.  Pursuant to section 3-4-310 of the Uniform Revenue Procedures Ordinance,  chapter 3-4 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, tax collectors who violate section 4-156- 030(B) and this ruling shall be subject to  the fines and penalties set forth in section 3-4- 310, including a fine of not less than $50.00 nor more than $200.00 for the first offense.   The failure of a tax collector to retain required source documents also may result in the  department of revenue estimating additional amusement tax liability and issuing the tax  collector a tax determination and assessment.

Both of these amendments are  dependant on the maximum capacity of the venues in which the amusements will be conducted  and the nature of the related performances.   Tax Reduction on Certain Amusements:  Pursuant to revisions to section-4-156-020 E., the rate of tax on admission fees or other charges,  to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other live cultural performances that take  place in any auditorium, theater or other space in the city, whose maximum capacity, including  all balconies and other sections, is more than 750 persons and less than 5000 persons, has been  reduced to 3%.   Elimination of Tax on Certain Amusements and Maximum Capacity:  Pursuant to revisions to section 4-156-020 D., the amusement tax shall not apply to or be  imposed upon the admission fees to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other live  cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in the city whose  maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is not more than 750 persons.   If all of the amusements conducted in your venue meet the requirements of this section and  your venue AT ALL TIMES has a capacity of not more than 750 persons, you should  complete and return the enclosed affidavit according to the instructions included thereon.  Upon verification and approval, we will deactivate your amusement tax account.   Clarification of Effective Date:  Both of the rate amendments shall take effect on January 1, 1999. The 3% rate and the  elimination of tax, shall only apply to admission charges or other fees billed and paid on or after  January 1, 1999.

General Information  An amusement tax is imposed upon the patrons of every amusement within the city.  Section 4-156-020 provides for an exemption or for a reduced rate of tax for live cultural performances.  The Chicago Department of Revenue (“Department”) has released a tax ruling that specifies situations in which the Department will consider the activities of a DJ to qualify  as a ""live cultural performance"" at a dance club or other venue, and therefore qualify for the exemption or reduced rate set forth in Subsections 4-156-020(D)(1) and (E) of the Code.  This ruling, Amusement Tax Ruling #4, is attached to this bulletin.  What is the tax rate?  The rate of the tax shall be equal to eight percent of the admission fees or other charges paid for the privilege to enter, to witness, to view or to participate in such amusement, unless (1) the event is considered to be a live cultural performance at a venue with a maximum seating capacity of more than 750, in which case the tax rate is four percent (see subsection 4-156-020(E), or (2) the event is considered to be a live cultural performance at a venue with a maximum seating capacity of 750 or less, in which case the event is exempt (see subsection 4- 156-020(D)(1))  INFORMATIONAL BULLETIN  #Chicago Amusement Tax  Can all bars and night clubs claim the live cultural exemption for any night a DJ is playing?  How often is the Amusement Tax  remitted and when are returns due?  No.  The ruling sets very specific guidelines that dictate under which circumstances a DJ qualifies as live entertainment.  The ruling states that the DJ’s activities must substantially add to or otherwise modify the pre-recorded material used by the DJ, in the form of a significant degree of technical manipulation, singing, speaking, dancing or other activity.  Please refer to Amusement Tax Ruling #4 for further clarification on how to determine if the Department will deem a DJ to be live entertainment.  What if, after reading the Tax Ruling, I still cannot determine if the DJ can be considered a live cultural performance for Chicago amusement tax purposes?  If desired, at least 14 days in advance of an event involving a DJ, a venue may submit to the Department books and records showing the name of each DJ who will perform at the venue, the dates and times of each DJ performance, and the admission fees or other charges paid by patrons to witness the DJ at each of the dates and times at which each DJ performs, along with the DJ’s contract, and such other documents and information as the Department may reasonably require. The Department will endeavor to provide the venue with an advance written determination of whether or not the event qualifies for treatment as a live cultural performance.  The tax is to be remitted monthly with taxes collected in one month payable by the last day of the subsequent month.  The tax return for periods commencing on July 1st of each year and ending on June 30th of the subsequent year, is filed annually and is due by August 15th of each year.  Questions?

Please refer to the ordinance for exact terms.   What is considered an Amusement?  Per Code section 4-156-010, the term “amusement” includes:  “(3) any paid television programming, whether transmitted by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio, satellite or similar means.”  What is the tax rate?  Please visit our website for current tax rate information.  Our web address is  www.cityofchicago.org/revenue.  What is Mobile TV?  Mobile TV is a service which allows users to view paid television programming on their wireless phones.  The users are typically charged a monthly fee for this type of service, and the charge appears on their wireless phone bill.  Is Mobile TV an amusement?  Yes.  Mobile TV is a form of paid television programming that fits the definition of “amusement” per Code section 4-156-010 and is therefore subject to the amusement tax.   #Chicago Amusement Tax Who is responsible for payment of the tax?  The subscribers of the service are responsible for paying the tax to their wireless phone service providers.  Who is responsible for collection of the tax?  It is each wireless phone service provider’s responsibility to collect the tax and remit it to the Department.   How often is the tax remitted?  The tax is to be remitted monthly with taxes collected in one month payable by the last day of the subsequent month.  The tax return for periods commencing on July 1 of each year and ending on June 30 of the subsequent year, is filed annually and is due by August 15 of each year.    Once registered, returns and payments can be made through the U.S. postal service, in person, or online at www.cityofchicago.org/revenue  How do I determine which customers are subject to the Chicago Amusement Tax on Mobile TV?  The Department will accept use of the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act, 35 ILCS 638, as the basis for determining which Mobile TV customers are subject to the City’s amusement tax.  This is the same rule that is used to determine which wireless phone service customers are subject to the City’s simplified telecommunications tax, Code chapter 3-73.  Therefore, customers who are subject to the City’s   telecommunications tax on their wireless phone service charges are subject to the City’s amusement tax on any charges for Mobile TV.  Conversely, customers who are not subject to the City’s telecommunications tax on their wireless   phone service charges are not subject to the City’s amusement tax on any charges for Mobile TV.  Where a customer is subject to both the City’s telecommunications tax and the City’s amusement tax, the wireless phone service provider is responsible for collecting both taxes and remitting them to the  Department.

Section  4-156-020  of  the  Chicago  Municipal  Code  imposes  a  tax  upon  the  patrons  of  every  amusement  within  the  City.    The  tax  is  based  on  the  admission  fees  or  other  charges  for  the  privilege  to  enter,  to  witness,  to  view  or  to  participate  in the  amusement.    This  publication  is  a  summary.   Please consult the ordinance and any applicable rulings or other official statements for details.    What is an amusement?  In general, all entertainment or recreational activities offered for public participation or on a membership or other basis are  amusements subject to the tax.      How  do  I  know  if  my  event  is  taxable?    Examples  of  taxable  fees  or  charges  include  but  are  not  limited  to  those  for  sporting  events,  concerts,  movies, cover charges, pub crawls, sport and social clubs, tours, cruises, etc.      Who  is  responsible  for  collecting  and  remitting  the  tax?    Owners,  managers,  and  operators  of  amusements  or  places  where  amusements  are  conducted  and  resellers  must  collect  from  patrons  the  tax  imposed  by  the  amusement  tax  code.  Note:  ""Operator""  means  any  person  who  sells  or  resells a ticket to an amusement or who, directly or through an agreement or arrangement with another party indirectly,  collects the charges paid for  the sale or resale of a ticket to an amusement. The term includes, but is not limited to, persons engaged in the business of selling or reselling tickets to  amusements,  whether  on-line,  in  person  or  otherwise.  The  term  also  includes  persons  engaged  in  the  business  of  facilitating  the  sale  or  resale  of  tickets to amusements, whether on-line, in person or otherwise.    What is the tax rate?  The tax rate is 9% of charges paid.  The term ""charges paid"" includes any and all charges that the patron pays incidental to  obtaining  the  privilege  to  enter,  to  witness,  to  view  or  to  participate  in  an  amusement,  including  but  not  limited  to  any  and  all  related  markups,  service fees, convenience fees, facilitation fees, cancelation fees and other such charges, regardless of terminology.    The  capacity  of  my  venue  is  not  more  than  1,500  persons.    Are  my  events  exempt  from  the  tax?      The  Amusement  Tax  shall  not  apply  to  admission fees to witness in person live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in the city whose maximum  capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is not more than 1,500 persons.  Note: this exemption applies only to venues where admission  fees are paid to witness live cultural performances.  It does not apply to charges for movies, pub crawls, sporting events, etc.  The 9% Amusement  Tax will continue to apply to these types of amusements, regardless of venue capacity.      How should resale transactions be taxed?  The rate of tax imposed upon the buyer of a ticket in a resale transaction shall be equal to 3% of the  admission fees or other charges paid for the ticket in the resale transaction.   If the buyer in a resale transaction purchases the ticket for purposes of  resale,  then  no  tax  shall be  due  from  the  buyer  on  the  purchase  if  the  buyer  is  registered  with  the City's  Department  of  Finance  as  a  tax  collector  under Section 4-156-030.  Finally, if the original sale of a ticket is exempt, then the resale of that ticket is exempt as well.   How do I get registered with the Department of Finance? If you do not have an account number with the City of Chicago and your business does  not require a license issued by the City, complete and submit a Tax Registration Form and an Affidavit for Initial Tax Period.  If you already have an  account number with the City because you have a business license or are registered for another tax, you do not need to submit the Tax Registration  Form.  You  may  submit  the  Affidavit  for  Initial  Tax  Period  indicating  your  existing  City  of  Chicago  account  number.    Please  visit  our  website  at  www.cityofchicago.org to obtain these forms.   When is my payment due?  Amusement Tax must be remitted on or before the 15th day of the month following the month in which the liability was  incurred.   When is my tax return due?  Amusement Tax returns are due on August 15th for the preceding fiscal year of July 1st through June 30th.     How  do  I  apply  for  an  exemption?

General Information  The Chicago Amusement Tax  (Amusement Tax), Chapter   4-156 of the Municipal Code   of Chicago (Code), applies to   paid television programming,  including satellite TV.  The  Federal Communications Act  exempts satellite TV providers  from having to collect local  taxes, but it does not exempt  customers from having to pay  them.    Who is required to pay the  Amusement Tax?  Chicago businesses that  subscribe to and use satellite  TV are required to pay the  Amusement Tax directly to the  Chicago Department of Finance  (Department).  This includes  bars, restaurants, and all other  businesses that subscribe to  satellite TV.    How do I calculate the  Amusement Tax due?  As of the date of this bulletin,  the Amusement Tax rate is nine  percent of the charges paid for  satellite TV services used in  Chicago.  Please note, taxable  charges do not include this or  any other tax imposed on these  charges.             When are payments due?  In general, business subscribers  must pay the Amusement Tax  to the Department by the 15th of  each month for the previous  month if their total tax liability  is more than $1,200 per year. If  total tax liability is less than or  equal to $1,200 per year, the  Amusement Tax is due only  once per year by August 15th.   See Code Section 3-4-187 for  more details.    When is the tax return due?  The tax return for the fiscal  year, July 1st through June 30th,  is filed annually and is due by  August 15th of each year.  See  Code Section 3-4-186 for  details.    How do I register for the tax?    Applications can be found at             www.cityofchicago.org/finance  in the Tax Collection and  Enforcement section of the  webpage.     Voluntary Disclosure –  Special Limited Time Offer  Because many businesses were  previously unaware of their  obligation to pay the  Amusement Tax, the  Department is offering to accept  the payment of Amusement Tax  from July 1, 2015 to the date of  payment, waiving all interest  and penalties, and waiving all  liability for periods before July  1, 2015 (including Amusement          Tax, interest and penalties),   for any business that applies to  the Department by March 31,  2017.      Any business that wishes to  accept this offer should submit  the 2016 Voluntary Disclosure  Application for Business  Subscribers of Satellite  Television Services which is  included with this bulletin.    Why should I participate in  this Voluntary Disclosure  program?  Generally, the statute of  limitations is six years for non- filers.  If a business chooses not  to participate in this program  and the Department later  determines that there is  Amusement Tax liability, the  business may be assessed tax,  interest, and penalties for all  periods open under statute.    Additional Questions?  Additional tax information and  forms can be found at  www.cityofchicago.org/finance.     You may also contact us by  email at  revenuedatabase@cityofchicago .org or by phone at (312) 747- 4747.

Paid television programming specifically includes, but is not limited to, television  programming transmitted by cable. Implementation of this determination should be made within  sixty days. If additional time is needed, you must make a written request to the Department  stating the reasons in support of the request.   If you should have any questions, or require additional information, or if you wish to request  additional time for implementation, you may contact the Department in writing or by telephone  as follows:     City of Chicago  Department of Revenue  Tax Policy Division  333 South State Street, Ste. 300  c/o Raul Medina  Chicago, IL 60604-3977    Customer Service (312) 747-9723  TTY (312) 747-2975

For those Concession Metered Parking Spaces for which the Period of Operation or  the Metered Parking Fee varies during the Reporting Year, “Full Utilization Amount” means the  sum  of  the  product  of  each  Metered  Parking  Fee  in  effect  for  such  space  multiplied  by  the  applicable Period of Operation for such Metered Parking Fee during the Reporting Year.   Any  calculation of Full Utilization Amount shall assume that the then current Metered Parking Fee  and Period of Operation were implemented as of, and in effect continuously from, March 1 of  such  Reporting  Year.    For  any  Concession  Metered  Parking  Space  for  which  a  Regular  Rate  Adjustment became effective during January (unless an Expected Utilization Rate also became  effective for such space during January), the “Full Utilization Amount” as of the first Day of the  immediately following February shall exclude the effect of such Regular Rate Adjustment, and  such Regular Rate Adjustment instead shall be included in the Full Utilization Amount for such  space as of March 1.   “Governmental Authority” means any court, federal, state, local or foreign government,  regulatory,  administrative,   department,  commission,  board,  bureau,  agency  or  other  governmental or quasi-governmental authority.   “Hazardous  Substance”  means  any  solid,  liquid  gas,  odor,  heat,  sound,  vibration,  radiation or other substance or emission which is a contaminant, pollutant, dangerous substance,  toxic  substance,  hazardous  waste,  subject  waste,  hazardous  material  or  hazardous  substance  which  is  or  becomes  regulated  by  applicable  Environmental  Laws  or  which  is  classified  as  hazardous or toxic under applicable Environmental Laws (including gasoline, diesel fuel or other  petroleum  hydrocarbons,  polychlorinated  biphenyls,  asbestos  and  urea  formaldehyde  foam  insulation).   “Hours  of  Operation”  means,  with  respect  to  each  Metered  Parking  Space  and  with  respect  to  a  Metered  Parking  Fee,  the  current  number  of  annual  hours  during  which  the  City  permits the parking of a motor vehicle in that Metered Parking Space and requires the payment  of a Metered Parking Fee for use of that Metered Parking Space.   “Impacted  Concession  Metered  Parking  Spaces”  has  the  meaning  ascribed  thereto  in   Section 7.15.   “Implementation Date” has the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 7.15.   - 13 -

Although these observers, in many cases, make  an  earnest  attempt  to  analyze  the  value  of  the  System,  we  believe  that  many  of  their  assertions,  assumptions  and  conclusions  are  not  correct.    In  the  following  analysis,  we  illustrate the impact of these misconceptions, using as a basis of comparison information  presented  in  the  Report.    As  discussed  below,  the  two  most  significant  inaccuracies  contained in the Report are (i) its use of gross System revenue rather than free net cash  flow in estimating System value and (ii) its use of an inappropriately low discount rate in  estimating the value of the System to the City.  Our analysis confirms that by properly  projecting System revenues and by applying a discount rate that appropriately reflects the  relative risks of the System, the conclusion that the City received full and fair value for  the Concession of the System is clearly supported and affirmed.     The  City  of  Chicago  (the  “City”)  has  been  a  leader  among  American  state  and  local  governments  in  successfully  partnering  with  the  private  sector  by  pursuing  and  completing innovative long-term concessions of the Chicago Skyway, the underground  parking  garages  located  in  Grant  and  Millennium  Parks,  and  the  Chicago  Metered  Parking  System.    In  total,  those  transactions  have  provided  nearly  $3.6  billion  for  Chicago  residents  and  taxpayers.      Many  other  American  cities  now  hope  to  copy  Chicago’s success, particularly in the area of parking.    The  City  has  applied  the  nearly  $3.6  billion  of  proceeds  from  these  transactions  to:  establish long-term reserve funds of more than $1 billion, including $900 million for the  City and $120 million for the Chicago Park District, to replace revenue generated by the  Skyway, parking garages and parking meters; retire $925 million in debt; reserve more  than $700 million for mid-term budget relief in order to maintain essential City services;  and  invest  more  than  $322  million  in  neighborhoods,  parks  and  programs  that  serve  people most in need.    Each  of  the  three  successful  transactions  eliminated  long-term  risks  of  increased  operating  and  capital  expenditures,  while  mitigating  the  risk  of  future  changes  in  technology and in the behavior of the users of the assets.    After the $1.83 billion Chicago Skyway concession transaction closed, and the long-term  reserve was established, all three bond rating agencies upgraded the City's credit rating.   Today, the City enjoys its highest credit ratings since 1978.     The $563 million concession of the downtown parking garage system helped to pay off  all of the debt used to build Chicago's world-class Millennium Park, and allowed for a  shift  of  capital  resources  from  downtown  parking  garages  to  neighborhood  parks  throughout the city by investing $122 million in neighborhood park infrastructure.     The City’s announced policy is to pursue long-term public-private partnerships involving  infrastructure assets only when:        2  •  There is substantial potential financial benefit to the Chicago tax payers   and residents;   •  The  assets  involved  do  not  involve  the  core  competencies  of  City   government; and    •  Experienced  and  professional  operators  are  able  to  improve  efficiency,   quality of service and make enhanced capital investments in the assets.     City  policy  and  concession  agreements  further  require  that  private  operators  treat  employees  fairly,  provide  a  high  level  of  safety  and  security,  and  satisfy  strong  performance, operating and engineering standards.  Throughout each transaction, the City  has provided great transparency in the robust competitive bidding process and through  the planning of the use of concession proceeds.        How the City Estimated the Value of the System  and Determined the Minimum Acceptable Bid     The City and Blair worked together over a period of months to estimate the value of the  System to infrastructure investors, estimate the potential value of the System to the City  and  identify  the  minimum  bid  amount  that  the  City  would  accept  for  a  75-year  Concession.  Before  proceeding  with  the  transaction,  the  City  wanted  reasonable  assurance, using widely-accepted financial valuation methods applicable to infrastructure  assets,  and  incorporating  various  assumptions  concerning  rates,  utilization,  risk  allocation, discount rate and other factors affecting valuation, that a long-term concession  of the System would produce an upfront payment that would be both sufficient to replace  the revenues currently produced by the System and to produce a substantial premium that  would fairly compensate the City for a 75-year concession.      Infrastructure Investor Valuation Approach  Blair  used  a  multi-variable  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  to  estimate  the  value  of  the  System to infrastructure investors.  The value of the metered parking system is primarily  a function of two factors:        •  The  long-term  free  cash  flow  of  the  System  ---  estimated  operating  revenue  (which  makes  assumptions  about  driver  utilization),  minus  operating  expenses,  minus  capital  expenditures  and  corporate  tax  liabilities; and   •  The  bidder’s  cost  and  mix  of  debt  and  equity  financing  or  cost  of   capital.   In  estimating  the  value  of  the  proposed  long-term  concession  of  the  System,  Blair  prepared and continued to refine its multi-variable analysis using a variety of assumptions  for the factors that impact long-term free cash flow and the bidder’s cost of capital.  Blair  began  by  identifying  all  the  factors  that  impact  either  long-term  free  cash  flow  or  the      3  bidder’s cost of capital.  Next, Blair constructed a range of potential values for each of  those factors and assigned each potential value with a probability of occurrence.  As such,  the probabilities for all the potential values of a factor add up to 100%.  A scenario was  calculated for every possible combination of those factors, which produced thousands of  outcomes,  each  with  a  very  small  probability  of  occurrence  based  on  the  individual  probabilities of the factors.  The analysis produced a standard distribution of outcomes,  similar to a “bell curve” of grades in a college class.  Based on this bell curve, Blair was  able to predict a range of values based on confidence intervals.       Using the valuation method described above, Blair initially established a valuation range  for  the  Concession  of  between  $650  million  and  $1.2  billion.    While  this  range  was  refined during the bidding process, the top end of the range never exceeded $1.2 billion.       City Held System Valuation Approach     The estimated value of the System in the City’s hands is much more hypothetical.  As  such, there are several ways to approach the value of the System had the City not entered  into the Concession.    Approach 1 – Current Practices    In 2005, the City increased the rate on meters located in the Loop from $1.50 to $3.00 per  hour.  This marked the first time in many years that the City increased meter rates on  such  a  widespread  basis.    This  increase  affected  approximately  1,000  spaces  and  represented  only  3%  of  the  System.    More  importantly,  the  $0.25  hourly  rate  for  approximately 75% of the System had not been increased in over 20 years.  Exhibit 1  (attached) estimates the value of the System assuming continued operation by the City  and annual rate increases of 3.0%.  This assumption is probably aggressive given the fact  that the rates on 75% City meters had not increased in over 20 years.  During that 20-year  period, the rate of inflation average approximately 3.2% per year.     Using  this  valuation  method  and  a  discount  rate  ranging  from  10.00%  to  14.00%,  the  estimated  value  of  the  System  would  be  between  $177  million  and  $276  million  (see  Exhibit 1).      Approach 2 – Concession Practices    The  City  faced  two  significant  challenges  to  increasing  parking  meter  rates.    First,  as  discussed above, the rates on most meters in the System had not been increased in many  years  and  there  was  a  general  lack  of  uniformity  as  to  rates  and  hours  of  operation.   Second, there was also the challenge of acquiring the expensive “pay and display” meter  technology that would be needed to support higher meter rates.  The estimated total cost  (equipment and labor) for upgrading the City’s meter technology is approximately $50  million.    Given  the  other  higher  priority  demands  on  the  City’s  limited  capital  improvement funds, it seemed unlikely that adequate funding would be available from      4  City  capital  dollars  to  pay  for  the  prompt  acquisition  and  installation  of  new  meter  technology.      This valuation approach ignores these two challenges and the risks associated with each  and assumes that the City increased rates in the same manner as under the Concession  transaction.  Although many factors impact the value of the System to the City, the two  that have the largest impact are the reaction of parkers to rate increases during the initial  five years of rate increases and the City’s discount rate.    Starting  in  year  six  of  the  pricing  structure,  rates  increase  to  keep  pace  with  inflation.   Because beginning in year six rates do not increase on a real basis, there is no reason to  expect that utilization will be impacted solely by parking meter rates.  However, during  the first five years rates do increase substantially, in some cases going from $0.25 per  hour to $2.00 per hour.  The impact on utilization due to price increases is the elasticity  of  demand,  defined  as  the  percentage  impact  on  demand  when  price  changes  by  1%.   Obviously,  as  discussed  below,  utilization  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  a  variety  of  other factors, and the City has shifted all of these utilization risks to the concessionaire.    The Inspector General’s Report analyzes five separate revenue scenarios, which are each  produced by differing assumptions regarding the elasticity of demand for street parking.   The analysis that Blair prepared for the City analyzed the impact that all relevant factors  had on value, not just demand elasticity.  However, given that this is the only factor that  the Report used and to keep things simple, Exhibit 2 (attached) uses those scenarios and  produces a value for each:     (cid:131)  Scenario 1 - Year five revenue is $85 million – The estimated value of the  System is $515 million to $850 million, assuming a discount rate of 10.0%  to  14.0%  (see  discussion  below  concerning  the  calculation  of  discount  rates).     (cid:131)  Scenario 2 - Year five revenue is $100 million – The estimated value of  the System is $625 million to $1.024 billion, assuming a discount rate of  10.0% to 14.0%.                  (cid:131)  Scenario 3 - Year five revenue is $107.5 million – The estimated value of  the System is $678 million to $1.111 billion, assuming a discount rate of  10.0% to 14.0%.   (cid:131)  Scenario 4 - Year five revenue is $115 million – The estimated value of  the System is $732 million to $1.198 billion, assuming a discount rate of  10.0% to 14.0%.   (cid:131)  Scenario 5 - Year five revenue is $130 million – The estimated value of  the System is $839 million to $1.372 billion, assuming a discount rate of  10.0% to 14.0%.   5  Assuming  that  the  City  could  raise  rates  in  the  same  manner  as  under  the  Concession  transaction,  and  had  adequate  capital  dollars  available  to  fund  meter  technology  upgrades, the City established its minimum acceptable bid of $1 billion at the high-end of  the  estimated  System  value.    This  target  is  affirmed  as  reasonable  and  fair  given  the  revenue assumptions that we utilized.  As it turned out, the winning bid was at the very  top range of the estimated value to the City based on this method.      Analysis of the Inspector General’s Report     While the Report represents an earnest attempt to analyze and critique the Concession,  we  believe  that  many  of  the  assertions,  assumptions  and  conclusions  contained  in  the  Report  are  not  correct.    It  appears  that  the  Report  reflects  a  number  of  conclusory  statements, the merits of which are impossible to determine since they are made without  citing  any  authoritative  sources  or  precedent.    Rather  than  attempt  a  point-by-point  rebuttal,  the  following  discussion  focuses  on  the  two  main  major  issues  raised  in  the  Report that deal with System value to the City.    Revenue vs. Free Cash Flow    The Report assumes $500,000 in annual capital expenditures for the System beginning in  year three.  Upon conversion to cashless payment meter technology, the System will be  comprised of approximately 4,000 meters with an average acquisition cost of $11,250 per  meter.    Meters  of  this  nature  typically  last  seven  to  ten  years  before  they  need  to  be  replaced.  Assuming the meters are replaced every 10 years, annual capital expenditures  would actually equal $4,500,000 (4,000 * 11,250 / 10 years).  This figure represents only  true capital costs and does not reflect any increases to operating expenses associated with  repair  and  maintenance  of  technologically  advanced  machinery  that  is  exposed  to  the  elements.  Further, it completely ignores any other capital expenditures throughout the  System.  It appears that the Report understates the cost of System capital expenditures  by $4 million every year, thus overstating the amount of System free cash flow in each  year.    The Report states that “Free Cash Flow” in year five in each of the five scenarios was  $85 million to $130 million.  The Report’s analysis then applies a discount rate to these  sums to determine value.  The Report’s analysis confuses the concept of free cash flow  with revenue, thus completely ignoring significant operating costs of at least $5 million  per year.  It appears that the Report understates the cost of operating the System by $5  million every year, thus overstating System free cash flow in each year.    These two mistakes combine to overstate annual free cash flow by $9 million per year.   Exhibit 3 (attached) demonstrates the impact that these mistakes have on the value of the  System for each of the Report’s revenue scenarios.          6  of 10% to 14% for its valuation analysis.  The following is the logic behind the City’s  approach.      Definition  -  Discount  rate  is  defined  by  Investopedia.com  as  “the  interest  rate  used  in  determining  the  present  value  of  future  cash  flow”.    Simply  put,  it  is  the  rate  used  to  convert the value of dollars in the future into the value of dollars today.  For any given  valuation  analysis,  the  applicable  discount  rate  equals  the  “risk-free  rate”  plus  a  “risk  premium.”  Although the risk-free rate is a hypothetical rate, it is generally accepted by  financial analysts to equal the rate of a United States Treasury bond with a maturity equal  to the related cash flow stream.  The risk premium is specific to the risks attributable to  the specific investment being valued and is defined by Investopedia.com as “a form of  compensation for investors who tolerate the extra risk - compared to that of a risk-free  asset  - in  a  given  investment”.    For  example,  the  risk  premium  for  an  internet  start-up  company is higher than that associated with a well-established company like Microsoft,  given the greater risks related to a start-up business.      Risk-free rate - The current yield on a 30-year Treasury bond (i.e. the 30-year risk-free  rate) is approximately 4.591%.  Obviously, the term of the concession is 75 years, which  would suggest an even higher risk free rate.    Risk premium – The fact that City has shifted 75 years worth of considerable risk to the  concessionaire can not be ignored.  Infrastructure investors demand a higher return than  investors in bonds and stocks, which means that the risk premium for infrastructure assets  is  higher.    Typically,  a  diversified  stock  portfolio  has  a  risk-premium  of  3%  to  5%.   Depending upon the industry, A-rated corporate bonds currently have a risk-premium of  3% to 5%. As a stand alone revenue source, the System would achieve a credit rating of   BBB+ at best (compared with the City’s “AA” credit rating), requiring a higher premium  to compensate for the risks described below.    Conclusion  -  Even  risk-free  investments  (if  there  were  such  a  thing)  would  be  valued  using a discount rate of at least 4.5%.  The appropriate risk premium should be higher  than either a diversified stock portfolio or an A-rated corporate bond.  Accordingly, a risk  premium range of 5.5% to 9.5% would be more appropriate.  Based on a risk-free rate of  4.5%, this results in a discount rate range of 10.0% to 14.0%.    Alternative – One way to provide a reality check to the City’s discount rate of 10.0% to  14.0% is to ask the following hypothetical question: If the City issued $1 billion of bonds  secured  only  by  the  net  operating  revenue  of  the  System  (i.e.  no  general  obligation  backing by the City), what interest rate would they pay on those bonds?  Those bonds, if  they could be sold at all, would surely sell at double-digit yields.    Another  way  to  look  at  this  would  be  the  appropriate  discount  rate  the  City  would  be  advised to use if it were bidding on a similar system in another city -- Los Angeles, for                                                     1 The weighted average of System cash flows is greater than 30 years.  4.59% does not reflect this fact to  simplify the analysis.      8     example.  Again, in this theoretical case, Blair would advise the City to use a discount  rate of 10.0% to 14.0% given the risk.      More on Risk Transfer   The characterization of the System as a “very low risk” project is simply inaccurate and  without basis.  There are substantial risks associated with the operation and value of the  System  that  have  been  transferred  by  the  City  to  the  concessionaire.    The  concession  agreement requires the concessionaire to operate the System for 75 years, regardless of  changes  in  population,  economic  activity,  technology,  patterns  of  behavior,  and  the  myriad other factors that might affect the economic value of the System.  There was no  such thing as a parking meter 75 years ago—the first ones were installed in 1935. And if  you  go  fifty  years  farther  back  than  1935,  there  were  no  vehicles  powered  by  internal  combustion engines.  A lot can and will change in 75 years.  Chicago has experienced  meaningful  fluctuations  in  population  during  the  last  75  years.  There  is  substantial  uncertainty associated with the future availability and cost of motor fuel, vehicle-sourced  pollution  and  emissions,  improvements  in  public  transportation,  and  so  on.  Just  as  the  application of improved meter technology may enhance the value of the System, it is also  true that technological innovations may adversely impact the value of the System.  For  example, it may be that individual motor vehicles are replaced by other forms of personal  transportation that do not require as much or even any street parking.  The concessionaire  has  assumed  all  of  the  risks  associated  with  declines  in  System  utilization,  including  declines  related  to  rate  increases  and  those  driven  by  technology,  fuel  costs,  attractive  transportation alternatives and other factors.  All substantial risks have been transferred to  the  concessionaire,  many  of  which  may  adversely  affect  the  long-term  value  of  the  System.  Had the City continued operation of the System, it would retain these risks and  therefore need to attribute a significant risk premium itself that should be reflected in the  discount rate used in valuing the future cash flows from the System – even for the City.    While there is no purely mathematical way to assess these risks, it seems arbitrary and  inappropriate to characterize this concession a “very low-risk” endeavor over its 75-year  life.  As  discussed  above,  the  appropriate  discount  rate  should  reflect  a  substantial  risk  premium, whether or not the System is subject to the concession.    Conclusion  For the reasons discussed above, we believe that the System is much more valuable to the  City under the Concession.  The incremental value resulting to the City from completing  the Concession can be expressed in two ways:          (cid:131)   If the estimated value of the System operated by the City is between $177 to $276  million (see discussion above), the incremental value to the City resulting from  the concession is $880 million to $979 million     (cid:131)  The  City  deposited  $400  million  in  a  revenue  replacement  fund  to  generate  earnings  to  replace  he  net  revenues  it  previously  received  from  the  System  (increased by inflation each year), resulting in an incremental value to the City of      9  $756 million.  The City will also benefit from a risk transfer, as the investment  returns  on  the  revenue  replacement  fund  will  be  less  volatile  and  more  certain  than the cash flow produced by the System     Assuming that the City continued to operate the System, could implement the same rate  increases  and  expanded  days  and  hours  of  operation  included  in  the  Concession  and  could obtain adequate capital dollars to make required improvements in meter technology  needed to support the higher meter rates, the winning bid of $1.156 billion is at the high- end of the “best case” estimated range of value of the System,.  Further, utilizing even the  lowest appropriate discount rate of 10.0%, the estimated value of the System if operated  by the City is $845 million to $1.3 billion.    The winning bid $1.156 billion represented a very aggressive bid, reflecting the robust  competitive  bidding  process,  the  trophy  nature  of  the  asset  and  the  limited  number  of  American  public  infrastructure  investment  opportunities.    The  winning  bid  was  at  the  high-end of the estimated range of value of the System to a private infrastructure investor  and to the City under continued City operation.          10

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements  Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  these  financial  statements  in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation,  and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements  that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.   Auditors’ Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted  our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial statements are free from material misstatement.   An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the  financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment  of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making  those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal  control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of  accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management,  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion.   Opinion  In  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial position of Chicago Parking Meters, LLC. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  the  years  then  ended  in  accordance  with  U.S. generally  accepted  accounting principles.

Under  the  excess  earnings  method,  the  Company examined the expected economic returns contributed by the System’s fixed assets and the  Rights obtained under the Agreements, and then isolated the excess return, which were attributable  to the Rights. The cost approach was used in the valuation of the equipment.   (c)  Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with an initial maturity of three  months or less. Throughout the period, the Company may have cash balances in excess of federally  insured amounts on deposit with various financial institutions.   Amounts received by parking meters but not yet deposited into the bank account are treated as cash  (deposits in transit) and are included in the cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31,  2012 and 2011.   (d)  Cost of Goods Sold   Cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs associated with interchange and assessment fees for  credit cards and parking taxes.   (e)  Fixed Assets   Fixed assets are stated at cost and primarily consist of parking meters. The Company’s fixed assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  values of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company’s fixed assets are considered impaired  when their estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows are less than the carrying values of  such assets. To the extent impairment has occurred, the excess of carrying values of the Company’s  fixed assets over their estimated fair values will be charged to operations.   Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over two years for computer software, three years  for computer equipment, five years for land improvements, and seven years for equipment including  parking  meters.  Maintenance  and  repairs  are  charged  to  expense  when  incurred.  Expenditures  for  significant  betterments  and  improvements  that  extend  the  economic  lives  of  the  fixed  assets  are  capitalized.   (f)   Intangible Assets  Intangible assets are stated at cost and consist of the Rights ($1,146,255,186), which are amortized  on a straight-line basis over 75 years, resulting in annual amortization of $15,283,402 each year. The  Company’s definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  values  of  such  assets  may  not  be  recoverable.  The  Company’s  intangible  assets  are  considered  impaired  when  their  estimated  future  undiscounted  operating cash flows are less than the carrying values of such assets. To the extent impairment has  occurred, the excess of carrying values of the Company’s intangible assets over their estimated fair   7

Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial statements are free from material misstatement.    An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the  financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  entity’s  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal  control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of  accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management,  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion.   Opinion   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects, the financial  position of Chicago Parking Meters, LLC as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations  and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The  Company’s definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  values  of  such  assets  may  not  be  recoverable.  The  Company’s  intangible  assets  are  considered  impaired  when  their  estimated  future  undiscounted  operating cash flows are less than the carrying values of such assets. To the extent impairment has  occurred, the excess of carrying values of the Company’s intangible assets over their estimated fair  values will be charged to operations. No intangible asset impairment losses were recognized for the  years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.   (g)  Leases   Base rent associated with operating leases is recorded monthly on a straight line basis over the term of  the respective lease. Leased property and equipment meeting capital lease criteria are capitalized at  the lower of the present value of the related lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the  inception of the lease and are recorded as a component of fixed assets on the accompanying balance  sheets. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method based on the shorter of the estimated  economic useful life of the assets or lease term.   (h)  Revenue Recognition   Parking revenues from transient parking at the Company’s parking meters are recognized as cash is  received  for  coin  sales  and  as  transactions  are  authorized  for  credit  card  sales.  In  May  2014,  the  Company implemented a mobile phone parking application. Parking revenues from customers using  the Company’s mobile phone parking application are recognized as parking transactions are authorized  using customers’ prepaid balances. Customers’ prepaid balances of $2,991,894 are included in cash  and cash equivalents and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2014.   The  Company  is entitled to  compensation from  the City  in  accordance  with  the  Agreements in  the  event  that  the  City  implements  changes  to  the  System,  which  reduces  the  Company’s  revenues  (True-up Revenue). In addition, if the City implements certain changes to the System in accordance  with  the  Agreements  that  result in  an  increase  to the Company’s  revenue, the  City  has  a  right to  a  settlement credit, which results in a reduction of the Company’s revenue. A settlement credit amount  can  only  be  used  by  the  City  as an  offset against  future True-up  Revenue  owed  by  the  City  to the  Company, unless the Agreements are terminated prior to  February 29, 2084. True-up Revenue and  settlement credits are calculated and recognized when earned or incurred at the end of each quarter for  the reporting year defined in the Agreements (May 31, August 31, November 30, and February 28).  True-up Revenue amounts due from the City are recorded in accounts receivable on the accompanying  balance sheets. Settlement credit amounts the City has not utilized to offset future True-up Revenue  are recorded as other current liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets. Accounts receivable as  of  December  31,  2014  and  2013  includes  $1,593,077  and  $1,797,321,  respectively,  of  True-up  Revenue  due  from  the  City.  No  unapplied  settlement  credits  were  outstanding  as  of  December  31,  2014 and 2013.      8   (Continued)

Auditors’ Responsibility   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted  our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  financial statements are free from material misstatement.

On  December 4, 2008 and February 3, 2009, the Company entered into a concession agreement (as amended  and restated on June 5, 2013) and a side letter (collectively, the Agreements), respectively, pursuant to  which, effective February 13, 2009 (the Concession Start Date), it leased the System for a 75-year term  from the City of Chicago (the City) for a purchase price of $1,151,355,186. The Company has an exclusive  right and franchise during the lease term to operate and collect revenues from the System (Rights).   The members of the Company (Members) are Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Investors LP (MSII), North  Haven Infrastructure Partners LP (NHIP) (formerly known as Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners LP),  North Haven Infrastructure Partners A Sub LP (formerly known as Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners  A Sub LP), (collectively with MSII and NHIP, the MSIP Partnerships), and Deeside Investments, Inc.

The General Partner of the MSIP Partnerships (which own 50.100% of the Company in total) is Morgan  Stanley Infrastructure GP LP, an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co Inc. (Morgan Stanley). Deeside is owned  by two infrastructure investors who are not related to the MSIP Partnerships.   The Company’s net income or net loss and each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or expense included  in the determination of such net income or net loss shall generally be allocated among the Members in  proportion to each Member’s percentage interest. The Company does not have a defined dissolution date.   (2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted  accounting principles (GAAP).   (a)  Use of Estimates   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make  estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates  and assumptions have been made with respect to the initial purchase price allocation and useful lives  of assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   (b)  Acquisition of Parking Meters   The fair values of the assets acquired pursuant to the Agreements were recorded as follows:      6   (Continued)      Equipment$5,100,000 Intangible assets1,146,255,186 Purchase price$1,151,355,186 CHICAGO PARKING METERS, LLC   (A Delaware Limited Liability Company)   Notes to Financial Statements   December 31, 2016 and 2015   (g)  Leases   Base rent associated with operating leases is recorded monthly on a straight-line basis over the term of  the respective lease. Leased property and equipment meeting capital lease criteria are capitalized at  the lower of the present value of the related lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the  inception of the lease and are recorded as a component of fixed assets on the accompanying balance  sheets. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method based on the shorter of the estimated  economic useful life of the assets or lease term.   (h)  Revenue Recognition   Parking revenues from transient parking at the Company’s parking meters are recognized as cash is  received for coin sales and as transactions are authorized for credit card sales. In May 2014, the  Company implemented a mobile phone parking application. Parking revenues from customers using  the Company’s mobile phone parking application are recognized as parking transactions are authorized  using customers’ prepaid balances. Customers’ prepaid balances of $10,710,999 and $6,951,602 are  included in cash and cash equivalents and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,  respectively.   The Company is entitled to compensation from the City in accordance with the Agreements in the event  that the City implements changes to the System, which reduces the Company’s revenues (True-up  Revenue). In addition, if the City implements certain changes to the System in accordance with the  Agreements that result in an increase to the Company’s revenue, the City has a right to a settlement  credit, which results in a reduction of the Company’s revenue. A settlement credit amount can only be  used by the City as an offset against future True-up Revenue owed by the City to the Company, unless  the Agreements are terminated prior to February 29, 2084. True-up Revenue and settlement credits  are calculated and recognized when earned or incurred at the end of each quarter for the reporting  year defined in the Agreements (May 31, August 31, November 30, and February 28). True-up  Revenue amounts due from the City are recorded in accounts receivable on the accompanying balance  sheets. Settlement credit amounts the City has not utilized to offset future True-up Revenue are  recorded as other current liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets. Accounts receivable as of  December 31, 2016 and 2015 includes $5,153,783 and $2,654,465, respectively, of True-up Revenue  due from the City. No unapplied settlement credits were outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and  2015.   For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized True-up Revenue of  $15,740,662 and $8,637,891, respectively. These amounts are recorded in parking meter revenues on  the accompanying statements of income.   Based on the Agreements, the Company is entitled to receive exempt parkers annual excess loss  revenue (EPAEL), equal to the loss of revenue to the Company due to exempt parkers utilizing the  System free of charge that exceeds 6% of the Company’s annual parking meter revenue (determined  as of the end of February each year). Based on the annual parking meter revenues for the Agreement’s  reporting year ended February 29, 2016, the Company has recognized $171,456 of EPAEL revenue for  the year ended December 31, 2016. The revenue is included in parking meter revenues on the  accompanying statements of income.      8   (Continued)

and   WHEREAS,  given  (i)  the  ongoing  proliferation  of  signs  in  the  City,  many  of  which  are  either  grandfathered,  legal  non-conforming  signs or  illegal signs  not  permitted  or  registered  with  the  Department  of  Buildings,  (ii)  the  Federal  Highway  Beautification  Act  and  Illinois  Highway  Advertising  Control  Act  of  1971  500  foot  spacing  and  zoning  requirements  applicable  to  signs  adjacent to expressways,  (iii) the historical  subdividing  of  Chicago, which  means that  many  lots  adjacent  to  major  expressways  are  only  125 feet  to  150 feet  deep,  (iv)  expressways  that  abut  residential zoning districts, and (v)  the need to locate signs in places where City  Information and   1   other  Government  Information can be readily seen by vehicular traffic, the City is unable to build- out  a  viable  City  Digital  Network  to  communicate  City  Information  and  Other  Government  Information without amendments to the Zoning Ordinance; and   WHEREAS, the City Council finds that the amendments to the Zoning Ordinance set forth  in  this  ordinance,  are  necessary  to  establish  City  Digital  Signs  as  a  new  category  of  exempt  signs; and   WHEREAS, the City  Council further finds that  in order  to  narrowly tailor  such  exemption  so  as  to  preserve  the  aesthetic  and  public  safety  public  purposes  related  to  existing  sign  regulations  in  the  Zoning  Ordinance,  and  to  the  extent  consistent  with  the  additional  essential  public  purpose  of  communicating  City  Information  and  Other  Government  Information,  such  amendments  should  (a)  generally  impose  similar  regulations  applicable  to  off-premises  advertising  signs  when  feasible,  (b)  modify  such  regulations  when  necessary  or  appropriate  in  light of the existing signage in the City, the federal and state legal requirements cited above, and  the communication  and public purpose objectives ofthe  City Digital Network,  and (c) waive such  regulations  when  necessary  or  appropriate  for  the  viability  of  establishing  an  integrated  City  Digital Network; and   WHEREAS, such zoning  amendments  are set forth  below  in Section  7 of this  ordinance;   and   WHEREAS,  the  City  Council  finds  that  certain  additional  conforming  amendments  are  required  in  Chapter  10  of  the  Municipal  Code  (Streets,  Public  Ways,  Parks,  Airports  and  Harbors)  and  in  Chapter  13  of  the  Municipal  Code  (Buildings  and  Construction)  in  order  to  implement the City Digital Network;

and   WHEREAS,  as  a  condition  to  allowing  such  off-premises  advertising,  the  City  Digital  Network  shall  on  a  regular,  continuing  basis,  transmit  City  information  and  Other  Government  Information  during  all  such  times  as  the  City  Digital  Network  is  operative  and,  during  emergencies,  shall  broadcast  only  emergency  notices  of  the  City  (and/or  other  units  of  government); and   WHEREAS,  in  November  2011,  pursuant  to  that  Specification  No.  102277,  the  City  issued  that  certain  Request  for  Qualifications  (""RFQ"")  Pre-Qualification  for  Municipal  Marketing  Services, which, among other things, solicited proposals for the development  of City assets; and   WHEREAS, five respondents  submitted  proposals  related to the proposed  establishment   of a digital sign network; and   WHEREAS, the City deemed two of the respondents  as best qualified, and  subsequently   engaged such respondents in a seven (7) month competitive process;

and   WHEREAS, the City further  required such two finalist companies to, among  other things,  negotiate  and  agree  to  tine  terms  of  a  Coordinated  City  Digital  Sign  Program  Agreement  governing  installation,  programming,  operation,   the  design,  manufacturing,  assembly,   maintenance, repair, replacement and, if required, removal of the City Digital Network; and   WHEREAS, after a review  of the two finalist  companies'  submissions  and proposals, the  Evaluation  Committee  determined  that  Interstate  JCDecaux,  LLC,  a  Delaware  limited  liability  company  (the ""Contractor""), was best qualified to work with the City in developing  and  operating  the City Digital Network; and   WHEREAS,  the  City  finds  that the  establishment  of  a City  Digital  Network  at  no  cost  to  the City through a public-private  undertaking will advance the essential public purpose  objectives  of  communicating  City  Information  and Other  Government  Information  in  a timely  and  effective  manner, which  information will  increase  public  awareness  of City  laws, services  and events  and  will enhance public safety; now, therefore   BE  IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO:   SECTION 1.

The LMCC did this by con-stantly reviewing and adjusting the Health Plans to hold year-over-year Plan cost increases at or below 8%. ****For 2017, new LMCC initiatives to improve plan efficiency*****1.The Wellness Plan no longer requires annual screenings. Now screenings are every 3 years (exceptfor new hires, previous non-participants and newly covered spouses).  Other changes will be ex-          plained in the December launch materials sent to your home.2.For physical and occupational therapy, coverage extended to acquisition of function, with acopay of $20 per visit. Starting in 2017, physical therapy will become subject to utilization reviewafter seven visits in any year.3.Dental/Vision: The dental and vision coverage is carved out from the medical plan and offerenhanced benefits. For vision: improved contact lens formulary, eliminated co-pay for lens scratchcoating. For dental PPO: the PPO annual maximum increased to $1,500, sealants covered every 5years for a child under age 14; drops semi-annual bite-wing X-rays, in-network coverage increasesfrom 60% to 80% for basic and restorative services, and crowns covering an abutmentare added while other services related to implants are not covered. For dental HMO,orthodontia copay for a child dropped from $2,300 to $1,800, copays for periodontal surgery andendodontic services are reduced about 50%.4.Over the Counter medicines are no longer covered as of July 1, 2016.5.Erectile Dysfunction medicines will not be covered. Medication for Benign Prostatic Hypertrophywill continue to be covered.6.Prescription Value Formulary -- No coverage for certain brands where other options are availablein a therapeutic class. Appeals are based upon medical need.7.Pilot PPO programs of telemedicine, mandatory second opinions, diabetes monitoring deviceand comprehensive care physician model are new. Second opinions are mandated for a selectlist of non-emergency surgeries where strong evidence shows that reviews will reduce the numberof unnecessary surgeries while giving patients a best-in-class medical review as well as sound alternatives. Patients will make the final decision on whether to have surgery.8.Outpatient surgeries will require pre-certification.11  Plan A effective 1/1/2017.

Chronic Disease Care Management integrates treatment and benefits, and focuses on users with       the highest costs and risks of becoming chronically ill.   3. Maternity Care: The maternity management program is expanded and women receive a $100      benefit upon successful completion of the program.  4. Tiered PPO Plan — In-network PPO hospitals and related providers qualify in one of two tiers. Tier          I offers the most savings for both the City and members but Tier II charges more, with lower       discounts. The level of coinsurance is set at point of service.  5. Emergency Room: Copays apply for visits that did not lead to admission. Members save by       using urgent care and after-hour physicians.  6. Primary Care Physicians versus specialists — HMO office visit copays increased to $25 for primary         care and $35 for specialist care. There are no copays for wellness visits in the HMO or PPO plan.   7. Laboratory Costs and Radiology Services:  Using hospital facilities increases costs in hospital fees       for lab and radiology services. For lab-work and scans by a PPO provider not billed by a hospital,          the Plan pays 100% of the expense.   8. Centers of Distinction: Certain transplants and bariatric surgeries must be performed at recog-           nized Centers of Distinction, with demonstrated records for higher quality treatment.   9. Specialty Medications:  Using a specialty medication (injectable, infused, oral, or inhaled drugs       with special handling) follows the Specialty Medication Program, not retail.   10. Reviews for MRI, PET, and CAT scans: Reviews ensure that the scans are medically necessary, and             to reduce unnecessary radiation.  11. Mail Order Maintenance Meds: Members save money by filling maintenance prescriptions by          mail. After the 3rd fill, members use mail or see their copayments for these meds double.                                              We look forward to working with you to improve your health benefits in 2017.  Sincerely,   City of Chicago Benefits Office     2 2  Plan A effective 1/1/2017.

Save by using doctors and hospitals in the PPO Tier 1 network: The PPO gives you freedom to choose from  three different network tiers. You can select doctors and hospitals (providers) from Tier 1 for some of your care, and use Tier 2 or  Tier 3 providers for other services. You pay the lowest deductible and coinsurance when you use providers in  Tier 1. To find a Tier 1 provider call 1-800-772-6895 or go to www.bcbsil.com/cityofchicago.  Two ways to save on prescription medications:  1) Choose generic medications and pay the lowest copay. 2) Use  mail order for long term “maintenance” medications. You will pay more if you don’t use mail order for long term medications  after the 3rd fill.  Save on lab tests – use a free-standing lab: Get your lab tests paid in full by using a free-standing lab (such as a Quest  lab) which is not affiliated with a hospital. Even if your doctor already has an arrangement with Quest, ask for a lab order for tests  to be done at a Quest facility. Take this paperwork to the Quest lab and test results will be sent directly to your doctor.  Call 1-866- 697-8378 to find the location of a Quest lab near you, or go to www.Questdiagnostics.com.  Save on scans – use a free-standing imaging center: Scans are covered in full if done at a fee-standing imaging center. When  your doctor orders an MRI, CT, or PET scan, call Telligen at 1-800-373-3727 to pre-certify the test and locate a free-standing  imaging center near you.   Become pregnant?  Earn a $100 incentive:  Enroll in a free, confidential maternity management program designed  to encourage a healthy baby by providing telephone support for moms-to-be. To qualify for the $100 incentive, call Telligen (1- 800-373-3727) to enroll and complete at least eight doctors’ visits during the pregnancy.  Free  diabetes  medication  for  diabetes  management  participants:  Two  voluntary  diabetes  management  programs are offered to PPO members free of charge.

(Ya sea por correo o personalmente, pero no de ambas maneras)   PARA PAGAR POR INTERNET: visítenos en aqui.  PARA PAGAR POR CORREO: adjunte un cheque o giro a la orden de City of  Chicago  en  este  sobre  y  marque  el  casillero  que  dice  “pago  adjunto”  en  el  presente aviso de infracción. Remítase al dorso para ver la multa aplicable. NO  ENVÍE DINERO EN EFECTIVO.  PARA  PAGAR  PERSONALMENTE:  lleve  este  sobre  a  cualquiera  de  los  centros incluidos en la lista.   Según  la  ordenanza,  se  admiten  los  siguientes  fundamentos  para  objetar  una  infracción:   1. el demandado no era el propietario ni el arrendatario del citado vehículo en   el momento de producirse la infracción;   2. el vehículo mencionado o sus placas patente de registro estatal habían sido   robados cuando tuvo lugar la infracción;   3. faltaban los carteles correspondientes que indicaban que se trataba de un   área de estacionamiento prohibido o restringido, o no eran claros;   4.  el  parquímetro  relevante  no  funcionaba  o  funcionaba  mal,  sin  que  el   demandado tuviera la culpa de ello;   5. los hechos que se alegan en el aviso de infracción por mal estacionamiento  o incumplimiento son inconsistentes o no se refieren a un hecho que viole  la norma específica (por ejemplo, Artículos 9-64-125 y 9-76-170: cuando  se  produjo  la  infracción,  la  persona  llevaba  menos  de  treinta  (30)  días  como residente de la Ciudad, o no habían transcurrido al  menos treinta  (30)  días  desde  la  compra  del  citado  vehículo;  Artículo  9-76-220:  el  vehículo cumple con los requisitos para uso médico, según se dispone en  el Capítulo 625 de la sección de Transporte de los Estatutos Compilados  de Illinois [ILCS, Illinois Compiled Statutes] Art. 5/12 - 503(g), etc.);   6.  la  condición  ilegal  que  se  describe  en  el  aviso  de  infracción  por   incumplimiento no existía en el momento en que se emitió dicho aviso;   7. la infracción por incumplimiento se había corregido antes de la audiencia;  siempre y cuando, no obstante ello, que esta defensa no se aplicará a los  Artículos 9-64-125; 9-76-140(a); 9-76-160 (a), (f); y 9-76-220.   Si su vehículo estaba en poder de un asistente de estacionamiento en la fecha y  hora que se produjo la infracción, usted tiene sesenta (60) días para presentar  una copia clara y legible del recibo de estacionamiento asistido, de conformidad  con el Art. 4-232-080(d).  PARA  OBJETAR  POR  CORREO:  marque  el  casillero  que  dice  “objetar  por  correo” y complete con su nombre y domicilio. Utilice el sobre para enviar una  declaración  firmada  en  la  que  se  describan  los  hechos  que  establecen  una  defensa. La declaración debe estar firmada por el propietario registrado. Adjunte        COPIAS de todos y cada uno de los documentos (por ejemplo, fotografías,  denuncia policial o el registro de su automóvil) necesarios para demostrar que  usted no es responsable. INCLUYA EL NÚMERO DE BOLETA DE DIEZ  DÍGITOS EN TODOS LOS DOCUMENTOS DE RESPALDO. El número de  boleta de diez dígitos es la serie contigua de números impresos en el extremo  superior izquierdo de este aviso de infracción. Dicho número incluye todos los  ceros de adelante. NO ENVÍE DOCUMENTOS ORIGINALES PORQUE NO  LE SERÁN DEVUELTOS. Le enviarán por correo la decisión de la audiencia.  PARA OBJETAR EN PERSONA: en presencia de un oficial de audiencias,  marque el casillero que dice “pedido de audiencia en persona”, complete con su  nombre, dirección y número de teléfono para llamarlo de día y envíe este sobre  por correo. Le notificarán las opciones de fechas y horarios para la audiencia por  correo. Todas las notificaciones le serán remitidas por correo al domicilio del  propietario registrado, según consta en la Secretaría de Estado.  SI USTED NO RESPONDE ESTE AVISO DE INFRACCIÓN, PUEDE  DICTARSE UNA DECISIÓN DE RESPONSABILIDAD EN SU CONTRA. Si  no se paga la multa dentro de los 21 días posteriores a la decisión de  responsabilidad, es probable que se sume una penalidad por pago en mora, cuyo  importe puede ser equivalente al de la multa. La decisión se considerará  definitiva a los efectos de la revisión administrativa y judicial. Si usted acumula  3 ó más decisiones definitivas de responsabilidad por mal  estacionamiento/incumplimiento, cualquier vehículo que sea de su propiedad  puede ser secuestrado y confiscado hasta que haya pagado todas las multas.  Después de 10 decisiones definitivas de responsabilidad por mal  estacionamiento, la Ciudad enviará la certificación a la Secretaría de  Estado, indicando que usted puede ser elegible para que le suspendan la  licencia de conductor. Una decisión definitiva puede ejecutarse de la misma  manera que una sentencia dictada por un tribunal competente. Las decisiones  definitivas quedan sujetas a cobranza por medio de agencias de cobranza y por  acción de la oficina de crédito, y la imposición de gravámenes sobre bienes  raíces y personales. La emisión o renovación de cualquier licencia otorgada por  la Ciudad —lo cual incluye licencias comerciales y como chofer particular—  pueden quedar suspendidas por no pagar las boletas que se encuentren en estado  de decisión definitiva. Todo gasto en el que la Ciudad hubiera incurrido para  ejecutar la decisión, incluidos, entre otras cosas, los honorarios de los abogados  y las costas judiciales, serán deudas pendientes con la Ciudad.

Para  saber  si  se  requi- ere  dicho  permiso,  póngase  en  contacto  con  el  Departamento de Asuntos Comerciales y Permisos  al 312-74G-OBIZ.   He aquí algunos consejos: •		Se requiere un permiso (Junk Peddler License)  para  recolectar,  transportar  o  deshacerse  de  chatarra.  •		Se  requiere  un  permiso  (Scavenger  License)  para  el  servicio  particular  de  recolección  de  basura. La inspección anual de estos camiones,  realizada  por  el  Departamento  de  Limpia  Pública, es obligatoria.   •		Se requiere un permiso (Mobile Food License)  para  vender  comida  directamente  desde  un  vehículo. Todos los alimentos deben ser previa- mente preparados y empaquetados. En algunos  distritos  de  Chicago  se  prohíben  los  camiones  que	venden	comida	(‘loncheras’).  Secretario de Estado—Placas B: El  Secretario  de  Estado  de  Illinois  requiere  que  algunos  camiones  exhiban  placas  de  circulación  tipo B. Para más información al respecto, consulte  www.cyberdriveillinois.com.  Permisos para camiones con  sobrepeso o tamaño excesivo: Se  pueden  requerir  permisos  especiales  para  vehículos  que  sobrepasan  los  límites  estableci- dos  de  peso  y  tamaño.

Daley Alcalde  Información importante sobre  el estacionamiento de camiones  comerciales en Chicago ¿Se puede estacionar un camión  comercial en una calle comercial?  •		Sí,  pero  sólo  mientras  dicho  vehículo  hace  entregas  o  provee  servicios  a  clientes  (p.ej.,  contratistas, electricistas, plomeros, entrega de  muebles u otros artículos, etc.), o sólo durante  las  operaciones  oportunas  de  carga  o  descar- ga.  •		Los  vehículos  estacionados  en  calles  mientras  no proveen servicios a clientes, están sujetos a  ser inmovilizados.  ¿Puede estacionarse un camión   comercial en una calle residencial?   Sí, pero sólo mientras dicho camión (sin importar  su peso) está haciendo entregas o prestando ser- vicios  a  clientes  (p.ej.,  contratistas,  electricistas,  plomeros,  entrega  de  muebles  u  otros  artículos,  etc.), o sólo durante las operaciones oportunas de  carga o descarga.  O:  Cuando se exhibe el permiso de camión residen- cial en el vehículo y éste está estacionado cerca  del domicilio de su dueño. Esta excepción es apli- cable sólo en determinados distritos (wards).  ¿Qué consecuencias trae el  estacionamiento de vehículos comerciales en zonas prohibidas? El  vehículo  puede  ser  inmovilizado  inmediata- mente,  con  multas  de  $60  por  la  inmovilización  y  $125  por  infracción  de  tránsito.  Para  los  camiones con peso superior a 4,500 libras, estas  multas  suben  a  $400  y  $125,  respectivamente.  Los  vehículos  inmovilizados  pueden  ser  remol- cados,  con  multas  adicionales  por  remolque  y  almacenaje.  ¿En qué circunstancias puede ser  inmovilizado un vehículo comercial? •		Cuando está estacionado en una calle y no está   proveyendo servicios.  •		Cuando está estacionado en una calle residen- cial  en  un  distrito  que  no  permite  el  estacio- namiento  de  camiones  y  no  está  proveyendo  servicios.  •		Cuando está estacionado en una calle residencial  en un distrito que sí permite el estacionamiento  de camiones pero no exhibe el permiso corre- spondiente y no está proveyendo servicios.  •		Todo vehículo registrado en su nombre puede  ser  inmovilizado  (booted)  si  usted  acumula  3  o más multas en estado de determinación final  (final determination status) o 2 multas en estado  de  determinación  final  de  más  de  un  año.

Pursuant  to  chapter  4-236  of  the  Chicago  Municipal  Code,  the  Chicago  Parking Lot and Garage Operations Tax (the “parking tax” or “tax”) is imposed upon the  use and privilege of parking a motor vehicle in or upon any parking lot or garage in the  City of Chicago.  Under Section 4-236-020(c), the tax does not apply to residential off- street  parking  of  house  or  apartment  tenants  or  condominiums  required  by  the  City  of  Chicago Zoning Ordinance, wherein an arrangement for such parking is provided in the  house or apartment lease or in a separate writing between the landlord or tenant, or if in a  condominium between the condominium association and the owner, occupant or guest of  a unit, whether the parking charge is payable to the landlord, condominium association,  or to the operator of the parking lot or garage.    Section 2.  To claim the exemption set forth in subsection 020(c), the landlord/operator  must maintain supporting documentation.  If called upon by the Department of Revenue,  the landlord/operator will be required to substantiate the claim by producing the lease,  separate writing or other supporting documents.  Failure to provide proof acceptable to  the Department will bar the landlord/operator from claiming this exemption, in which  case the landlord/operator will be liable for the unpaid tax, plus interest and applicable  penalties.

Pursuant  to  chapter  4-236  of  the  Chicago  Municipal  Code,  the  Chicago  Parking Lot and Garage Operations Tax (the “parking tax” or “tax”) is imposed upon the  use and privilege of parking a motor vehicle in or upon any parking lot or garage in the  City of Chicago.    Under Section 4-236-020(a) the tax is due when consideration is paid  for the privilege of occupying a space in or upon any parking lot or garage in the City of  Chicago.  See also section 4-236-020(h).    Section 2.   It shall be presumed that the consideration paid by a person for valet parking  includes  payment  for  the  privilege  of  occupying  a  parking  space  since  the  parking  tax  becomes due whenever payment is made for use of a space in a parking lot or garage.  Valet  parking  operators,  as  defined  by  Section  4-232-050(a),  are  therefore  required  to  collect the parking tax and remit it to the Department of Revenue, except as provided in  section 3 and 4 below.    Section 3.    Under Section 4-236-010, the parking tax does not apply to motor vehicles  parked on the public way.  Therefore, a valet parking operator that parks a motor vehicle  on  the  public  way  is  not  obligated  to  collect the  tax  in  that  instance.    A  valet  parking  operator claiming no tax liability, or claiming a reduced liability, pursuant to this section  3 shall have the burden of proving to the Department that the parking occurred on the  public way and not in  a parking lot or parking garage.    Section 4.   A valet parking operator is not required to collect or remit the parking tax if  the valet parking operator or the recipient of the parking space pays the tax to a parking  lot or garage operator other than the valet parking operator.    Additional rules relating to the tax collection responsibilities of valet parking operators    may be promulgated.

This  bulletin discusses certain issues pertaining  to the Tax and what tax rate applies to  specific situations.     General Information     The Tax is imposed on the use and  privilege of parking a motor vehicle in or  upon any parking lot or garage in the City  of Chicago. The ultimate incidence of and  liability for payment of the Tax is on the  parking recipient.      Amendments to the Parking Tax     On April 10, 2013, the City Council passed  amendments which are effective July 1,  2013. The amendments include the  following changes to the daily, weekly and  monthly rates (with the old rates stricken  and the new rates underscored):    4-236-010 Definitions.    The following definition was added to the  ordinance    “Charge or fee paid for parking"" means the  gross amount of consideration for the use  or privilege of parking a motor vehicle in  or upon any parking lot or garage in the  City of Chicago, valued in money, whether  received in money or otherwise, including  cash, credits, property, and services,  determined without any deduction for costs  or expenses whatsoever, but not including  charges that are added to the charge or fee  on account of the tax imposed by this  chapter or on account of any other tax  imposed on the charge or fee. The term  ""charge or fee for parking"" shall exclude  separately stated charges not for the use or   (cid:132) Chicago Parking Tax (cid:132)   privilege of parking. If any separately  stated charge is not optional, it shall be  presumed, unless proved otherwise, that it  is part of the charge for the use or  privilege of parking.    4-236-020 Tax imposed.    (a) Except as otherwise provided by this  Section 4-236-020, there is imposed upon  the use and privilege of parking a motor  vehicle in or upon any parking lot or  garage in the City of Chicago a tax of  $5.00 for each such motor vehicle parked  in or upon each parking lot or garage for  every 24-hour period or fraction thereof;  provided, however, that if the charge for  parking is made on a weekly or monthly  basis, the tax shall be calculated at the rate  of $25.00 per week or $120.00 per month,  respectively at the applicable rate set forth  in subsection (d).    (Omitted text is not affected by this  ordinance)    (d) (i) The tax imposed by this chapter  shall not apply if the charge or fee  imposed for the privilege of parking does  not exceed $2.00 for a 24-hour period or  less, or $10.00 for a weekly period or  $40.00 for a monthly period.    (ii) The tax imposed by this chapter for the  privilege of parking for a 24-hour  period or less shall be $1.00, if the charge  or fee is greater than $2.00 but less than  $5.00; $1.75, if the charge or fee is $5.00  or more but less than $12.00; $3.00, if the  charge or fee is $12.00 or more and paid  18% of the charge or fee paid for parking  on a Saturday or Sunday; and $5.00, if  the charge or fee is $12.00 or more and  paid 20% of the charge or fee paid for  parking on a Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.    (iii) The tax imposed by this chapter for  the privilege of parking on a weekly  basis shall be $5.00 if the charge or fee is  greater than $10.00 but less than $25.00;  $8.75, if the charge or fee is $25.00 or   more but less than $60.00; and $25.00, if  the charge or fee is $60.00 or more 20% of  the charge or fee paid for parking.    (iv) The tax imposed by this chapter for  the privilege of parking on a monthly  basis shall be $20.00 if the charge or fee is  greater than $40.00 but less than $100.00;  $35.00, if the charge or fee is $100.00 or  more but less than $210.00; $90.00, if the  charge or fee is $210.00 or more but less  than $300.00; $110.00 if the charge or fee  is $300.00 or more but less than $100.00:  and $120.00 if the charge or fee is $100.00  or more 20% of the charge or fee paid for  parking.    (v) The tax rates set forth in subsection (a)  subsections (d) (ii) - (iv) shall be deemed  to apply to the privilege of parking a  motor vehicle in a parking lot or garage  unless the taxpayer or tax collector keeps  accurate and complete books and records  as required by this chapter showing that  either a reduced rate or no tax applies.    Clarification of the application  of the new daily parking tax  rates to specific situations    Weekday/Weekend overlap    Where a taxable period of 24 hours or less  starts on a weekday and ends on a  weekend, the weekend rate of 18% will  apply to that entire period.  Conversely,  where a taxable period of 24 hours or less  starts on a weekend and ends on a  weekday, the weekday rate of 20% will  apply to that entire period.    Where a taxable period of 24 hours or less  starts and ends on a weekend, the weekend  rate of 18% will apply to that entire  period.  Conversely, where a taxable  period of 24 hours or less starts and ends  on a weekday, the weekday rate of 20%  will apply to that entire period.         Example #1    If a customer parks in a garage at 8:00 a.m.  on Friday and leaves at 8:00 a.m. on  Saturday, the Tax due for that period is  computed using the 18% rate.    Example #2    If a customer parks in a garage at 8:00 a.m.  on Sunday and leaves at 8:00 a.m. on  Monday the Tax due is computed using the  20% rate.    In both situations above the tax rate that  applies depends on when the parking  charge is paid. Both situations assume the  charge is paid when the customer leaves  the parking facility.  Generally the tax is  calculated when the payment is made.   Monday through Friday the 20% tax rate  applies. On Saturday and Sunday the lower  18% tax rate applies.     Example #3    If a customer parks at an airport at 10:00  a.m. on Monday and leaves at 10:00 a.m.  on Saturday, the 20% tax rate applies to  each of the 24 hour periods starting at  10:00 a.m. on Monday, 10:00 a.m. on  Tuesday, 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday, and  10:00 a.m. on Thursday, with 18% tax rate  due for the period of 10:00 a.m. Friday to  10:00 a.m. Saturday.  If the customer  instead leaves at a later time on Saturday,  the weekend rates apply to any taxable  charges for the additional time.     Example #4    A hotel guest enters the garage at 10:00  a.m. on Saturday and departs at 10:00 a.m.  on Monday.  An 18% tax is due for the  period of 10:00 a.m. Saturday to 10:00 a.m.  Sunday, and a 20% tax is due for the period  of 10:00 a.m. Sunday to 10:00 a.m.  Monday. If the customer instead leaves at a  later time on Monday, the weekday rates  apply to any taxable charges for the  additional time.    Advance Purchase Situations    Defined Event    A customer pre-purchases a book of passes  for a sports team’s home games where  parking passes are on pre-defined game  days. The parking tax rate due applies as  described above for the given day the  sporting event takes place either on a  weekday (20%) or weekend (18%).      Since these charges are paid in advance  and the time and date of the event are                                                                                           defined, the start time and date dictate  whether the 20% or 18% rate applies.      Non-defined Event    A customer purchases bulk validation  tickets or coupons for future use where  date of use cannot be determined. For  example, a law firm that buys numerous  validation tickets to give to clients  throughout a month or year, or downtown  residents who buy multiple coupons for  guest parking:    The operator selling the “bulk validation  tickets or coupons” should sell both  weekday and weekend tickets which users  can redeem on the applicable day.    The 18% weekend rate will apply to the  weekend tickets, and the 20% weekday  rate will apply to the weekday tickets.      Annual Tax Returns     Every Operator is required to file an  annual tax return with the Department.   Such return shall include a separate site  schedule for each individual lot, garage or  site operated by the Operator.  Returns  shall include Gross Revenues and Parker  counts by category as well as authorized  deductions by site.      An Annual tax return is required for every  lot or garage operated, regardless is tax is  due or not.  A detailed accounting of all  revenues and deductions must be made  annually.       Valet Operators    The 15% “safe harbor” that had  previously been allowed will no longer be  permitted effective July 1, 2013.      Valet Parking Operators are now expected  to collect and remit Parking tax using the  18% and 20% rates outlined in 4-236-020  and include all revenues received on Line 1  of the annual return.  Any revenues  received where the vehicle is parked on the  street should be deducted on line 2(e) of  the tax return.  Operators are required to  maintain documentation to verify the  deductibility of those revenues.           Furthermore, if a Valet Operator parks the  vehicle in a lot or garage and remits the tax  directly to that operator they should deduct  the collected revenues on line 2 (e) of their  annual return and maintain documentation  to support the deduction because tax has  been paid to another Operator.

This bulletin discusses  certain issues pertaining to the tax and  what tax rate applies to specific  situations.     General Information     The tax is imposed on the use and  privilege of parking a motor vehicle in  or upon any parking lot or garage in  the City of Chicago. The ultimate  incidence of and liability for payment  of the tax is on the parking recipient.      Amendments to the Parking Tax     On November 2, 2011, the City  Council passed amendments which are  effective January 1, 2012. The  amendments include the following  changes to the daily, weekly and  monthly rates (with the old rates  stricken and the new rates  underscored):     (ii)  chapter for the privilege of parking for  a 24-hour period or less shall be $1.00,  if the charge or fee is greater than  $2.00 but less than $5.00; $1.75, if the  charge or fee is $5.00 or more but less  than $12.00; and $3.00, if the charge  or fee is $12.00 or more and paid on a  Saturday or Sunday; and $5.00, if the  charge or fee is $12.00 or more and  paid on a Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.       The tax imposed by this         The tax imposed by this     The tax imposed by this   (iii)  chapter for the privilege of parking on  a weekly basis shall be $5.00 if the  charge or fee is greater than $10.00  but less than $25.00; $8.75, if the  charge or fee is $25.00 or more but  less than $60.00; and $15.00 $25.00,  if the charge or fee is $60.00 or more.    (iv)  chapter for the privilege of parking on  a monthly basis shall be $20.00 if the  charge or fee is greater than $40.00  but less than $100.00; $35.00, if the  charge or fee is $100.00 or more but  less than $240.00; and $60.00 $90.00  if the charge or fee is $240.00 or more  but less than $300.00; $110.00 if the  charge or fee is $300.00 or more but  less than $400.00; and $120.00 if the  charge or fee is $400.00 or more.    Clarification of the  application of the new daily  parking tax rates to specific  situations    Weekday/Weekend overlap    Where a taxable period of 24 hours or  less starts on a weekday and ends on a  weekend, the weekend rate of $3 will  apply to that entire period.   Conversely, where a taxable period of  24 hours or less starts on a weekend  and ends on a weekday, the weekday  rate of $5 will apply to that entire  period.     In the situations noted above the tax  rate that applies depends on when the  parking charge is paid.  These  situations assume the charge is paid  when the customer leaves the parking  facility.  Generally the tax is  calculated when the payment is made.   Monday through Friday the $5.00 rate   applies. On Saturday and Sunday the  $3.00 rate applies.    Where a taxable period of 24 hours or  less starts and ends on a weekend, the  weekend rate of $3 will apply to that  entire period.  Conversely, where a  taxable period of 24 hours or less  starts and ends on a weekday, the  weekday rate of $5 will apply to that  entire period.     Example #1    A customer parks in a garage at 8:00  a.m. on Friday and leaves at 8:00 a.m.  on Saturday.  The tax due for that  period is $3.00.    Example #2    A customer parks in a garage at 8:00  a.m. on Sunday and leaves at 8:00  a.m. on Monday.  The tax due is  $5.00.    Example #3    A customer parks at an airport lot or  garage at 10:00 a.m. on Monday and  leaves at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday.  The  $5.00 tax applies to each of the 24  hour periods starting at 10:00 a.m. on  Monday, 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday,  10:00 a.m. on Wednesday, and 10:00  a.m. on Thursday, with $3.00 tax due  for the period of 10:00 a.m. Friday to  10:00 a.m. Saturday.  If the customer  instead leaves at a later time on  Saturday, the weekend rates apply to  any taxable charges for the additional  time.                                                                                                                    The operator selling the bulk  validation tickets or coupons should  either:  (1) sell separate weekday and  weekend tickets, in which case the $5  weekday rate will apply to the  weekday tickets, and the $3 weekend  rate will apply to the weekend tickets;  or (2) sell one form of ticket, which  may be used any day of the week  (weekday or weekend), in which case  the $5 weekday rate should be applied  to all of the tickets.

A  $3.00 tax is due for the period of 10:00  a.m. Saturday to 10:00 a.m. Sunday,  and a $5.00 tax is due for the period of  10:00 a.m. Sunday to 10:00 a.m.  Monday. If the customer instead leaves  at a later time on Monday, the  weekday rates apply to any taxable  charges for the additional time.    Example #5    A hotel guest stays overnight at the  hotel for Saturday night and Sunday  night, and departs on Monday  morning.  The hotel charges its  overnight guests for parking based on  the night of stay.  A $3.00 tax is due  for Saturday night, and a $3.00 tax is  due for Sunday night.    Example #6    A hotel guest stays overnight at the  hotel for Friday night and Saturday  night, and departs on Sunday morning.   The hotel charges its overnight guests  for parking based on the night of stay.   A $5.00 tax is due for Friday night,  and a $3.00 tax is due for Saturday  night.    Advance Purchase Situations    Defined Event    A customer pre-purchases a book of  passes for a sports team’s home games  where parking passes are on pre- defined game days. The dates of the  events are known in advance, and  those dates dictate whether the $5  weekday rate or the $3 weekend rate  applies.      Non-defined Event    A customer purchases bulk validation  tickets or coupons for future use where  date of use cannot be determined. For  example, a law firm that buys  numerous validation tickets to give to  clients throughout a month or year, or  downtown residents who buy multiple  coupons for guest parking:

This is the  first Information Bulletin issued to parking operators.   General Information  The parking tax is imposed on the use and privilege of parking a motor vehicle in or upon any  parking lot or garage in the City of Chicago. The ultimate incidence of and liability for payment  of this tax is on the parking recipient. It shall be the duty of every operator of a parking lot or  garage to secure the tax from each recipient and to remit the tax to the Department of Revenue.  The municipal code reference for this tax is Chapter 4-236.   Amendments to the Parking Tax  On November 17, 1999 , the City Council passed amendments to the parking tax which are  effective March 1, 2000. The amendments include:    •  A Tax Rate Increase     Except as noted below, the parking tax rate has been increased from $1.50 to $2.00 for  each motor vehicle parked in a lot or garage for every 24-hour period or fraction thereof.  The rate of tax has been increased from $7.50 to $10.00 if the charge for parking is made  on a weekly basis and from $30.00 to $40.00 if the charge for parking is on a monthly  basis.     •  Limited Reduced Tax Rates     The parking tax has been reduced under certain circumstances. If the charge for parking a  motor vehicle for a 24-hour period or fraction thereof is greater than $2.00 but less than  $5.00, the parking tax will be 75 cents. If the charge for parking a motor vehicle on a  weekly basis is greater than $10.00 but less than $25.00, the parking tax will be $3.75. If  the charge for parking a motor vehicle on a monthly basis is greater than $50.00 but less  than $100.00, the tax will be $15.00.     •  Limited Tax -Free Parking     The tax shall not be imposed on parking privileges where the charge or fee does not  exceed $2.00 for a 24-hour period or fraction thereof, or $10.00 for a weekly period or  $40.00 for a monthly period.     In summary, where an operator charges different parking rates based on the day of week  or length of time that a motor vehicle is parked, the applicable tax rate for the parking  privilege shall be determined by the actual amount charged for that motor vehicle.    It should be noted that the full tax rate will apply to all parking privileges in cases where  an operator fails to keep accurate and complete books and records evidencing that the  reduced rate or no tax applies.     •  New Collector's Commission   •     For the period February 1, 1997 to July 31, 1997, operators may retain a total of one  percent of the parking tax they collect to reimburse themselves for expenses incurred in  connection with collecting, accounting for and remitting the tax, and with implementing  the parking tax changes set forth in the recent amendments to the parking ordinance.    This commission shall not be allowed for taxes not timely remitted to the Department of  Revenue or for periods during which an operator is not in compliance with the ticket, tag  or receipt requirements contained in Chapter 4-236 of the municipal code of Chicago.    Issuance of Receipts    An additional requirement has been added to the parking tax. Operators will now be  required to issue receipts to daily parkers showing the amount of the parking charge and  the amount of the parking tax paid.    Unless a cash register is used which produces a daily summary tape showing the number  of motor vehicles parked, the total charges paid and the amount of tax collected for each  tier of parking taxes, and unless the tapes are maintained as required, the receipt shall be  in the form of a two-part numerical receipt.     Operators required to issue two-part receipts shall retain one part and issue one part to the  recipient. Each part shall show the parking charge and the amount of tax paid.    Operators who fail to issue receipts in the form or manner provided for in the parking tax  ordinance shall be subject to fines of not less than $50.00 nor more than $200.00 for each  motor vehicle parked for which no conforming receipt is issued to the patron.     •  Additional Record-Keeping Requirements     Section 4-236-050 outlines an operator's duty to keep accurate and complete books and  records to which the Director of Revenue shall at all times have full access.     A requirement to maintain all cash register and other receipts and all cash register tapes  was added in the recent amendments.    In addition, the daily sheets required to be maintained must now be kept separate for each   •   •   the number of motor vehicles parked in or on each lot or garage, segregated on a  daily, weekly, monthly or other basis and further segregated by the amount of the  charge or fee imposed for parking.    the actual parking tax receipts collected from all transactions.     •  Additional Reporting Requirement   location. These daily sheets are to include:       Operators will now also be required to report their monthly parking receipts, net of tax  collected, and the number of non-taxable parkers on their returns    Rights to Appeal to the Director of Revenue for Alternative Record- Keeping  Requirements  The amendments related to record keeping and issuance of receipts were added to ensure a  sufficient audit trail exists should an operator be selected for audit or come under investigation. It  is possible an operator may have systems, controls and audit trails in place presently that vary  from these requirements but are acceptable to the Department of Revenue.    If an operator feels this is the case, an application may be submitted to the Director outlining  systems, controls and the audit trail of documents.   All applications should detail the nature of the operation ( ie. garage, parking lot operated at a  fixed location throughout the year, parking lot operated on an event basis, honor lot, etc.) for  which the application is made and include sufficient explanation of proposed alternatives. Copies  of related business documents and records should be attached to the application where possible.   You should also be aware of the fact that the parking tax ordinance includes a provision wherein  operators, on an annual basis, may request approval from the Director of Revenue to discard  tickets and tags that were issued more than one year earlier. The Director shall grant such  approval if he or she determines that the operator's books and records satisfy the record-keeping  requirements of the parking tax ordinance.   All applications should be sent to the address below:    Chicago Department of Revenue  Audit Division  DePaul Center   333 S. State, Suite 300  Chicago, IL 60604-3977  Attn: Charles E.

Pursuant to section 3-32-030(A) of the Chicago Municipal Code (“Code”),  a tax is imposed upon (1) the lease or rental in the City of personal property, or (2) the  privilege of using in the City personal property that is leased or rented outside the City.     A  taxable  lease  or  rental  of  personal  property  takes  place  (a)  when  an  agreement  or  contract is signed or otherwise entered into by the parties in Chicago and the delivery or  use of the object of the agreement also takes place in Chicago, or (b) when 50% or more  of the use of the object of the agreement between the parties occurs or will occur within  the City of Chicago.  If delivery occurs within the City it shall be presumed that 50% or  more of the use will occur in the City, unless proved otherwise.    Section 2.     Application of this section is illustrated by the following:   When  a  lease  is  signed  and  the  delivery  of  the  property  takes  place  in   a.  Chicago, the transaction is subject to tax.               b.  When  a  lease  is  signed  and  the  delivery  occurs  in  Chicago,  but  the  property is returned to the lessor at termination of the lease outside of Chicago,  the transaction is subject to tax.   When a lease is signed in Chicago and the delivery and entire use takes   c.  place outside of Chicago, the transaction is not subject to tax.   d.  When  delivery  or  use  of  leased  property  takes  place  in  Chicago,  the  transaction is taxable unless it is proved that the agreement was not entered into  within the City and that 50% or more of the use did not occur within the City.   e.  When a lease is signed outside of Chicago, and the property is delivered  and used outside of Chicago with  in termittent use (less than 50%) in Chicago the  transaction is not subject to tax.   The 50%-or-more-of-use requirement  applies only  if the agreement was      Section 3.  entered into outside the City.  Furthermore, if a separate payment is required for each  period of rental or lease time, the 50%-or-more-of-use requirement shall apply to the use  within the payment period.  If rental or lease payments are determined by usage of the   object, then 50%-or-more-of-use refers to the usage within the City as compared to the  usage outside of the City for the payment period. A“payment period” is any period of  time for which a payment is required for the use of the rented or leased property.

The    tax    does  not  apply  to  leases  of  personal  property  by    any  corporation,  society,  association,  foundation,  or  institution  organized  and  operated  exclusively    for  charitable, educational or religious purposes.  See Code Section 3-32-040(B).  However,  the exemption for  such lessees does not apply to all not-for-profit organizations.         Advice  has  been  requested  concerning  the  application  of  the    tax  to  leases  of   For Example:   A  church  leases  a  copier  for  use  in  its  exempt  activity.    The  tax  is  not   1.  applicable.   2.  A  university  leases  a  computer  for  curriculum  and  general  university  purposes but also sublets computer time to a service bureau.  The tax is applicable  to the sublease.   3.  A not-for-profit athletic club operated for the exclusive use of its members  leases  certain  typewriters.    The  tax  is  applicable,  as  the  club’s  activity  is  not  charitable,  educational or religious.            4.  A  fraternal  organization  operating  for  the  purpose  of  social  activities  limited  to  members    is  not  exempt  from  the  tax  as  it  is  not  a  charitable  organization. However, a home for aged and destitute members may qualify as an  exempt charitable organization.     The lessor has the responsibility to determine whether an organization is exempt       from the  lease tax.  The lessor may rely upon a lessee’s proof of exemption from the  State of Illinois Retailers’ Occupation Tax,  along with the lessee’s representation that the     The principles set forth in the State of Illinois Retailers’ Occupation Tax Rules   leased property will be used in connection with an exempt activity.  The lessee will be  required to provide the lessor with necessary documentary support for the exemption or  be subject to the tax.      and Regulations as to charitable, educational and religious organizations will be  applicable to such exemptions from the Chicago lease tax; however, the Chicago Director  of Revenue reserves the right to issue specific rulings or make specific determinations in  each individual case, if required, for administration of the tax.

Pursuant to section 3-32-030(A) of the Chicago Municipal Code (“Code”),  the  Chicago  Personal  Property  Lease  Transaction  Tax  (the  “lease  tax”  or  “tax”)  is  imposed upon (1) the lease or rental in the City of personal property, or (2) the privilege  of using in the City personal property that is leased or rented outside the City.  Section 3- 32-030(A)  does  not  limit  the  application  of  the  tax  to  any  specific  types  of  personal  property.  Therefore, unless expressly exempted, the tax applies to the lease or rental of  any type of personal property.    Section 2.  Under  Section  3-32-030(A),  the  lease  or  rental  of  personal  property  includes  lease  time  on  personal  property  not  itself  rented,  such  as  usage  time  on  a  computer,  data  processing  equipment,  copying  machines,  etc.    Therefore,  the  use  of  a  computer for a fee by a computer operator/lessee is subject to tax even though physical  possession  of  the  computer  does  not  transfer  to  the  lessee.    Likewise,  the  rental  of  or  usage time on the computer software is also subject to tax.    Section 3.  A  lease  or  rental  of  personal  property  occurs  under  the  ordinance  when  there  is  a  transfer  of  the  possession  or  use  of  personal  property  or  the  right  to  the  possession  or  use  of  personal  property,  but  not  the  title  or  ownership  thereof,  for  a  valuable consideration.    Section 4.  The  lease tax is calculated on the lease or rental price.  Lease or rental  price means consideration paid for the lease or rental of personal property, but excluding  any  separately-stated  charges  not  for  the  use  of  personal  property.   See  also  Section  5  below.  A primary factor in determining whether a separately-stated charge is for the use  of personal property is whether or not the charge is optional.    Section 5.  For    contracts  which  involve  both  a  sale  of  a  service  and  a  lease  of  personal property, the lessor shall be required to separate the lease or rental portion from  the sale portion, as provided in Section 4 above.  If  the lessor fails to separate the lease  or rental portion of the price  from the non-lease or non-rental portion, the entire price  charged shall be deemed taxable, unless it is clearly proven that at least 50% of the price  is  not  for  the  use  of  any  personal  property.    If  this  occurs,  then  the  portion  not  representing the use of personal property would be non-taxable.  Neither Section 4 nor   A transaction involving the transfer of the possession or use of personal   this  section  is  intended  to  allow  a  lessor  to  treat  normal  overhead  costs,  such  as  maintenance, as non-taxable sales of services unless the lease agreement clearly indicates  that these costs are being charged separately to the lessee and are optional.    Section 6.  property shall be taxable even though only a small portion of the transaction involves the  transfer of the possession or use of such property.  However, the amount subject to tax  shall be determined as provided in this ruling.  If the transfer of personal property is  incidental to the service provided, in that the use of the personal property has little or no  value without the accompanying service and the cost of the personal property is de  minimis  (i.e., nominal) compared to the price charged for the total transaction, then no  lease or rental shall be deemed to have occurred, and no portion of the price shall be  taxable.  Furthermore, if the lessor or lessor’s agent furnishes the services of operating   equipment for a lessee, so that only the lessor or lessor’s agent uses the equipment, and so  that the lessor or lessor’s agent remains both in total possession and in total control of the  equipment, then no lease or rental shall be deemed to have occurred, and no portion of  the price shall be taxable.  However, a person who operates a terminal to use a computer  is considered the user of that computer, and such use is subject to the tax, even though the  physical possession of the computer remains in the hands of the computer owner; and in  such a case the location of the terminal used by the operator shall be deemed the location  of the use of the computer by such operator for purposes of the tax.

Code Section 3-32-020(H) defines a lease or rental as including leased time on or  for the use of equipment such as calculators, computers and copiers.  Therefore, even if  the possession of the equipment does not transfer, if a usage charge is made for the use of  the equipment, this charge is generally subject to tax.  (But see exceptions discussed in  Chicago  Personal  Property  Lease  Transaction  Tax  Ruling  #3.).    For  time-sharing  of  computers and computer software see Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax  Ruling #5.    Examples of the above include:     •  The use of a computer, where possession of the computer does not transfer to the  user but where a charge is made for the period or amount of usage by the user.   (But  see  exceptions  discussed  in  Chicago  Personal  Property  Lease  Transaction  Tax Ruling #3.).            CITY OF CHICAGO   DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE   PERSONAL PROPERTY LEASE TRANSACTION TAX RULING   •  The use of an addressing machine, where the possession of the machine does not  transfer  but  where  a  charge  is  made  for  the  number  of  addresses  done  or  the  period of use by the user.  (Note: Where the operator retains exclusive control and  possession of the addressing machine and for a given transaction the machine is  used  solely  by  the  operator  to  provide  a  service  to  the  purchaser,  this  is  not  taxable  under  the    lease  tax  (see  Chicago  Personal  Property  Lease  Transaction  Tax Ruling #3) but may be taxable to an extent under the Home Rule Municipal  Retailer’s  Occupation  Tax  (MROT)  (Code  Section  3-40-010),  which  is  administered by the Illinois Department of Revenue (IDOR).   •  The  use  of  a  copying  machine,  where  the  possession  of  the  machine  does  not  transfer but where a charge is made per copy or for time used by the user.  This  does not apply, however, for coin operated machines, which are exempt.  (Note:   The  transfer  of  paper,  ink  and  other  property  through  the  use  of  the  copying      machine  is  already  taxable  under  the  MROT;  therefore,  their  cost  price  is  excluded from the taxable charge subject to the  lease tax.)  See also, exceptions  discussed in Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax Ruling #3.   •  The use of a clothes washing or car washing machine, where the possession of the  machine does not transfer but where a charge is made for the period of use of the  machine by the user.  This does not apply, however, for coin operated machines,  which are exempt.  Automatic car washing machines operated and controlled by  the owner or manager of such machines, where the customers only drive their  automobiles into and out of such machines, are not subject to this tax.

Pursuant to section 3-32-030(A) of the Chicago Municipal Code (“Code”),  the  Chicago  Personal  Property  Lease  Transaction  Tax  (the  “lease  tax”  or  “tax”)  is  imposed upon (1) the lease or rental in the City of personal property, or (2) the privilege  of using in the City personal property that is leased or rented outside the City.  Section 3- 32-020(O) defines personal property as including all property other than real property.   The tax, therefore, applies to the lease or rental of audio and/or visual tapes, as well as,  the lease or rental of hardware-type equipment (i.e., VCR’s, TV’s, etc.).  Hence, the lease  or rental price of such personal property is subject to the  lease tax.     Section 2.  Late,  membership  and  club  fees  are  also  taxable  under  Section  3-32- 030(A) except when it is demonstrated that such fees are not part of the consideration for  the lease or rental of personal property.  For example:     A.  In addition to the agreed lease or rental price, a late fee of $2.00 per day is  charged, when the video tape leased or rented is not return when due.  Such late  fee is subject to the  lease tax because it represents compensation for the extended  lease or rental of the personal property.   B.  A fee is charged to become a member of a particular group/club wherein  the  benefits  to  be  derived  from  membership  include  the  ability  to  lease  or  rent  video tapes for free, at a discount, or in advance of others.  Such membership/club  fees  are  taxable  because  they  represent  payments  which  are  part  of  the  consideration for the lease or rental of personal property.  Part of this fee might be  excluded from tax, however, if it is clearly shown that benefits unrelated to the  lease or rental of the tapes are provided for part of the fee.     Section 3.  When audio or video tapes are offered by a video rental store for lease or  rental, even though at a later date they are subsequently sold, the lease or rental of such  personal property, prior to such sale, is subject to the  lease tax.  It should be noted that  withdrawal of tapes from the lease or rental market for purpose of retail sale converts  such property to sales property, and as such, any subsequent sale is taxable under the   Home Rule Municipal Retailer’s Occupation Tax (MROT) (Code Section 3-40-010),  which is administered by the Illinois Department of Revenue (IDOR), at the sales price.

Application of the Tax.   A.  Where possession of the computer is not transferred, use of a computer is  deemed  to  occur  at  the  location  of  the  access  device  used  to  access  the  computer.   Therefore,  if  the  user’s  access  device  is  located  in  the  City  of  Chicago,  the    lease  tax  applies  to  all  charges  for  the  use  of  the  computer  and  its  software  including,  but  not  limited to, the running or execution of computer programs, or the access, input, retrieval  or modification of data or information which are accessed by the user from such device.     Pursuant  to  section  3-32-030(A)  of  the  Chicago  Municipal  Code  (“Code”),  the  Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax (the “lease tax” or “tax”) is imposed  upon (1) the lease or rental in the City of personal property, or (2) the privilege of using  in the City personal property that is leased or rented outside the City.     In particular, the tax applies to leased time for use of equipment or other personal  property  not  otherwise  itself  rented,  including  but  not  limited  to  computers,  computer  software and data processing equipment.  Code § 3-32-020.  The tax on leased time for  use of equipment or other personal property is not limited to time-based charges but also  applies to usage-based charges for the use of equipment or other personal property not  otherwise itself rented.  See Meites v. City of Chicago, 184 Ill. App. 3d 887, 540 N.E. 2d  973 (1st Dist. 1989); also see Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax Ruling  #4.     Section 2. Computer Users   The lease or rental of any personal property specifically includes time-sharing and  time or other use of a computer with other users, whether or not denominated as such. In  these  so-called  multi-user  computer  systems,  possession  of  the  computer  is  neither  transferred nor intended to be transferred.  The owner or operator of the computer permits  use  of  the  computer  through  a  terminal  or  other  device  (“access  device”)  at  the  user’s  location for a fee.     Section 3. Computer Use         B.  Unless  charges  for  the  use  of  the  computer  include  charges  for  services  performed by the computer-provider’s personnel at the time of the transaction, the  transaction is considered to involve charges solely for the use of personal property  and  not  for  the  sale  of  a  service.    See  Chicago  Personal  Property  Lease  Transaction  Tax  Ruling  #3.    Thus,  charges  imposed  on  the  user  for  the  user’s  access to, or retrieval of information from, a computer or its database is charges  for use of personal property and not charges for sale of a service.  See Meites,  supra,184 Ill. App. 3d at 895, 540 N. E. 2d at 979 (provision of a database which  users may use is not provision of a service).    C.  “computer”  to  telecommunications devices connected to computers.   As  used  in  this  ruling  and  for  purposes  of  applying  the  tax,  the  word  and   includes  but   is  not   limited   auxiliary   storage     EXAMPLE        Application of this ruling is illustrated by the following example.   ABC  is  a  consumer  credit  reporting  company  which  maintains  a  computerized  data base of consumer credit information which it regularly updates.  Customers of ABC  may elect to access ABC’s data base via computer terminal or other device to request and  retrieve credit reports.  When a user makes such a request, ABC’s response to the request  occurs without the performance of any service on the part of ABC’s personnel relating  specifically to the user’s request.    If  the  customer’s  terminal  or  other  device  used  to  access  ABC’s  computer  is    located  in  the  City,  then  the  transaction  is  subject  to  tax  because  the  request  for  and  retrieval of the credit report is the use by the customer of ABC’s computer and data base  and is taxable lease or rental of personal property for purposes of the Chicago Personal  Property Lease Transaction Tax Ordinance.      or rental price for the use of ABC’ s personal property.  The customer’s use from a  location within the City is taxable regardless of the fact that the computer also is used by  ABC to maintain its database, or for other purposes, and regardless of the location of  ABC ’s computer.     The price charged by ABC for credit reports obtained in this manner is the lease

In the case of a lease or rental of personal property meeting all of the conditions     C.  of paragraph B of this section, no lease or rental between or among members of the  affiliated corporate group shall be deemed to have occurred; rather, the property shall be  deemed to have been acquired on behalf of the entire affiliated corporate group as a  single entity and the lease or rental price charged between or among the members shall be  deemed merely cost or expense allocations and not charges for the lease or rental of  personal property.

This ruling concerns vehicle rentals to Chicago residents, on  or after July 1, 2011, from suburban locations within 3 miles of Chicago's border, excluding that  portion ofthe City's border composed ofthe boundaries ofO'Hare International Airport (""O'Hare""),  by motor vehicle rental companies doing business in the City.  See Sections 3 and 4 below.  The  ruling applies only to short-term rentals, as distinguished from long-term leases, which are discussed  in Personal Property Lease  Transaction Tax Ruling  #8.  The ruling  does not  affect the  audit or  assessment ofany rental locations in the City.  The ruling also does not affect the audit or assessment  of any rentals in which passengers who arrive at or depart from a City airport are transported by the  motor vehicle  rental  company or  its  agents  for the  purpose  of picking up  or returning  a  rented  vehicle.   Section 2.  Chicago Municipal Code (""Code"") Chapter 3-32, provides as follows:   BacklITound.  The  Chicago  Personal  Property Lease  Transaction Tax Ordinance,   a.  The tax.  Code Section 3-32-030(A) imposes a tax on ""(1) the lease or rental in the  city of personal property,  or (2)  the privilege of using in the city personal property that is  leased or rented outside the city.""   Use.  The term ""use"" means ""the exercise of any right to  or power over personal  b.  property by a lessee incident to the lease or rental ofthat property including, but not limited  to, the permanent or temporary storage, stationing or garaging of personal property by the  lessee.""  Code Section 3-32-020(R).   c.  Exemption for use primarily outside the City.  There is an exemption for ""[t]he use  in the city of personal property leased or rented outside the city ifthe property is primarily  used (more than 50 percent) outside the city.""  Code Section 3-32-050(A)(I).  As with other  exemptions, the burden is on the taxpayer or tax collector to prove, with written evidence,  that the taxpayer or tax collector is entitled to this exemption.  See,~,  Code Sections 3-4­ 130,3-4-340; Telco Leasing, Inc. v.  Allphin, 63  Ill. 2d 305  (1976); West Belmont, L.L.c.  v.  City of Chicago, 349 Ill. App.  3d 46 (I st Dist. 2004).   d.  Collection.  The lessor is responsible for collecting the tax from the lessee at the time  of each lease or rental payment,  and for remitting the tax to the Department of Revenue  (""Department"").  Lessors that fail  to  collect or remit the tax are liable to the City for the  amount of such tax, plus interest and penalties.  Code Section 3-32-070.   e.  Books and records.  Every lessor is required to retain for at least five years accurate  books and records ofeach transaction or activity requiring the lessor to collect and remit the  tax.  Code Section 3-32-110.  Such books and records include original source documents and  books of entry denoting the transactions that gave rise, or may have given rise, to any tax  liability, exemption, or deduction.  Code Section 3-4-170.   f.  Rules  and  regulations.  The  Director  of the  Department  is  authorized  to  adopt,  promulgate  and  enforce  rules  and  regulations  pertaining  to  the  administration  and  enforcement of the lease tax.  Code Section 3-32-120.   Record keeping.  In light of the  above, each motor vehicle rental company doing  Section 3.  business in the City is advised, when renting from a suburban location within 3 miles ofthe City's  border (excluding the borders of O'Hare), to a customer who will use the vehicle in the City, to  maintain written records that support any claim of exemption from the tax, for the company's use  in the event of an audit.   In the  event of an audit, absent written proof to  the contrary, the Department will assume that a  customer who is a Chicago resident (according to the customer's driver's license), whenrenting from  such a location, will use the vehicle in the City; and the Departm~nt will assume that a customer who  is not a Chicago resident (according to the customer's driver's license), when renting from such a  location, will not use the vehicle in the City.   The Department deems the following provisions to be acceptable to support the exemption for use  primarily outside the  City,  if  made part of a company's rental  agreement or related books  and  records kept in connection with such rentals to Chicago residents:   2   By initialing this space you are notifYing us that you plan to use this vehicle  50% or more of the time (including garaging) in the City of Chicago.   By initialing this space you are notifYing us that you plan to use this vehicle  more than 50% ofthe time (including garaging) outside the City ofChicago.   For purposes of this ruling, the term ""doing business"" in the City includes, for example, having a  location in the City or regularly renting vehicles that are used in the City, such that the company is  subject to audit by the Department under state and federal law.  Any company that is not sure if its  operations constitute ""doing business"" in the City may contact the Department for an opinion.   Section 4.  Three Mile Limit. As a policy matter, the Department has decided that, absent further  notice (as set forth below), it will not audit or assess any motor vehicle rental companies for rentals  from locations more than three (3) miles outside Chicago's border,  excluding that portion of the  City's border composed of the boundaries of O'Hare.  If the Department decides to change this  policy, it will provide at least 120 days' advance written notice, and the change will be prospective  only.  Any company that is not sure if anyone of its locations is more than three (3) miles outside  Chicago's border (excluding the.borders ofO'Hare) may contact the Department for a determination  of that issue.   Section 5.  Safe Harbor.  In lieu ofmaintaining the kind ofwritten records referred to in Section  3 above, a motor vehicle rental company with suburban locations within three (3) miles ofChicago' s  border (excluding the borders of0 'Hare) may, as a safe harbor, assume that 25% ofits rental charges  at such locations, to customers who are Chicago residents, are for vehicles that will be used primarily  in Chicago.  Thus, a motor vehicle rental company may pay tax to the Department in an amount  equal to the tax rate multiplied by 25% ofits rental charges at such locations, to customers who are  Chicago residents.   Section 6.  Status ofPrior Rulings and Bulletin.  This ruling supercedes Personal Property Lease  Transaction Tax Amended Ruling #11 (effectiveJuly IS, 2009), Personal Property Lease Transaction  Tax Ruling #11  (effective July 1,2008), and also those portions ofthe September 1997 Information  Bulletin,  entitled  ""Wheel  Tax License,"" which concerned the  application of the  City's personal  property lease tax to car rentals outside Chicago.  The Department will treat those rulings and the  described portions ofthe Information Bulletin as null and void, and will not seek to enforce them.   3    "

Background  The Lease Tax Ordinance, chapter 3-32 of  the Municipal Code of Chicago (“Code”),  imposes a Tax on the lease or rental in the  city of personal property.  As of the date of  this Informational Bulletin, the rate of the  Tax is 9% of the lease or rental price.  The  incidence of the Tax and the obligation to  pay the Tax are upon the lessee of the  personal property, but the lessor is  responsible for collecting it. See Code  Sections 3-32-030 and 3-32-070. It is the  duty of each lessor to collect the Tax from  the lessee at the time of each lease or  rental payment, and to remit the Tax to the  Chicago Department of Finance  (“Department”).  Id.    Application of the Lease Tax to  cell tower leases  In general, for agreements that involve both  a lease of personal property and the lease of  real property, or the sale of a service, the  lessor is required to separate the taxable  lease or rental portion from the nontaxable  portion. If the lessor fails to separate the  lease or rental portion of the price charged  from the non-taxable portion, the entire  price charged shall be deemed taxable,  unless it is clearly proven that at least 50%  of the price is not for the use of any  personal property. If this occurs, then the  portion not representing the use of personal  property would be non-taxable. See  Department Lease Tax Ruling #7, Section  5.    Safe Harbor for computation of  Lease Tax on cell tower leases  Because the lease or rental of space on cell  towers generally involves not only the lease  of personal property but also the lease of  real property, and possibly the sale of a   service, the Department offers a safe harbor  for collection and remittance (by a lessor) or  for payment (by a lessee). Specifically, the  Department will not assess additional taxes    DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE   INFORMATIONAL BULLETIN   Lease Tax on Cell Towers     Additional Questions?  Additional tax information and forms can  be found at:  www.cityofchicago.org/finance.     You may also contact us by email at:  taxpolicy@cityofchicago.org or by phone  at 312-747-4747.          on cell tower lessors who timely remit the  Tax based on 40% of the total consideration  charged for the lease or rental of space on  their cell towers. The purpose of the safe  harbor is to promote administrative  convenience and avoid disputes.    Example: A lessor charges its  customer $1,000 per month for  the lease or rental of space on its  cell tower, the use of its real  property and the provision of  certain services. The lessor may  compute the Lease Tax due using  the safe harbor as follows:      $1000 charge x 40% safe harbor  rate = $400 taxable amount  $400 taxable amount x 9% tax  rate = $36.00 Lease Tax due per  month    Lessors who choose not to rely on this  40% safe harbor rate must report 100% of  lease or rental charges and then deduct all  non-lease charges to compute the taxable  amount. If upon audit the Department  determines that the non-lease charges were  overstated, additional Tax due will be  assessed, along with applicable interest  and penalties.    Payment and filing requirements  for cell tower lessors  For all periods beginning after February 1,  2016, all lessors are required to collect and  remit the Lease Tax and file applicable  returns pursuant to the Uniform Revenue  Procedures Ordinance, chapter 3-4 of the  Code, on all transactions involving the lease  or rental of space on cell towers.    Accordingly, lessors must remit the Lease  Tax to the Department on the 15th day of the  month following collection of the Tax and  file an annual return on the 15th day of  August following the end of the fiscal year,  which ends on June 30. This may require a   lessor to register with the Department for  payment of the Lease Tax.

Separate permits are required for each exterior and interior advertising display.    The fee for the issuance of any interior or exterior display permit shall be $100.00 for each display, payable at the time of application.  This fee shall be in addition to the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax that applies to lease or rental payments pursuant to chapter 3-32 of the municipal code.

In addition, permits cannot be transferred or assigned.    What is the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax?  The Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax is a tax imposed on the lease or rental of personal property in the City of Chicago.  More specifically, per chapter 3-32-030 (A): Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a tax is imposed upon: (1) the lease or rental in the city of personal property, or (2) the privilege of using in the city personal property that is leased or rented outside the city. The incidence of the tax and the obligation to pay the tax are upon the lessee of the personal property.  What is the tax rate?  Per chapter 3-32-030 (B)     The rate of the tax shall be six percent of the lease or rental price. The tax shall be paid by the lessee at the time of each lease or rental payment, and each tax payment shall be determined by applying the tax rate to the lease or rental payment.  What is the responsibility of the lessor?  Per chapter 3-32-070 of the municipal code: It shall be the duty of each lessor to collect the tax imposed by this chapter from the lessee at the time of each lease or rental payment, and to remit the tax to the department in accordance with Section 3-32-080 of this chapter. In the event that a lessor fails to collect or remit the tax required to be collected by this section, the lessor shall be liable to the city for the amount of such tax.   Is there a commission granted for lessors who collect the tax?  Yes, the lessor is allowed a commission of 1% of the tax collected and timely remitted to the Department.  To be considered timely, the remittance and return must be physically received or received in an envelope postmarked by the Unites States Postal Service on or before the due date.   What are the penalties for late payments?  Per chapter 3-4 of the Municipal Code, late payments incur interest at a rate of 12% per annum simple interest, calculated daily, based on a 365 day calendar year and a late penalty rate of 5% of the tax due.  How do I register for the Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax?    Please call 312-747-4747 (Customer Service) and you will be given instructions as to what steps to take in order to register for the tax.  Failing to register and pay the tax in a timely manner may result in interest as well as late and negligence penalties being applied to payments not made.  How often is the tax paid?

(References to sections of the Municipal Code of Chicago and related rulings are indicated in parenthesis.)  General Information  The Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax ordinance imposes a 6% tax on (1) the lease or rental in the city of personal property or (2) the privilege of using in the city personal property that is leased or rented outside the city.  The incidence of the tax and the obligation to pay the tax are upon the lessee of the personal property.   (3-32-030(A)).   How is the tax collected?  It is the duty of each lessor to collect the Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax from the lessee at the time of each lease or rental payment, and to remit the tax to the Department of Revenue.   In the event that a lessor fails to collect or remit the tax, the lessor shall be liable to the city for the amount of such tax.  (3-32-070(A)).   How does the Personal Property Lease Transaction   Tax apply to mail box leases?  In  general,  for  service  contracts  that involve both a sale of a service and a lease of personal property, the lessor is required to separate the lease or rental portion from the sale  portion. If such lessor  fails  to  separate  the  lease  or rental portion of the price charged from the non-lease or non-rental portion, the entire  price  charged  shall  be  deemed taxable, unless it is clearly proven that at least 50% of the price is not for the use  of  any  personal  property.  If  this occurs,  the  portion  not representing  the  use  of  personal property would be non-taxable. (Ruling #7, Section 5).    then   Because  the  lease  or  rental  of  mail boxes involves both a sale of service and  a  lease  of  personal  property,  the Department of Revenue has determined that approximately 25% of the charge is attributable to the rental portion and therefore,  subject  the  Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax.  The Department of Revenue will not assess additional  taxes  on  mail  box  lessors who timely remit the tax based on 25% of  the  consideration  charged  for  the lease or rental of mail boxes.    to   Example:  A  mail  box  Lessor  charges his  customer  $100  for  the  lease  or rental  of  a  mail  box.    The  lessor computes  the  tax  due  using  the  safe harbor rate as follows:  $100 charge * 25% safe harbor rate =  $25 taxable amount  $25 taxable amount * 6% tax rate =  $1.50 tax due     Lessors who choose not to rely on this 25% safe harbor rate must report 100% of  lease  or  rental  charges  and  then deduct  all  non-lease  charges  to compute the taxable amount.  If upon audit  the  Department  determines  that the non-lease charges were overstated, additional taxes due will be assessed, along  with  applicable  penalties  and interest.   What  are  the  payment  and filing  requirements  for  mail box lessors?  For all periods beginning after  August  31,  2003,  all  lessors  are required  to  collect  and  remit  the Personal  Property  Lease  Transaction Tax and file applicable returns pursuant to  the  Uniform  Revenue  Procedures Ordinance  (3-4)  on  all  transactions involving  the  lease  or  rental  of  mail boxes.    to  collect   Specifically, on or before the last day of  each  calendar  month,  every  lessor required  the  Personal Property Lease  Transaction Tax must remit the tax along with a remittance coupon    relating  to  the  tax  collected during the preceding calendar month. For example, the  September 2003 tax remittance is due on or before  October  31,  2003.    Each  lessor  is allowed  to  retain  1%  of  the  Personal Property  Lease  Transaction  Tax  it collects to reimburse itself for expenses incurred in connection with accounting for  and  remitting  the  tax  to  the Department of Revenue; provided that this service fee shall not be allowed for taxes  not  the Department. (3-32-070(A))  timely  remitted   to   In addition, a return must be filed with the Department on an annual basis on   Informational Bulletin  October 2003  report   returns  must   or  before  August  15  of  each  year.  Annual  tax liabilities  and  other  applicable information  for  the  12-month  period ending the immediately preceding June 30  (the  ""annual  tax  year"").  (3-4- 186(A))  With regard to the Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax due for the lease or rental of  mail boxes, the first  annual  tax  year  shall  cover September  1,  2003  through  June  30, 2004.    Thereafter,  the  tax  year  shall cover July 1 of a given  year through June 30 of the following year with the return due on or before August 15.    Questions?

20636`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxSupportingInformation/May1997InformationBulletinProperty.pdf`Success`Success`2`2`Not a fillable PDF.`"May 1997 Information Bulletin    Information Bulletin  Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax/Down Payments  and Trade-In Allowances   To: Registered Lessors  In April 1996 the Chicago Department of Revenue issued the Informational Bulletin, Volume 1  Number 1 addressing Common Lease Transaction Tax Issues for Vehicle Leasing Companies.  There was some confusion about the taxability of down payments and trade-in allowances. The  purpose of this informational bulletin is to further clarify the application of the Chicago Personal  Property Lease Transaction Tax to down payments and trade-in allowances on long term vehicle  leases.   General Information  The Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax ordinance imposes a 6% tax on (1) the  lease or rental in the city of personal property or (2) the privilege of using in the city personal  property that is leased or rented outside the city (3-32-030(A)).   Down payments and trade-in allowances are considered part of the ""lease price"" or ""rental price"";  therefore, under certain circumstances they are subject to the Chicago Personal Property Lease  Transaction Tax. The portion of a down payment or trade-in allowance which is taxable depends  on the number of months taxable under the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax.  The taxability of the monthly lease payment depends on where the lease transaction occurs and  where the vehicle is used.   Are down payments and trade-in allowances taxable if the vehicle is leased in  the city?  Yes, down payments and trade-in allowances are taxable for leases which are entered into in the  city. The portion of the down payment or trade-in allowance which is taxable depends on the  location of the use of the vehicle. If the vehicle is:    •  Used In the City   The tax would apply only to a fraction of the down payment and trade-in allowance. A  lease payment is not considered taxable for any rental period in which the vehicle is used  solely outside the city. However, the tax is due for the lease payment and for the portion  of the down payment and trade-in value for the period in which the lessee takes  possession or delivery of the vehicle at a location within the city.   Example: A customer leases a vehicle from a leasing company located in Chicago. The  lease has a 36-month lease term. The customer garages the vehicle in Oak Brook. The  customer made a down payment of $1,000 and had a trade-in with the value of $1,000.   The tax would apply to the entire amount of the down payment and trade-in allowance. In  the case of personal property such as a motor vehicle, the garaging, storing or keeping of  the property constitutes a use. To determine the location of a vehicle's use, lessors should  consult insurance documents which show where the vehicle is domiciled or garaged.  (Transaction Tax Ruling #12)    •  Used Outside the City   The first month of the lease would be considered taxable because the lessee took  possession of the vehicle at a location within the city; therefore, 1/36 (1 taxable monthly  lease payment out of a 36- month lease) of the down payment and 1/36 of the trade-in  value would be considered taxable. The taxable down payment and trade-in amount  would be $2,000 ($1,000 down payment + $1,000 trade-in value) * 1/36 = $55.55. The  tax due on the down payment and the trade-in would be $55.55 * 6% = $3.33.    Are down payments and trade-in allowances taxable if the vehicle is leased  outside the city?  The taxability of down payments or trade-in allowances for leases which are entered into outside  the city depends on the location of the use of the vehicle. If the vehicle is:    •  Used In the City   •  Used Outside the City   The tax would apply to the entire amount of the down payment and trade-in allowance.    The tax would not apply to the down payment or trade-in allowance when a lessee enters  into a lease agreement outside the city and will garage the vehicle outside the city  throughout the entire lease period. However, the lessor should start collecting the tax and  should collect the taxable portion of the down payment and trade-in value when the  individual starts garaging the vehicle in the city during the lease period.    Are the down payments and trade-in allowances taxable if a lessee moves into  or out of the city during the period of the lease agreement?  Yes, the tax applies to the fraction of the down payment and trade-in allowance which the  property is used in the city.   Example: A customer leases a vehicle from a leasing company located in Oak Brook. The lease  has a 36-month lease term. The customer garages the vehicle in Oak Brook for 10 months then  garages the vehicle in Chicago for the remainder of the lease. The customer made a down  payment of $1,000 and traded in a vehicle having a value of $1,000. At the time the vehicle is  used in the city the lease becomes taxable and 26/36 (26 taxable monthly lease payments out of a  36-month lease) of the down payment and 26/36 of the trade in value would be subject to the tax.   The taxable down payment and trade- in amount would be $2,000 * 26/36 = $1,444.45 and the  tax due on the down payment and trade-in would be $1,444.45 * 6% = $86.66.   Questions?

The  Chicago  Real  Property  Transfer  Tax  Ordinance  (the  “Ordinance”),  Chapter 3-33 of the Chicago Municipal Code (the “Code”), imposes a tax on the privilege  of transferring title to or beneficial interest in real property located in the City of Chicago.   Code § 3-33-030(A).  Section 3-33-020(A) of the Code provides that a beneficial interest  in  real  property  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  the  beneficial  interest  in  an  Illinois  land  trust, the lessee interest in certain ground leases, and the indirect interest in real property  as reflected by the controlling interest in a real estate entity.    Section 2.  Pursuant to Section 3-33-020(A), an ownership interest in a real estate  cooperative constitutes a beneficial interest in real property.  See 775 ILCS 5/3-101(A)  (defining “real property” to include “interests in real estate cooperatives” for purposes of  article 3 of the Illinois Human Rights Act).  Therefore, the transfer of a unit in a  cooperative (or “co-op”) building is subject to the tax, regardless of the form that the  transfer takes – be it sale of stock, transfer of beneficial interest in a land trust or  otherwise.  Taxability does not require that a controlling interest in a real estate  cooperative be transferred.  For example, the transfer of a single share of stock in a real  estate cooperative is taxable.

Chapter 3-33 of the Chicago Municipal Code (“Code”) imposes a  tax  upon  the  privilege  of  transferring  title  to,  or  beneficial  interest  in,  real  property  located in the corporate limits of the City of Chicago (the “City”). The tax is imposed at a  rate of $3.75 per $500 of the transfer price.  See section 3-33-030 of the Code.     Section 2.    Section 3-33-060 exempts various types of transfers from the tax   imposed by chapter 3-33 of the Code.  Section 3-3-060(L) exempts:     [t]ransfers  of  title  to,  or  beneficial  interest  in,  real  property  used  primarily  for  commercial  or  industrial  purposes  located  in  an  enterprise  zone,  as  defined  in  Chapter 16-12 of this code....     Section 3.    Section 16-12-020 defines the term enterprise zone. An enterprise  zone is a depressed area of the City that has been designated a “proposed enterprise zone”  by ordinance by the Chicago City Council and that has been approved and certified by  either  the  proper  state  or  federal  authorities  as  an  enterprise  zone.    Id.    Chapter  16-12  reiterates  the  exemption  from  the  Chicago  Transfer  Tax  and  specifically  lists  this  provision  of  the  Code  as  a  tax  incentive  or  benefit  available  to  businesses  within  an  enterprise zone.  Section 16-12-070(a)(3)(B) provides as follows:     The transfer of title to, or beneficial interest in, real property used primarily for  commercial  or  industrial  purposes  located  within  an  enterprise  zone  shall  be  exempt from the Chicago Real Property Transfer Tax, Chapter 3-33 of this Code.     Section 4.   The limiting language “used primarily for commercial or industrial  purposes” was added to chapters 3-33 and 16-12 on June 28, 1991, and became effective  on July 30, 1991. The purpose of this limiting language was to insure that exemptions of  the transfer tax were allowed to only the following types of properties:      a.  Property,  which  was  being  used  primarily  for  commercial  or  industrial  purposes  before  the  transfer  and  was  continuing  to  be  used  primarily  for  commercial or industrial purposes after the transfer.      Property,  which  was  not  being  used  primarily  for  commercial  or  industrial purposes before the transfer and was converted to use primarily  for commercial or industrial purposes after the transfer.   b.      Section 5.    Property,  which  is  used  primarily  for  commercial  purposes,  is  property  used  primarily  for  buying  or  selling  of  goods  and  services,  or  for  otherwise  providing goods and services, including any real estate used for hotel or motel purposes.  See  Cook  County  Real  Estate  Classification  Ordinance,  with  amendments  approved  March 16, 1992, Section 1(B)(9).     Section 6.    Property,  which  is  used  primarily  for  industrial  purposes,  is  property  used  primarily  in  manufacturing,  or  in  the  extraction  or  processing  of  raw  material unserviceable in their natural state to create new physical products or materials,  or  in  the  transportation  or  storage  of  raw  materials  or  finished  physical  goods  in  the  wholesale distribution of such materials or goods.  Id., section 1(B)(6).  Manufacturing  means  the  material  staging  and  production  of  goods  used  in  procedures  commonly  regarded as manufacturing, processing, fabrication, or assembling which changes existing  material into new shapes, new qualities, or new combinations. Id., section l(B)(7).     Section 7.      Section 8.    For  property  to  be  “primarily  used  for  commercial  or  industrial  purposes,” more than 50 percent of the property must be used for either commercial or  industrial purposes.   This Ruling is a restatement of current law, and the original     effective date of this Ruling has no effect on the enforcement of the Chicago Real Estate  Transfer Tax for periods prior to or subsequent to the original effective date.

Where title to, or beneficial interest in, real property is transferred  from one spouse to the other in a divorce or legal separation, it shall be presumed that the  consideration furnished for the transfer is equal to the fair market value of the interest in  the property conveyed, and the taxpayer shall have the burden of proving, with books,  records and other documentary evidence, that the presumption is incorrect.

Dated:  April  30, 2012   Exemption M.  There is an exemption from the Tax for ""[t]ransfers in which the   c.  deed or other instrument of transfer is issued to the mortgagee or secured creditor  pursuant to a mortgage or security interest foreclosure proceeding or sale or pursuant to a  transfer in lieu offoreclosure.""  Code Section 3-33-060(M).   Proof of exemptions.  As with other exemptions, the burden is on the taxpayer to   d.  prove, with written evidence, that the taxpayer is entitled to this exemption.  See,~,  Code Sections 3-4-130, 3-4-340; Telco Leasing, Inc. v.  Allphin, 63  Ill. 2d 305 (1976);  West Belmont, L.L.C. v.  City of Chicago, 349 Ill. App. 3d 46 (1 st Dist. 2004).   Rules and regulations.  The Director of the Department is authorized to adopt,   e.  promulgate and enforce rules and regulations pertaining to the administration and  enforcement of the Tax.  Code Section 3-33-140.   Section 2.  Exemption C Ruling.  The intent of Exemption C is to ensure that the Tax is not  paid when a bona fide lender acquires a mortgage or other security interest in real property for  the purpose of securing repayment of a loan from the lender.  Absent the exemption, bona fide  lenders would be taxed merely for protecting themselves from loss due to nonpayment of their  loans.  Bona fide lenders, such as banks, credit unions, and mortgage companies, are not in the  business of holding interest in property for investment or development and only acquire  mortgages to protect themselves from nonpayment of their loans.  The City Council does not  deem it appropriate that these lenders be required to pay the Tax when protecting themselves  through mortgages.  In enacting Exemption C, the City Council did not intend to benefit a non­ lender who takes an assignment of a mortgage or other security interest for the primary purpose  of obtaining title to the property for developing, investing in, or using the real property itself.  For example, where a real estate developer or investor takes an assignment of a mortgage from a  bona fide lender that has commenced foreclosure proceedings or otherwise notified the owner of  the property that the owner is in default on a loan, the transfer of the mortgage to the developer  or investor will not qualify for Exemption C and will instead be subject to the Tax.  To determine  whether Exemption C applies, the Department will review each transfer based on its particular  facts.   Exemption M Ruling. The intent of Exemption M is to ensure that the  Tax is not  Section 3.  paid when a  bona fide lender take title to, or beneficial interest in, real property for the purpose  of obtaining repayment of a loan from the lender, usually  through a foreclosure because the Tax  must be paid when the lender sells the property to  a third party.  Absent the exemption, bona fide  lenders would be taxed merely for protecting themselves from loss due to nonpayment of their  loans.  Bona fide lenders, such as banks, credit unions, and mortgage companies, are not in the  business of holding property for investment or development and only acquire real property when  enforcing their rights under mortgages.  The City Council does not deem it appropriate that these  lenders be required to pay the Tax when enforcing such rights.  In enacting Exemption M, the  City Council did not intend to benefit a non-lender who takes an assignment of a mortgage or  other security interest for the primary purpose of obtaining title to the property for developing,   2    investing in, or using the real property itself.  For example, where a real estate developer or  investor takes an assignment of a mortgage from a bona fide lender that has commenced  foreclosure proceedings or otherwise notified the owner ofthe property that the owner is in  default on a loan, the transfer of the real property to the developer or investor will not qualify for  Exemption M and will instead be subject to the Tax.  To determine whether Exemption M  applies, the Department will review each transfer based on its particular facts.   Relationship of Exemption C &  M Rulings.  No investor or developer in real   Section 4.  property shall be required to pay the Tax on both its acquisition of the mortgage and its  acquisition oftitle to or beneficial interest in real property.  The amount that the investor or  developer pays the bona fide lender for the mortgage and the note secured by the mortgage is the  ""transfer price"" for Tax purposes.  Although the Tax would generally be due upon the investor's  or developer's acquisition ofthe mortgage, for administrative purposes, the Tax shall be paid on  the earlier of the delivery or recording of the deed, assignment, or other instrument of transfer.   Advance opinions.  Anyone interested in obtaining an advance opinion from the   Section 5.  Department should refer to Uniform Revenue Procedures Ordinance Ruling #3, regarding Private  Letter Rulings.  Anyone desiring to close on a transaction before an advance opinion can be  obtained may pay the Tax under protest and apply for a refund, pursuant to Code Section 3-4­ 100.   This Ruling is a restatement and not a change of current law, and the effective   Section 6.  date of this Ruling has no effect on the enforcement of the Chicago Real Estate Transfer Tax for  periods prior to or subsequent to the effective date.   3    "

TO:  All property owners with cell phone towers:  The purpose of this informational bulletin is to discuss specific issues identified by the Chicago Department of Revenue (the “Department”) relating to the Chicago Real Property Transfer Tax (the “Transfer Tax”), chapter 3-33 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (the “Code”), as it relates to real property upon which wireless antennae and network communications equipment are placed (“cell sites”).  This bulletin also discusses a compliance initiative being offered by  the City.  What is the tax rate?  As of the date of this bulletin, the  Transfer Tax rate is $5.25 per $500.00 of the transfer price, or fraction thereof, of the real property or the beneficial interest in real property that is transferred.  The buyer is responsible for $3.75, which is the “City portion,” and the seller is responsible for $1.50, which is the “C.T.A. portion.”    Please refer to the Code and to the Department’s website for current tax rate information and other details.  The Department’s website address is:  www.cityofchicago.org/revenue  What is a cell site?  A cell site is the location where the wireless antennae and network communications equipment are placed.   #Chicago Real Property Transfer Tax  A cell site usually consists of a transmitter/receiver, antenna tower, transmission radios, and radio controllers.  A cell site is operated by a wireless service provider.  If I have a cell site, how do I know if I am subject to the Transfer Tax?  If you have given consideration for  an easement or have purchased a cell site, you may be subject to the Transfer Tax.  An easement is an interest in real property.  Accordingly, any money or other property transferred for an easement would be subject to the Transfer Tax.  Are there any penalties and interest that apply to unfiled declarations or unpaid taxes?  Generally, the Transfer Tax is due when the transfer occurs.  See Code Section 3-33-020.  When the Transfer Tax is not timely paid, interest accrues on the unpaid tax, and penalties are often assessed.  If no Transfer Tax Form (Form 7551) was filed at the time of the transfer, a penalty equal to 100% of the amount of the Transfer Tax is due.  Code Section 3-33-110.  If the failure to pay the Transfer Tax is determined to have been negligent or willful, a penalty of 25% of the tax is due.  Code Section 3-4-220.

No, regardless of the form that the transfer takes – be it sale of stock in the cooperative with a lease, a transfer of a beneficial interest in a land trust that owns the cooperative interest, or otherwise - the transfer is considered a taxable transaction and subject to the Transfer Tax.  Does it matter that a controlling interest in the cooperative is not transferred?  No, taxability does not require that a controlling interest in a cooperative (e.g., 50 percent of the shares of a cooperative)  be transferred.  The transfer of a single share of stock in a cooperative is considered a taxable transaction and subject to the Transfer Tax.  Does it matter that the instrument of transfer of the cooperative interest was not recorded?  No, the Transfer Tax is due upon the earlier of the transfer of the interest in the cooperative or the recording of the instrument of transfer of the interest in the cooperative (e.g., the lease, stock transfer, or assignment).  See Code Section 3-33-030(B)(1).  The unintentional or purposeful omission to record such document does not affect the applicability of the Transfer Tax.  How much tax is due on a transfer?  As of the date of this bulletin, the tax rate is $5.25 per $500.00 of the transfer price, or fraction thereof, for the transfer of an interest in a cooperative.  The buyer is responsible for $3.75   which is the “City portion” and the seller is responsible for $1.50 which is the “C.T.A. portion.”  Please refer to the Code and to the Department’s website for current tax rate information and other details.

What should I do if I have failed to pay the  Transfer Tax upon the transfer of my cooperative?  If you discover that you have unpaid tax and enter our voluntary disclosure program, applicable penalties will be waived.  However, if you fail to voluntarily disclose tax owed and you are discovered by the Department, all applicable penalties noted above will apply.

TO:  Owners of     real estate                         cooperatives: The purpose of this informational bulletin is to discuss specific issues identified by the Department of Revenue (the “Department) relating to the Chicago Real Property Transfer Tax (the “Transfer Tax”), chapter 3-33 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (the “Code”), as it relates to transfers of interests in real estate cooperatives (“cooperatives”).  What is a real estate cooperative?  Generally, a cooperative is a corporation, the stockholders of which are entitled to occupy an apartment in a building owned or leased by such corporation.  Often the owner of such stock receives from the corporation a lease of a particular apartment or unit in the building.   Is the transfer of a cooperative interest taxable under the Chicago Real Property Transfer Tax Ordinance?  Yes, the transfer of an interest in a cooperative is subject to the  Transfer Tax.  Under the Code, the Transfer Tax is imposed upon the privilege of transferring title to, or beneficial interest in, real property located in the City.  Code Section 3-33-020.  An interest in a cooperative is considered a beneficial interest in real property.  See Chicago Department of Revenue Real Property Transfer Tax Ruling #1 (April 28, 1994; republished June 1, 2004).  Accordingly, the transfer of such interest is subject to the Transfer Tax.

General Information:  The Tax is imposed on the privilege of transferring title to, or beneficial interest in, real property located in the City of Chicago.  See section 3-33-030 of the Code.  The tax rate is $3.75 per $500.00 of the transfer price, or fraction thereof, of the real property, or beneficial interest in the property.  Id.  Governmental or Charitable Organization Exemption - Subsection 3-33-060(B) of the Code; Section 3, Paragraph B of the Form:  Transfers involving real property (1) acquired by or from a governmental body; (2) acquired by any corporation, society, association, foundation or institution organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious or educational purposes; or (3) acquired by any international organization not subject to local taxes under applicable law are exempt.  The Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddy Mac”) do not qualify as governmental bodies.  Transfers for less than $500 - Subsection 3-33-060(E) of the Municipal Code; Section 3, Paragraph E of the Form:  Transfers in which the transfer  price is less than $500 are exempt.  The “transfer price” means the consideration furnished for the transfer of title to, or beneficial interest in, real property, valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits and property, determined without any deduction for mortgages, liens or encumbrances, and specifically including the amount of any indebtedness or obligation canceled or discharged in connection with the transfer.  See subsection 3-33- 020(H).   Typical types of transfers that fall into this category are (1) transfers between a trust and its beneficiaries and (2) transfers of gifts.  With respect to transfers between trusts and their beneficiaries, only the following types of transfers are exempt from the tax:  (a) transfers from the sole beneficiaries to the trust, where the trust agreement provides that the beneficial ownership of the beneficiaries is the same as it was before the transfer into trust, and (b) transfers from the trust to the sole beneficiaries of the trust, where the distribution agreement provides that the ownership of the beneficiaries is the  same as it was before the transfer out of the trust.  With respect to transfers which result from divorce or separation proceedings, it is presumed that the consideration given for the transfer of real property between spouses is equal to the fair market value of the interest conveyed, and is subject to the Tax.  For example, if one spouse is ordered or agrees to transfer to the other spouse his or her interest in real property, which is owned jointly with the other spouse, the spouse who receives the transferring spouse’s interest is subject to taxation; and the amount of the transfer price will be presumed to be one-half of the fair market value of the real property .  See Chicago Department of Revenue Real Property Transfer Tax Ruling #3, October 3, 2005.   Transfers of property in exchange for an interest in a corporation, limited liability corporation, or other legal entity are taxable events, unless the transferor is the sole owner of the legal entity to which the property is being transferred.  The transfer price is the fair market value of the real property.  For example, if an individual or legal entity transferred its real property to a partnership and received only a one-half interest in the partnership, a Transfer Tax would be due on one-half of the fair market value of the real property.

Transfers where the property is intended to be converted into residential use and such use consumes 50% or more of the property do not qualify for the exemption.  See Chicago Department of Revenue Real Property Transfer Tax Ruling #2, May 13, 2004.    Transfers to Secured Creditors - Subsection 3-33-060(M) of the Code; Section 3, Paragraph M of the Form:  Transfers in which the deed or other instrument of transfer is issued to the mortgagee or secured creditor pursuant to a mortgage or security interest foreclosure proceeding or sale or pursuant to a transfer in lieu of foreclosure are exempt.  When a creditor holds a secured interest in property (e.g., a bank or savings and loan through a mortgage) and acquires the property either (a) at a foreclosure sale for an amount, which is equal to or less than the outstanding debt that is secured by the property, or (b) through a deed from the debtor in lieu of the foreclosure action, the transfer is exempt from the Tax.  A second mortgagee that acquires property through a foreclosure and assumes the debt of the primary secured lender is taxable on the amount of the outstanding debt owed to the primary lender.  For example, if a primary lender has an outstanding debt of $200,000 secured with real property, and a second lender has an outstanding debt of $100,000 secured with the same property; and if the second lender took a deed for the property from the debtor, in lieu of foreclosing on the property, then the second lender would incur a tax on the amount of the outstanding debt, which  it assumed (i.e., $200,000).  Other information:  Where the transfer price reported on the Form is different than the purchase price of the property, the difference must be fully explained, with full documentation attached to the Form.  The Transfer Tax is due upon the earlier of the delivery or recording of the deed, assignment or other instrument of transfer (see section 3- 33-030) and is payable through the purchase of stamps (see section 3- 33-040).  Title companies are responsible for making sure that stamps are purchased, cancelled, and affixed to the deed or other instrument of transfer, when they receive the proceeds for the stamps at the closing.  See section 3-33-040.  Failure to purchase and affix the stamps will subject them to interest and penalties that accrue on the unpaid tax.  A program is being offered by the City during the period beginning October 24, 2005, and ending December 16, 2005, to provide amnesty from interest and penalties on Transfer Tax liabilities incurred prior to July 1, 2005.  Amnesty is not available with respect to any tax identified in any written notice of tax audit or tax investigation that the Department has sent to a taxpayer or other debtor.  Persons interested in acquiring amnesty  must apply by filling out the application available at www.cityofchicago.org.  A person’s failure to properly apply for amnesty continues to subject such person to penalties and interest on unpaid Transfer Taxes, and may also subject the person to an additional amnesty penalty.

Daley,  Mayor,   and the Members of the City Council   City of Chicago  Chicago,  Illinois   We have audited the accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards of the City of Chicago,  Illinois  for the year ended December 31,  2009.  This financial  statement is the responsibility of the City of Chicago's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an  opinion on  the financial  statement based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in  accordance with  auditing  standards generally accepted in  the United States of  America;  the standards applicable to  financial audits contained in  Government Auditing Standards,  issued by the  Comptroller General of the United States;  and OMB Circular A-133,  Audits of States,  Local Governments,  and  Non-Profit Organizations. Those standards and  OMB Circular A-133 require that we plan  and  perform the audit  to  obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement is free of material misstatement. An audit  includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  the financial statement.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by  management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit  provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   In  our opinion,  the schedule of expenditures of federal awards referred to above presents fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the expenditures of federal  awards of the City of Chicago,  Illinois for the year ended  December 31,  2009 in conformity with  accounting principles generally accepted  in  the United States of America.   §~o!L11j VWltiW  ~/ LLf   September 20,  2010   ~ ,nlndepende~\ membel ol  BAKER TILLY  INTERNATIONAL   Page 1   CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS  SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009                    Agency/ Program/ Grant Title  Federal CFDA Number  Federal Grant/ State  Pass-Through  Number  2009 Federal  Expenditures  2009  Non-Federal Expenditures  2009  Subrecipient Expenditures  I.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      BASIS OF ACCOUNTING   The accounting records for some grant programs are maintained on the modified accrual basis of  accounting. Under the modified accrual basis, revenues are recorded when susceptible to accrual, i.e.,  both measurable and available. Available means collectible within the current period or soon enough  thereafter to be used to pay liabilities of the current period. Expenditures are recorded when the liability is  incurred. The accounting records for other grant programs are maintained on the accrual basis, i.e., when  the revenue has been earned and the liability is incurred.   Page 18

This financial  statement is the responsibility of the City of Chicago's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an  opinion on  the financial  statement based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in  accordance with  auditing  standards generally accepted  in  the  United States of  America;  the standards applicable to financial audits contained  in  Government Auditing Standards,  issued by the  Comptroller General of the United States; and  OMB Circular A-133, Audits of States,  Local Governments, and  Non-Profit Organizations. Those standards and  OMB Circular A-133  require that we  plan and  perform the audit  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement is free of material misstatement. An  audit  includes examining , on  a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and  disclosures in  the financial  statement.  An  audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and  significant estimates made by  management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial  statement presentation. We believe that our audit  provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   In  our opinion,  the schedule of expenditures of federal awards referred to above presents fairly, in  all  material  respects,  the expenditures of federal  awards of the City of Chicago, Illinois for the year ended  December 31,  2010 in  conformity with  accounting  principles generally accepted in  the United States of America.

Finding 2011-8  CFDA No.    Federal Agency    Pass-through Agency      City Department    Criteria:  The A-102 Common Rule and Code of Federal Regulations require that non-federal entities  receiving federal awards establish and maintain internal control designed to reasonably ensure  compliance with federal laws, regulations, and program compliance requirements. To minimize the risk of  errors, internal controls should be in place for all program compliance requirements, including the  appropriate review and approval of disbursements to ensure they are allowable under the program.    Condition:  During our testing of the Justice Assistance Grant (JAG), we found one invoice that did not  contain evidence of proper review and approval of expenditures charged to the program.    Effect:  Lack of effective internal controls in the disbursements function could result in unallowable costs  charged to the program.    Questioned Costs: None    Cause:  The invoice cited was paid through a new centralized invoice processing function at the City,  and the necessary approvals were not evidenced for this transaction.    Recommendation: The City should review its control procedures to ensure that all invoices are being  reviewed and approved prior to payment.    Views of Responsible Officials:  See Corrective Action Plan.

Management’s Responsibility    Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design,  implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of a  financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.    Auditors’ Responsibility    Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statement based on our audit.    We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by  the Comptroller General of the United States; and OMB Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments,  and Non-Profit Organizations. Those standards and OMB Circular A-133 require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement is free from material misstatement.     An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the  financial statement. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the financial statement, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk  assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of  the financial statement in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we  express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall  presentation of the financial statement.     We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion.         Page 1      To the Honorable Rahm Emanuel, Mayor,     and the Members of the City Council  City of Chicago      Opinion    In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards referred to above presents fairly, in all material  respects, the expenditures of federal awards of the City of Chicago, Illinois for the year ended December 31,  2012 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Management's Responsibility   Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of this financial statement in accordance  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design,  implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of a  financial statement that is free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.   Auditors' Responsibility   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial statement based on our audit.  We conducted our  audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards  applicable to financial audits contained in  Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General  of the United States; and OMS Circular A-133, Audits of States,  Local Governments, and Non-Profit  Organizations. Those standards and OMS Circular A-133 require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement is free from  material misstatement.   An  audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the  financial statement. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the financial statement, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk  assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of  the financial statement in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we  express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall  presentation of the financial statement.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion.   ~ anindtpendentmemberof  BAKER TI LLY  INTERNATIONAL   An Affirmarivt' Action Equal Opportunity Employer   Page 1   To the Honorable Rahm Emanuel, Mayor,   and the  Members of the City Council  City of Chicago   Opinion   In  our opinion, the financial statement referred to above presents fairly,  in all material respects, the  expenditures of federal awards of the City of Chicago,  Illinois for the year ended December 31, 2013 in  accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Management's Responsibility   Management is  responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of this financial statement in  accordance  with accounting principles generally accepted  in the United States of America; this includes the design,  implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of a  financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.   Auditors' Responsibility   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial statement based on  our audit. We conducted our  audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards  applicable to financial audits contained  in  Government Auditing Standards,  issued by the Comptroller General  of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S.  Code of Federal Regulations Part 200,  Uniform  Administrative Requirements,  Cost Principles,  and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statement is free from  material misstatement.   An  audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the  financial statement. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the financial statement, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk  assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of  the financial statement in  order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we  express no such opinion. An  audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting  policies used and  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall  presentation of the financial statement.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion.

FINDING 2015-003 (cont.)   >  There was one instance out of 25 payroll transactions sampled where an employee payroll- related item was charged 100% to a grant, but there was no semi-annual certification on file  for this employee.     >  There was one instance of 25 payroll transactions sampled where an employee was charged   to a grant other than the grant that was certified on the salary certification form.   The sample was not statistically valid.    Effect: CDPH is at risk of incorrectly charging an employee's salary to the grant.    Questioned Costs:  Questioned costs could not be determined.    Cause:    CDPH  does  not  have  a  consistent  system  for  obtaining,  reviewing,  and  maintaining  the  necessary supporting documentation for payroll charges in accordance with federal requirements.    Recommendation:  We  understand  the  City,  and  specifically  CDPH,  is  developing  a  time  and  effort  reporting system which CDPH plans to implement in order to have employees charge their time across  multiple  grants  and  meet  the  applicable  requirements.  Until  implemented,  CDPH  should  continue  to  monitor  employees’  time  allocations  and  maintain  documentation  required  by  OMB  Circular  A-87  for  grants awarded prior to December 26, 2014 or the Uniform Guidance for Federal Awards for those grants  awarded on or after December 26, 2014.    Views of Responsible Officials:  See Corrective Action Plan.                                Page 27

Management’s Responsibility    Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of this financial statement in accordance  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design,  implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of a  financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.    Auditors’ Responsibility    Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial statement based on our audit. We conducted our  audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards  applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General  of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform  Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statement is free from material misstatement.     An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the  financial statement. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the financial statement, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk  assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of  the financial statement in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we  express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall  presentation of the financial statement.     We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion.

Those  Regulations read as set forth below.    Bea Reyna-Hickey  Director of Revenue  City of Chicago     CITY OF CHICAGO   DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE   RESTAURANT TAX REGULATIONS   2.   1.     Effective Date:  April 1, 2004      The  Tax.    Effective  April  1,  2004,  a  tax  is  imposed  on  each  place  for  eating located in the City, at the rate of 0.25 per cent of the selling price of all food and  beverages sold at retail by the place for eating.  See section 3-30-030 of the Municipal  Code of Chicago (“Code”).      Place for Eating.    The term “place for eating” means any restaurant or  other business, by whatever name, that is a place for eating under 65 ILCS 5/11-42-5,  which provides that “[t]he corporate authorities of each municipality may ... license, tax,  and regulate all places for eating.”  See section 3-30-020 of the Code.  More specifically,  a “place for eating” means any place at which a business (a) is engaged in the sale at  retail of “food prepared for immediate consumption” (see ¶ 3 below) and (b) provides for  on-premises consumption of the food it sells (see ¶ 4).      Food Prepared for Immediate Consumption.  The term “food prepared for  immediate consumption” has the meaning set forth in the Illinois Retailers’ Occupation  Tax Act regulations.  See 86 Ill. Adm. Code 130.310.  In general, it means food made  ready  by  the  retailer  to  be  eaten  without  substantial  delay  after  the  final  stage  of  preparation by the retailer.  Because the “reduced” sales tax rate provided by section 2-10  of the Illinois Retailers’ Occupation Tax Act, 35 ILCS 120/2-10, does not apply to food  prepared for immediate consumption, any food that qualifies for the “reduced” sales tax  rate  provided  by  section  2-10  of  the  Illinois  Retailers’  Occupation  Tax  Act,  35  ILCS  120/2-10, is not food prepared for immediate consumption.        A  business  provides  for  on-premises  consumption of the food it sells when it provides accommodations for eating the food on  the  premises.    The  term  “premises”  has  the meaning  set  forth  in  the  Illinois  Retailers’  Occupation Tax Act regulations.  See 86 Ill. Adm. Code 130.310.  In general, it means   On-Premises  Consumption.   4.   3.   5.   the area over which the business exercises control, whether by lease, contract, license or  otherwise.  For example, a restaurant in a food court with a lease allowing its patrons to  use  a  common  seating  area  provides  for  on-premises  consumption  and  is  a  place  for  eating.    Mixed Facilities or Operations.  If a place for eating is a part of a larger  facility  or  operation  run  by  the  same  business,  then  only  the  place  for  eating  and  its  operations are subject to the tax.  For example:       If a grocery or department store includes a café that sells food prepared for  immediate consumption and provides for on-premises consumption of the  food it sells, then the café is a place for eating, but the rest of the store is  not, and only the sales of the café will be taxed.   a.   If an establishment includes both a restaurant selling food and a bar selling  only drinks, then the restaurant is a place for eating, but the bar is not, and  only the sales of the restaurant operation will be taxed.             b.   c.   If a business operates as a bar during the week, selling only drinks, but  operates as a place for eating on weekends, then the tax will apply only to  its  sales  of  food  and  beverages  on  weekends,  when  it  is  operating  as  a  place for eating.   6.       A  business  wishing  to  take  advantage  of  this  “mixed  facilities  or  operations”  provision  must  utilize  a  reliable  means  of  documenting,  recording  and  accounting  for  receipts  that  clearly  separates  the  taxable  sales  from  the  non-taxable  sales,  so  that  the  amount of its tax liability can be correctly determined and confirmed.  In the absence of  such a reliable means of documenting, recording and accounting for receipts, it will be  presumed  that  all  sales  of  food  and  beverages  are  attributable  to  the  place  for  eating,  operating in its capacity as a place for eating, and are therefore taxable.    Sale At Retail.  The term “sale at retail” has the meaning set forth in the    Illinois Retailers’ Occupation Tax Act, as amended, 35 ILCS 120/1 and following.  See  section 3-30-020 (A) (6) of the Code.  In general, it means the transfer of ownership of  food or beverages to a purchaser for the purpose of consumption, and not for the purpose  of resale.    Exemptions.  Section 3-30-040 exempts from the tax all sales of food and    beverages  which  are  exempt  from  tax  under  the  provisions  of  the  Illinois  Retailers’  Occupation Tax, as amended, 35 ILCS 120/1 and following.  Therefore, if a retailer is  exempt from the State tax on a particular sale of food or beverage, the retailer will be  exempt  from  the  Chicago  tax  on  the  same  sale  of  food  or  beverage.    For  example,  cafeteria food sold by schools to their students and food sold by hospitals to their patients  are not subject to the tax.  Section 3-30-040 also exempts all sales of food and beverages  which may not be taxed by the City under applicable law.     7.   8.     Occasional or de minimis sales.  Section 3-30-050 provides that a place  for eating whose liability for the tax would, in the absence of that section, be less than or  equal to $200 in an annual tax year (July 1 through June 30) shall not be required to file a  return or make any payment of tax with regard to that tax and annual tax year.  At the  stated rate of .25 percent, this exempts places for eating with up to $80,000 in taxable  sales.  The provision applies to each place for eating, which means that separate locations  of commonly-owned chains, for example, will each be entitled to take advantage of the  exemption.    The  provision  is  not  available  to  any  place  for  eating  that  has  separately  stated and charged the tax to its customers during that annual tax year, as any amounts  separately stated and charged to customers must be remitted to the City's Department of  Revenue  (the  “Department”).    See  Code  section  3-4-280.    For  the  three-month  period  beginning April 1, 2004 and ending June 30, 2004, the exemption shall be for places for  eating whose liability for the tax would, in the absence of the exemption, be less than or  equal  to  $50  (i.e.,  one-quarter  of  the  annual  $200  exemption),  thus  exempting  up  to  $20,000 in taxable sales taking place during those three months.      Payments.    Places  for  eating  must  pay  the  tax  to  the  Department  in  accordance  with  either  Code  section  3-4-187  (providing  for  the  payment  of  actual  tax  liabilities on a monthly basis under certain conditions, with an option to pay on an annual  basis where the taxpayer’s total liability for the tax was less than or equal to $1,200 for  the twelve month period immediately preceding the current annual tax year) or section 3- 4-188 (providing the option of paying estimated taxes on a monthly basis under certain  conditions).    For  the  three-month  period  beginning  April  1,  2004  and  ending  June  30,  2004, along with the annual tax year beginning July 1, 2004 and ending June 30, 2005,  payments must be made monthly, based on actual tax liabilities.    Returns.  A place for eating must file a tax return with the Department on    or before August 15 in accordance with Code sections 3-4-186 (providing for the filing of  returns on an annual basis under certain conditions) and 3-4-189 (providing for the filing  of consolidated returns under certain conditions).    Billing.  The legal incidence of the tax is on the place for eating.  A place    for eating is permitted but not required to pass the tax on to its customers by separately  stating the tax as an additional charge, which charge may be stated in combination, in a  single amount, with other taxes imposed at the federal, state or local level.  The decision  to pass the tax on to customers may carry certain consequences, such as the unavailability  of the “occasional or de minimis sales” provision (¶ 8 above) and the inability of a place  for  eating  to  obtain  a  refund  under  certain  circumstances  (see  section  3-4-100  of  the  Code).    Bracketing.  When determining the amount of tax to be paid and/or passed    on in connection with a given meal or other order of food or beverage, a place for eating  may employ the same system of rounding (also known as “bracketing”) that is accepted  by  the  Illinois  Department  of  Revenue  in  connection  with  the  Illinois  Retailers’  Occupation Tax, as amended, 35 ILCS 120/1 and following.     12.   9.   10.   11.   13.   Questions.  As with most taxes, there will be situations that require     clarification in their application, and taxpayers are encouraged to contact the Department  for guidance.

Please refer to the ordinance and regulations for exact terms.     What is the tax rate?  Please refer to the Chicago Department of Revenue website for current tax rate information.  Our web address is:  www.cityofchicago.org/revenue  How do I know if my establishment is subject to the Restaurant Tax?  Two criteria must be met in order for your establishment to be subject to the Restaurant Tax.    1.  The establishment must sell food prepared for immediate consumption.  Generally, this refers to food made ready by the retailer to be eaten without substantial delay after the final stage of preparation. 2.  The establishment must provide for on- premises consumption.  Generally, this means that the business provides accommodations for eating the food on the premises, regardless of whether or not the food is actually eaten on the premises.  If your establishment meets both criteria then your business is subject to the Restaurant Tax.  Unless you meet the  requirements for “mixed facilities or operations” (see Restaurant Tax   Regulations Part 5), the tax applies to the selling price of all non-exempt food and beverages (both alcoholic and non- alcoholic) that your establishment sells at retail.  What are considered to be accommodations?  Examples of accommodations include, but are not limited to:    - Tables - Chairs - Ledge / Counter-tops - Food Court Seating - Benches  Are carry out and delivery orders taxable?  If you meet both criteria, then all of your non-exempt retail sales of food are taxable whether it is carry out, delivery, or consumed on-premises.  Are there any types of exempt sales?  Sales which are exempt under the Illinois Retailers’ Occupation Tax are exempt.  For example, school cafeteria food sold to students and hospital food sold to patients are not taxable.  Are alcohol sales taxable?  Businesses that meet the two criteria must report their alcohol sales with their food sales.  This includes establishments whose primary source of revenue is from liquor sales, but meet the two criteria listed previously (i.e. bars, taverns, etc.)  For example, bars and taverns that heat and sell frozen pizzas have been determined to be subject to the tax.   Are catering sales taxable?  If your business provides catering services, there are several factors that you   must consider in order for those sales to be excluded from the tax.  If your business is taxable for the Restaurant Tax, your catering service is also taxable if the “service” is limited to delivery of the food.  Factors such as separate kitchen, separate accounting records, and additional services provided to the client must be considered before taking a deduction for catering.  (Please reference the Restaurant Tax Regulations Section 5 concerning “mixed facilities or operations”).  Are ledges and counters considered accommodations for eating?  If your business offers a ledge or counter for your customers to eat their food, you are subject to the restaurant tax.  Please note that if your business is a “Carry-Out Only” facility, but you provide a table and/or a chair for waiting customers, you will not be considered taxable unless on- premises consumption of food is allowed.  What should I do if after reading this bulletin I find I may have made errors on a previous year’s filing?  If you feel you have made errors on your Restaurant Tax return, please contact our Tax Policy Division.  We will work with you to correct your return and help make sure you do not make the same errors in the future.

The final regulations conform to this  statutory language, thus clarifying that  household income does not include the  modified adjusted gross income of a  family member who is required to file  a tax return solely to report tax imposed  under Code sections other than section  1 (for example, the early distribution  penalty imposed under section 72(q) or  self-employment tax under section  1401).  c. Modified Adjusted Gross Income  Under the proposed regulations,  modified adjusted gross income is  adjusted gross income increased by  amounts excluded from gross income  under section 911 and tax-exempt  interest a taxpayer receives or accrues  during the taxable year. The 3%  Withholding Repeal and Job Creation  Act, Public Law 112–56 (125 Stat. 711  (2011)), which was enacted after the  proposed regulations were published,  amended the definition of modified  adjusted gross income to include Social  Security benefits (as defined in section  86(d)) not included in gross income  under section 86. The final regulations  reflect this amendment.  d. Lawfully Present   Under section 36B(c)(1)(B) and the   proposed regulations, a taxpayer who is  an individual lawfully present in the  United States may be treated as an  applicable taxpayer if the taxpayer’s  household income is under 100 percent  of the Federal poverty line (FPL) and the  taxpayer is not eligible for Medicaid.  Under section 1321(f)(3) of the  Affordable Care Act, an individual who  is not lawfully present in the United  States may not enroll in a qualified  health plan through an Exchange. The  proposed regulations define lawfully  present by referencing 45 CFR 152.2,  which also is referenced in defining  lawfully present in proposed regulations  on Exchanges under 45 CFR 155.20  issued by the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS).   Commentators requested that the final   regulations expand the definition of  lawfully present to include the  categories of immigrants described in  the Children’s Health Insurance  Program Reauthorization Act. One  commentator stated that the final  regulations should allow States to use  existing administrative mechanisms to  determine eligibility if those  mechanisms are not more restrictive  than Federal law.   To maintain consistency with the  HHS Exchange final regulations, the  final regulations define lawfully present  by referencing 45 CFR 155.20, the   definition in the HHS Exchange final  regulations.  e. Federal Poverty Line   The proposed regulations define   federal poverty line by reference to the  Federal poverty guidelines published  annually by HHS. The Federal poverty  guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii differ  from the guidelines for the 48  contiguous states and the District of  Columbia. The final regulations clarify  that, if married taxpayers reside in  separate States with different Federal  poverty guidelines, or if a taxpayer  resides in States with different Federal  poverty guidelines during the year, the  Federal poverty line that applies for  purposes of section 36B and the  associated regulations is the higher  Federal poverty line (resulting in a  lower percentage of the Federal poverty  line for the taxpayers’ household  income and family size).  f. Federally-Facilitated Exchange   Under the proposed regulations, the   term Exchange has the same meaning as  in 45 CFR 155.20, which provides that  the term Exchange refers to a State  Exchange, regional Exchange, subsidiary  Exchange, and Federally-facilitated  Exchange.   Commentators disagreed on whether   the language in section 36B(b)(2)(A)  limits the availability of the premium  tax credit only to taxpayers who enroll  in qualified health plans on State  Exchanges.   The statutory language of section 36B   and other provisions of the Affordable  Care Act support the interpretation that  credits are available to taxpayers who  obtain coverage through a State  Exchange, regional Exchange, subsidiary  Exchange, and the Federally-facilitated  Exchange. Moreover, the relevant  legislative history does not demonstrate  that Congress intended to limit the  premium tax credit to State Exchanges.  Accordingly, the final regulations  maintain the rule in the proposed  regulations because it is consistent with  the language, purpose, and structure of  section 36B and the Affordable Care Act  as a whole.  g. Rating Area   The proposed regulations define   rating area as an Exchange service area,  as described in 45 CFR 155.20.  Commentators suggested that an  Exchange service area is different than  a rating area as that term is used in  section 36B(b)(3) for determining the  applicable benchmark plan. The final  regulations reserve the definition of  rating area.   S E L U R h     t i     w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o     2. Eligibility for the Premium Tax Credit  a. Applicable Taxpayer   Under section 36B(c)(1) and the  proposed regulations, in general a  taxpayer is an applicable taxpayer for a  taxable year only if the taxpayer’s  household income for the taxable year is  at least 100 percent but not more than  400 percent of the FPL for the taxpayer’s  family size. Commentators requested  that the final regulations treat a taxpayer  whose household income exceeds 400  percent of the FPL for the taxpayer’s  family size as an applicable taxpayer if,  at enrollment, the Exchange estimates  that the taxpayer’s household income  will be between 100 and 400 percent of  the FPL for the taxpayer’s family size  and approves advance credit payments.  Other commentators advocated allowing  taxpayers with household income above  400 percent of the FPL for their family  size to be treated as eligible for a  premium tax credit for the months  before a change in circumstances  affecting household income occurs or  for the months for which the taxpayer  receives advance payments.   The final regulations do not adopt   these comments because they are  contrary to the language of section 36B  limiting the premium tax credit to  taxpayers with household income for  the taxable year at or below 400 percent  of the FPL for the taxpayer’s family size.  Commentators requested that the final   regulations clarify that a taxpayer who  has household income between 100  percent and 133 percent of the FPL but  is not eligible for Medicaid qualifies for  the premium tax credit. Under section  36B(c)(1)(A) and the proposed  regulations, an applicable taxpayer who  may claim the premium tax credit is a  taxpayer with household income  between 100 and 400 percent of the FPL  for the family size. Thus, it is clear that  a taxpayer with household income  between 100 percent and 133 percent of  the FPL for the taxpayer’s family size  may be an applicable taxpayer.   Commentators requested that the final   regulations allow an individual who  may be claimed as a dependent by  another taxpayer to qualify as an  applicable taxpayer for a taxable year if,  for the taxable year, another taxpayer  does not claim the individual as a  dependent. The final regulations do not  adopt this comment because it is  inconsistent with section 36B(c)(1)(D),  which provides that a premium tax  credit is not allowed to any individual  for whom a deduction under section 151  is ‘‘allowable to another taxpayer’’ for  the taxable year.      n o s n b o r s  i  VerDate Mar<15>2010  16:20 May 22, 2012 Jkt 226001 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23MYR1.SGM 23MYR1  Federal  Register / Vol.  77,  No.  100 / Wednesday,  May  23,  2012 / Rules  and  Regulations   30379   b. Incarceration   Under section 1312(f) of the   Affordable Care Act, individuals who  are incarcerated (other than pending  disposition of charges) may not enroll in  a qualified health plan through an  Exchange. The proposed regulations  provide, however, that an individual  who is incarcerated may be allowed a  premium tax credit if a family member  is enrolled in a qualified health plan.  A commentator suggested that the   rules relating to incarcerated  individuals should apply to individuals  incarcerated pending disposition of  charges, as is the case under the  Medicaid program. The comment  addresses an issue beyond the scope of  the premium tax credit regulations.  Standards for enrollment in a qualified  health plan fall under rules within the  jurisdiction of HHS.  c. Minimum Essential Coverage  i. Government-Sponsored Coverage  A. Time of Eligibility   The proposed regulations provide that   an individual generally is treated as  eligible for a government-sponsored  program on the first day of the first full  month in which the individual may  receive benefits under the program. The  proposed regulations further provide  that an individual who fails to complete  the requirements necessary to receive  benefits available under a government-  sponsored program (other than a  veteran’s health care program)  reasonably promptly is treated as  eligible for the coverage on the first day  of the second calendar month following  the event that establishes eligibility.  Commentators asked that the final   regulations allow individuals a certain  amount of time to complete the  requirements (such as submitting an  application) necessary to obtain  government-sponsored minimum  essential coverage. Some commentators  suggested that the final regulations  could provide this period by defining  ‘‘reasonably promptly’’ as 90 days after  the event that establishes eligibility.  Commentators requested that the final  regulations allow exemptions from the  90-day period, however, when  additional delay in receiving benefits  occurs despite the good faith efforts of  the taxpayer, for example as a result of  inaction of a government agency or  official.   To provide greater clarity, the final   regulations delete the language  ‘‘reasonably promptly’’ and extend this  time period. Under the final regulations,  an individual who fails to complete the  requirements necessary to receive  benefits available under a government-   sponsored program by the last day of the  third full calendar month following the  event that establishes eligibility is  treated as eligible for the coverage on  the first day of the fourth calendar  month. Because an individual who  timely completes the necessary  requirements is treated as eligible for  government-sponsored minimum  essential coverage no earlier than the  first month that the individual may  receive benefits, this 3-month time  period does not include the time needed  for a government agency to process an  application.   The proposed regulations request  comments on whether rules should  provide flexibility if operational  challenges prevent timely transition  from coverage under a qualified health  plan to coverage under a government-  sponsored program. Commentators  stated that the final regulations should  provide that an individual transitioning  from a qualified health plan to coverage  under a government-sponsored program  should not be treated as eligible for  government-sponsored minimum  essential coverage until the individual is  able to effectively terminate his or her  qualified health plan coverage. They  expressed concern that an individual  may be unable to discontinue advance  credit payments by the beginning of a  month for which the individual is  eligible for government-sponsored  coverage and could be responsible for  an excess advance payment for that  month.   The concerns expressed in these   comments are addressed in the HHS  final regulations on Exchanges. Under  45 CFR 155.430, an Exchange must  permit an enrollee to terminate coverage  in a qualified health plan no later than  14 days after the enrollee requests  termination. For an enrollee who is  newly eligible for Medicaid or the  Children’s Health Insurance Program  (CHIP), 45 CFR 155.430(d)(2)(iv)  provides that qualified health plan  coverage terminates on the last day  before Medicaid or CHIP coverage  begins. These termination rules enable  individuals transitioning to coverage  under a government-sponsored program  to effectively terminate qualified health  plan coverage (and liability for advance  credit payments) before they are eligible  for government-sponsored minimum  essential coverage.  B. Definition of ‘‘Eligible’’   The proposed regulations provide that  an individual is eligible for government-  sponsored minimum essential coverage  when an individual meets the  requirements for coverage under the  program. For administrative   convenience, however, because the  standards for eligibility in veterans’  programs do not allow Exchanges to  identify everyone who may be eligible  for veterans’ coverage at the time he or  she is seeking an eligibility  determination for advance payments of  the premium tax credit, the proposed  regulations provide that an individual is  eligible for minimum essential coverage  under the veteran’s health care program  authorized under chapter 17 or 18 of  Title 38, U.S.C. only if the individual is  enrolled in a veteran’s health care  program identified as minimum  essential coverage in regulations issued  under section 5000A.   The final regulations conform the   rules to amendments to section 5000A  that delete the word ‘‘veteran’s’’ in  describing health care programs under  chapter 17 or 18 of Title 38. Thus, the  special rule for veterans’ coverage may  apply to individuals who are not  veterans but are eligible for the Civilian  Health and Medical Program of the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or  the VA’s spina bifida program.   Commentators requested that the final   regulations define eligibility for  government-sponsored programs as  actual enrollment for individuals  suffering from end stage renal disease  who become eligible for Medicare as a  result of their diagnosis. Other  commentators requested this treatment  for any individual suffering from an  acute illness who becomes eligible for a  government-sponsored program. The  commentators asserted that these  seriously-ill individuals should be able  to choose to remain enrolled in a  qualified health plan with the benefit of  a premium tax credit to maintain  continuity of medical care, which may  be disrupted if the individual loses  eligibility for the premium tax credit  and is required to move to a  government-sponsored program in  which the individual’s medical provider  does not participate.   Section 36B(c)(2)(B) establishes a   clear structure under which eligibility  for government-sponsored minimum  essential coverage in a given month  precludes including an individual in a  taxpayer’s coverage family for purposes  of computing the premium assistance  amount for that month. In keeping with  the statutory scheme, the final  regulations do not adopt these  comments. However, the IRS and the  Treasury Department expect to publish  additional guidance, see § 601.601(d)(2),  clarifying when or if an individual  becomes ‘‘eligible for government-  sponsored minimum essential coverage’’  when the eligibility for that coverage is  a result of a particular illness or   S E L U R h     t i     w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o        n o s n b o r s  i  VerDate Mar<15>2010  16:20 May 22, 2012 Jkt 226001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23MYR1.SGM 23MYR1  30380   Federal  Register / Vol.  77,  No.  100 / Wednesday,  May  23,  2012 / Rules  and  Regulations   condition. For example, as the preamble  to the proposed regulations notes, the  additional guidance would clarify the  rules in the case of eligibility for  Medicaid on the basis of blindness or  disability.  C. Eligibility for Limited Benefits   Commentators requested that the final   regulations address whether eligibility  for benefits with a limited scope under  government programs (for example,  eligibility only for family planning  services under Medicaid) constitutes  eligibility for minimum essential  coverage. The final regulations do not  address these comments because  minimum essential coverage is defined  in section 5000A(f). It is anticipated that  regulations under section 5000A will  provide that government-sponsored  health benefit programs that offer only  very limited benefits are not minimum  essential coverage.  D. Medicare Eligibility   A commentator noted that the dates in   some of the examples in the proposed  regulations concerning eligibility for  Medicare inaccurately describe when an  individual’s Medicare coverage begins.  The commentator also asked that the  final regulations create a safe harbor for  taxpayers whose Medicare coverage is  delayed because they enroll during the  later months of their Medicare initial  enrollment period.   The final regulations revise the   examples in response to this comment.  The final regulations do not include the  suggested Medicare safe harbor because  the commentator’s concerns are  addressed by the general rule that an  individual is eligible for minimum  essential coverage on the first day of the  first full month the individual may  receive benefits. Additionally, as  discussed earlier in this preamble, the  final regulations revise the rule that an  individual who fails to complete the  requirements to obtain coverage is  treated as eligible on the first day of the  fourth month after the event  establishing eligibility. Thus,  individuals enrolling during the later  months of their initial Medicare  enrollment period will not be deemed  eligible for Medicare before the  expiration of the enrollment period.  E. Indian Health Service   Commentators requested that the final   regulations provide that individuals  eligible to receive health care from the  Indian Health Service (IHS) are not  eligible for government-sponsored  minimum essential coverage. Section  5000A(f) defines minimum essential  coverage. It does not designate the IHS   S E L U R h     t i     w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o     as providing minimum essential  coverage. Section 5000A(f)(1)(E)  authorizes HHS to designate other  coverage as minimum essential  coverage. HHS has advised the IRS and  the Treasury Department that it does not  intend to designate access to the IHS as  minimum essential coverage. Thus,  individuals who are eligible to receive  health care from the IHS will not be  barred by IHS access alone from  eligibility for the premium tax credit or  from access to the special cost-sharing  reduction for tribal members under  section 1402(d) of the Affordable Care  Act.  ii. Employer-Sponsored Coverage  A. Affordability   The proposed regulations provide that   an eligible employer-sponsored plan is  affordable for an employee and related  individuals if the portion of the annual  premium the employee must pay for  self-only coverage does not exceed the  required contribution percentage (9.5  percent for taxable years beginning  before January 1, 2015) of the taxpayer’s  household income. Commentators  suggested that the affordability of  coverage for related individuals should  be based on the portion of the annual  premium the employee must pay for  family coverage.   Under section 36B(c)(2)(C), an   individual who may enroll in an eligible  employer-sponsored plan may  nonetheless be eligible for a premium  tax credit if the employer-sponsored  coverage either is unaffordable or fails  to provide minimum value. Future  regulations concerning employer-  sponsored coverage will provide final  rules on determining affordability for  related individuals and proposed rules  on determining minimum value.   Some commentators asked that the   final rules clarify how employer  contributions to health savings accounts  (HSAs), and amounts made available  under health reimbursement  arrangements (HRAs) are treated in  determining affordability. Employer  contributions to an HSA would not  affect the affordability of employer-  sponsored coverage because HSA  contributions may not be used to pay for  premiums for health insurance coverage  (except in limited circumstances not  applicable in the context of employer-  sponsored coverage). Amounts available  under an HRA that may be used only to  reimburse medical expenses other than  the employee’s required share of the  cost of employer-sponsored coverage  also would not affect the affordability of  employer-sponsored coverage. These  final regulations do not address how   other HRAs are treated for purposes of  determining the affordability of an  employer-sponsored plan, which may  be addressed further in additional  published guidance, see § 601.601(d)(2).   Some commentators also asked for   clarification on how wellness incentive  programs affect the premium  affordability determination. The final  regulations authorize the Commissioner  to publish additional guidance, see  § 601.601(d)(2), to address the effect on  affordability of wellness incentives that  increase or decrease an employee’s  share of premiums. Comments are  requested on types of wellness  incentives, how these programs affect  the affordability of eligible employer-  sponsored coverage for employees and  related individuals, and how incentives  are earned and applied. The  administrability of any rule on wellness  incentives must consider the extent to  which employees can be certain they  will qualify for the incentives at the  time they otherwise would be evaluated  for eligibility for advance credit  payments.  B. Affordability Safe Harbor   Under the proposed regulations, an   employer-sponsored plan is not  affordable for an employee or family  member for a plan year if, when the  employee or family member enrolls in a  qualified health plan, an Exchange  determines that the eligible employer-  sponsored plan is not affordable.  Individuals applying for advance credit  payments are required to provide the  Exchange with information on whether  employer-sponsored coverage is  available to them. Because an Exchange  will make an affordability determination  only when an individual represents that  employer-sponsored coverage is  available, the affordability safe harbor  will not be available to a taxpayer who  misrepresents to an Exchange the  availability of employer-sponsored  coverage. The final regulations provide  that the affordability safe harbor does  not apply if a taxpayer, with reckless  disregard for the facts, provides  incorrect information to an Exchange  concerning an employee’s portion of the  annual premium for employer coverage.  The final regulations clarify that the  affordability safe harbor applies only  until such time as the availability of  employer-sponsored coverage changes.  If new or different employer-sponsored  coverage becomes available after an  individual enrolls in a qualified health  plan, the individual must notify the  Exchange and get a new affordability  determination to extend the safe harbor.  As the preamble to the proposed  regulation notes, regulations under      n o s n b o r s  i  VerDate Mar<15>2010  16:20 May 22, 2012 Jkt 226001 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23MYR1.SGM 23MYR1  Federal  Register / Vol.  77,  No.  100 / Wednesday,  May  23,  2012 / Rules  and  Regulations   30381   section 4980H are expected to provide  that an employer is not subject to a  penalty merely because an employee  receives a premium tax credit under this  affordability safe harbor if the employer  offers to its full-time employees  affordable coverage that provides  minimum value.   Under 45 CFR 155.335, Exchanges   generally will conduct an annual  redetermination process that will allow  individuals who enroll in a qualified  health plan to maintain their eligibility  and enrollment for subsequent years  with limited burden. This process  involves notifying the individual of the  information the Exchange intends to use  to make a new determination of  eligibility for advance credit payments  and soliciting the individual to report  changes. The final regulations clarify  that the affordability safe harbor does  not carry over to later plan years  automatically as part of the  redetermination process. The  affordability safe harbor applies only to  a plan year for which a taxpayer  responds to the notification and  affirmatively provides information  relating to the affordability in the  upcoming year of available employer-  sponsored coverage, allowing an  Exchange to determine that employer-  sponsored coverage available to the  taxpayer for that plan year is  unaffordable.  C. Eligibility During a Waiting Period   Under section 2708 of the Public  Health Service Act, employers are  permitted to apply a waiting period of  up to 90 days beginning when the  employee is otherwise eligible for  coverage under a group health plan. See  Notice 2012–17 (2012–9 IRB 430). The  final regulations clarify that an  employee or related individual is  treated as not eligible for coverage under  the employer’s plan during a waiting  period.  D. Minimum Value   The proposed regulations provide that   an eligible employer-sponsored plan  provides minimum value only if the  plan’s share of the total allowed costs of  benefits provided under the plan is at  least 60 percent. Commentators  provided various recommendations for  determining minimum value. Some  commentators requested transition  relief. Notice 2012–31 (2012–20 IRB  906) solicits additional comments on  potential approaches for determining  minimum value. All comments will be  considered in separate guidance on  determining minimum value.   S E L U R h     t i     w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o     E. Individuals Enrolled in Coverage   Section 36B(c)(2)(C)(iii) and the   proposed regulations provide that an  individual who enrolls in an eligible  employer-sponsored plan is not eligible  for the premium tax credit even if the  plan is unaffordable or fails to offer  minimum value. Commentators asked  whether an individual who enrolls in an  eligible employer-sponsored plan and  then terminates coverage during the  plan year is treated as eligible for  minimum essential coverage under the  plan for the entire plan year under this  rule, even though the coverage is  unaffordable or does not provide  minimum value. Commentators  similarly asked if individuals who  enroll in continuation coverage and  then disenroll from it later during the  year are treated as eligible for minimum  essential coverage for the entire year. In  response to these comments, the final  regulations clarify that an individual is  treated as eligible for minimum  essential coverage under an eligible  employer-sponsored plan by reason of  enrolling in the plan or in continuation  coverage only for months the individual  is enrolled in the coverage.   Commentators expressed concern that   an employee may be enrolled  automatically in employer-sponsored  coverage and would be treated as  eligible for minimum essential coverage  under an employer-sponsored plan by  reason of the automatic enrollment even  though the plan is not affordable or does  not provide minimum value. The  commentators were specifically  concerned about the automatic  enrollment provision in section 18A of  the Fair Labor Standards Act (added by  section 1511 of the Affordable Care Act),  which is applicable to employers with  more than 200 full-time employees.  (The Department of Labor, which has  jurisdiction over the automatic  enrollment provisions under section  18A of the Fair Labor Standards Act,  does not intend to require employers to  comply with the automatic enrollment  provisions until after it publishes  regulations and those regulations  become applicable, and has indicated  that the regulations will not take effect  by 2014. See Notice 2012–17, Q&A–1.)  Commentators also raised concerns  about the automatic enrollment of an  employee in an employer-sponsored  plan for other reasons, which could  include automatic enrollment that a  plan might provide for without regard to  the automatic enrollment requirements  of the Affordable Care Act, automatic  enrollment that might occur because of  administrative error, or automatic re-  enrollment in the plan in a subsequent   year. The commentators recommended  allowing an employee to opt out of the  employer-sponsored coverage following  automatic enrollment.   In response to these comments, the   final regulations provide that an  employee or related individual is  treated as not enrolled in an eligible  employer-sponsored plan for a month in  a plan year or other period if (1) the  employee or related individual is  automatically enrolled in the plan for  that plan year or other period, and (2)  terminates the coverage before the later  of the first day of the second full  calendar month of the plan year or other  period or the last day of any permissible  opt-out period provided by the  employer-sponsored plan or in  regulations to be issued by the  Department of Labor. Thus, an  individual who is automatically  enrolled for a plan year or other period  in coverage that is unaffordable or that  does not provide minimum value and  who terminates that coverage by the  date specified in the preceding sentence  will not be treated as eligible for  minimum essential coverage under the  employer-sponsored plan for the  months in which the individual was  automatically enrolled in the plan that  are within that plan year or period.  Accordingly, the individual will not be  precluded by the automatic enrollment  from inclusion in the taxpayer’s  coverage family for computing the  amount of the premium tax credit for  those months.  iii. Nondependent Eligibility for  Minimum Essential Coverage   Commentators asked whether   individuals who may enroll in an  eligible employer-sponsored plan based  on their relationship to an employee but  who are not tax dependents (for  example, a 25-year old child or a  domestic partner of the employee) are  treated as eligible for minimum  essential coverage under the plan. In  response to these comments, the final  regulations provide that an individual  who may enroll in minimum essential  coverage because of a relationship to  another person eligible for the coverage,  but for whom the other eligible person  does not claim a personal exemption  deduction under section 151, is treated  as eligible for minimum essential  coverage under the coverage only for  months that the related individual is  enrolled in the coverage. This change  reflects the fact that the related  individual is a member of a different  family with different household income  for purposes of the premium tax credit.  Furthermore, a person who may not  claim a related individual as a      n o s n b o r s  i  VerDate Mar<15>2010  16:20 May 22, 2012 Jkt 226001 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23MYR1.SGM 23MYR1  30382   Federal  Register / Vol.  77,  No.  100 / Wednesday,  May  23,  2012 / Rules  and  Regulations   dependent is not responsible for the  section 5000A penalty for the related  individual who does not receive  coverage. Thus, the final regulations  ensure that coverage available through  another person does not create an  obstacle to a related individual claiming  a premium tax credit.  3. Computing the Premium Tax Credit  a. Definition of Coverage Month   Section 36B(c)(2)(A)(ii) and the   proposed regulations provide that a  month is a coverage month for an  individual only if the individual is  enrolled in a qualified health plan and  is not eligible for other minimum  essential coverage on the first day of the  month, and the premiums are paid by  the taxpayer or through advance credit  payments.   Consistent with the proposed  regulations, the final regulations  provide that an individual must be  enrolled in a qualified health plan as of  the first day of the month for a month  to be a coverage month. However,  instead of testing whether the  individual is eligible for other minimum  essential coverage as of the first day of  the month, the final regulations provide  that an individual may have a coverage  month as long as there is at least one  day of the month when the individual  is not eligible for other minimum  essential coverage. The final regulations  also clarify that a month is not a  coverage month for a taxpayer if the  taxpayer’s share of premiums is not paid  in full by the unextended due date for  filing the taxpayer’s income tax return  for the taxable year.  b. Third-Party Payments   Under the proposed regulations,  premiums another person pays for  coverage of the taxpayer or a member of  the taxpayer’s family for a month are  treated as paid by the taxpayer solely for  purposes of the month qualifying as a  coverage month. Commentators asked  for confirmation that an Indian tribe  may pay premiums on behalf of a tribal  member. The final regulations add an  example illustrating that premiums paid  for a taxpayer by an Indian tribe are  treated as paid by the taxpayer under  the coverage month rule.  c. Adjusted Monthly Premium   Under section 36B(b)(3)(C), the  adjusted monthly premium is the  premium an issuer would charge to  cover all members of a taxpayer’s  coverage family, adjusted only for age.  A commentator noted that the definition  of adjusted monthly premium in the  proposed regulations does not include   S E L U R h     t i     w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o     the statutory qualification that, in the  case of a State participating in the  wellness discount demonstration project  under section 2705(d) of the Public  Health Service Act, the adjusted  monthly premium is determined  without regard to any premium discount  or rebate under the project. The final  regulations revise the definition of  adjusted monthly premium in  accordance with this comment and  clarify that the premium may not be  adjusted for tobacco use, see section  36B(b)(3)(C).  d. Applicable Benchmark Plan  i. In General   Under section 36B(b)(3)(B), a  taxpayer’s premium tax credit is  computed based on the premium for the  applicable second lowest cost silver  plan in the rating area where the  taxpayer resides and offered by the  Exchange where the taxpayer enrolls in  a qualified health plan. For simplicity,  the proposed regulations refer to this  plan as the applicable benchmark plan.  Section 36B(b)(3)(B)(ii) describes the   ‘‘applicable’’ benchmark plan as  providing self-only or family coverage.  The proposed regulations define family  coverage as insurance that covers more  than one individual. The proposed  regulations further provide that a  taxpayer’s ‘‘applicable’’ benchmark plan  is the benchmark plan that ‘‘applies’’ to  the members of the taxpayer’s coverage  family. The proposed regulations define  the coverage family, in general, as the  members of the taxpayer’s family (the  individuals for whom the taxpayer  properly claims a personal exemption  deduction under section 151) who are  not eligible for other minimum essential  coverage. The final regulations clarify  that the coverage family includes only  those individuals in the taxpayer’s  family who are not eligible for other  minimum essential coverage and enroll  in a qualified health plan.   For purposes of determining the  benchmark plan that ‘‘applies’’ to a  coverage family, the proposed  regulations provide that if an Exchange  offers categories of family coverage  (such as coverage for two adults or  coverage for one adult plus children),  the applicable benchmark plan for  family coverage is the coverage category  that applies to the members of the  taxpayer’s coverage family who enroll in  a qualified health plan. The final  regulations delete the reference to  coverage categories. The final Exchange  rules promulgated by HHS removed  references to rating categories, which  are a parallel concept to coverage  categories. The final regulations provide   that the applicable benchmark plan for  family coverage is the plan that applies  to the members of the taxpayer’s  coverage family.   Commentators requested clarification  on how the applicable benchmark plan  would be determined for a qualified  health plan that covers children only.  The final regulations provide an  example in response to this comment.  ii. Families Not Covered by One  Applicable Benchmark Plan   The proposed regulations provide that   the premium for the applicable  benchmark plan is the sum of the  premiums for the applicable benchmark  plans that cover components of the  taxpayer’s coverage family if a single  benchmark plan would not cover the  family, for example because members  live in different rating areas. The final  regulations provide that, if there is at  least one silver level plan offered on an  Exchange that does not cover all  members of a taxpayer’s coverage family  under one policy and premium, for  example because of nontraditional  relationships within the family, the  premium for the applicable benchmark  plan is the single premium or the  combination of premiums that is the  second lowest cost silver option for  covering the entire family. The final  regulations reserve rules for determining  the applicable benchmark plan for  families with members residing in  different locations.   Commentators stated that the final   regulations should allow domestic  partners and other two-adult groups to  use a family benchmark plan to  compute their premium tax credit if the  Exchange allows both adults to be  covered by the same qualified health  plan. The final regulations do not adopt  this suggestion. If the adults constitute  two separate households for Federal tax  purposes, section 36B requires a  separate credit computation for each  household that includes only those  individuals for whom each taxpayer  claims a personal exemption deduction  under section 151.  iii. Plans Closed to Enrollment   The proposed regulations provide   that, in general, an applicable  benchmark plan is the second lowest  cost silver plan offered through the  Exchange at the time a taxpayer or  family member enrolls. However, a plan  does not cease to be a taxpayer’s  applicable benchmark plan for that  enrollment period because the plan or a  lower cost plan closes to enrollment  during the taxable year. Thus, a plan  may continue to be an applicable  benchmark plan if it closes to      n o s n b o r s  i  VerDate Mar<15>2010  16:20 May 22, 2012 Jkt 226001 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23MYR1.SGM 23MYR1  30388   Federal  Register / Vol.  77,  No.  100 / Wednesday,  May  23,  2012 / Rules  and  Regulations   as eligible for government-sponsored  minimum essential coverage as of the  first day of the fourth calendar month  following the event that establishes  eligibility.   (iii) Special rule for coverage for   veterans and other individuals under  chapter 17 or 18 of Title 38, U.S.C. An  individual is eligible for minimum  essential coverage under a health care  program under chapter 17 or 18 of Title  38, U.S.C. only if the individual is  enrolled in a health care program under  chapter 17 or 18 of Title 38, U.S.C.  identified as minimum essential  coverage in regulations issued under  section 5000A.   (iv) Retroactive effect of eligibility   determination. If an individual  receiving advance credit payments is  determined to be eligible for  government-sponsored minimum  essential coverage that is effective  retroactively (such as Medicaid), the  individual is treated as eligible for  minimum essential coverage under that  program no earlier than the first day of  the first calendar month beginning after  the approval.   (v) Determination of Medicaid or   Children’s Health Insurance Program  (CHIP) ineligibility. An individual is  treated as not eligible for Medicaid,  CHIP, or a similar program for a period  of coverage under a qualified health  plan if, when the individual enrolls in  the qualified health plan, an Exchange  determines or considers (within the  meaning of 45 CFR 155.302(b)) the  individual to be not eligible for  Medicaid or CHIP.   (vi) Examples. The following   examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (c)(2):   Example 1. Delay in coverage effectiveness.   On April 10, 2015, Taxpayer D applies for  coverage under a government-sponsored  health care program. D’s application is  approved on July 12, 2015, but her coverage  is not effective until September 1, 2015.  Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, D is  eligible for government-sponsored minimum  essential coverage on September 1, 2015.   Example 2. Time of eligibility. Taxpayer E   turns 65 on June 3, 2015, and becomes  eligible for Medicare. Under section  5000A(f)(1)(A)(i), Medicare is minimum  essential coverage. However, E must enroll in  Medicare to receive benefits. E enrolls in  Medicare in September, which is the last  month of E’s initial enrollment period. Thus,  E may receive Medicare benefits on  December 1, 2015. Because E completed the  requirements necessary to receive Medicare  benefits by the last day of the third full  calendar month after the event that  establishes E’s eligibility (E turning 65),  under paragraph (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this  section E is eligible for government-  sponsored minimum essential coverage on  December 1, 2015, the first day of the first   S E L U R h     t i     w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o     full month that E may receive benefits under  the program.   Example 3. Time of eligibility, individual   fails to complete necessary requirements. The  facts are the same as in Example 2, except  that E fails to enroll in the Medicare coverage  during E’s initial enrollment period. E is  treated as eligible for government-sponsored  minimum essential coverage under paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section as of October 1, 2015,  the first day of the fourth month following  the event that establishes E’s eligibility (E  turning 65).   Example 4. Retroactive effect of eligibility.   In November 2014, Taxpayer F enrolls in a  qualified health plan for 2015 and receives  advance credit payments. F loses her part-  time employment and on April 10, 2015  applies for coverage under the Medicaid  program. F’s application is approved on May  15, 2015, and her Medicaid coverage is  effective as of April 1, 2015. Under paragraph  (c)(2)(iv) of this section, F is eligible for  government-sponsored minimum essential  coverage on June 1, 2015, the first day of the  first calendar month after approval.   Example 5. Determination of Medicaid   ineligibility. In November 2014, Taxpayer G  applies through the Exchange to enroll in  health coverage for 2015. The Exchange  determines that G is not eligible for Medicaid  and estimates that G’s household income will  be 140 percent of the Federal poverty line for  G’s family size for purposes of determining  advance credit payments. G enrolls in a  qualified health plan and begins receiving  advance credit payments. G experiences a  reduction in household income during the  year and his household income for 2015 is  130 percent of the Federal poverty line  (within the Medicaid income threshold).  However, under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this  section, G is treated as not eligible for  Medicaid for 2015.   Example 6. Mid-year Medicaid eligibility   redetermination. The facts are the same as in  Example 5, except that G returns to the  Exchange in July 2015 and the Exchange  determines that G is eligible for Medicaid.  Medicaid approves G for coverage and the  Exchange discontinues G’s advance credit  payments effective August 1. Under  paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v) of this  section, G is treated as not eligible for  Medicaid for the months when G is covered  by a qualified health plan. G is eligible for  government-sponsored minimum essential  coverage for the months after G is approved  for Medicaid and can receive benefits,  August through December 2015.   (3) Employer-sponsored minimum  essential coverage—(i) In general. For  purposes of section 36B, an employee  who may enroll in an eligible employer-  sponsored plan (as defined in section  5000A(f)(2)) and an individual who may  enroll in the plan because of a  relationship to the employee (a related  individual) are eligible for minimum  essential coverage under the plan for  any month only if the plan is affordable  and provides minimum value.  Government-sponsored programs  described in section 5000A(f)(1)(A) are  not eligible employer-sponsored plans.   (ii) Plan year. For purposes of this   paragraph (c)(3), a plan year is an  eligible employer-sponsored plan’s  regular 12-month coverage period (or  the remainder of a 12-month coverage  period for a new employee or an  individual who enrolls during a special  enrollment period).   (iii) Eligibility for months during a   plan year—(A) Failure to enroll in plan.  An employee or related individual may  be eligible for minimum essential  coverage under an eligible employer-  sponsored plan for a month during a  plan year if the employee or related  individual could have enrolled in the  plan for that month during an open or  special enrollment period.   (B) Waiting periods. An employee or   related individual is not eligible for  minimum essential coverage under an  eligible employer-sponsored plan  during a required waiting period before  the coverage becomes effective.   (C) Example. The following example   illustrates the provisions of this  paragraph (c)(3)(iii):   Example. (i) Taxpayer B is an employee   of Employer X. X offers its employees a  health insurance plan that has a plan year  (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of  this section) from October 1 through  September 30. Employees may enroll during  an open season from August 1 to September  15. B does not enroll in X’s plan for the plan  year October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2015.  In November 2014, B enrolls in a qualified  health plan through an Exchange for calendar  year 2015.   (ii) B could have enrolled in X’s plan   during the August 1 to September 15  enrollment period. Therefore, unless X’s plan  is not affordable for B or does not provide  minimum value, B is eligible for minimum  essential coverage under X’s plan for the  months that B is enrolled in the qualified  health plan during X’s plan year (January  through September 2015).   (iv) Continuation coverage. An   individual who may enroll in  continuation coverage required under  Federal law or a State law that provides  comparable continuation coverage is  eligible for minimum essential coverage  only for months that the individual is  enrolled in the coverage.   (v) Affordable coverage—(A) In   general—(1) Affordability for employee.  Except as provided in paragraph  (c)(3)(v)(A)(3) of this section, an eligible  employer-sponsored plan is affordable  for an employee if the portion of the  annual premium the employee must  pay, whether by salary reduction or  otherwise (required contribution), for  self-only coverage does not exceed the  required contribution percentage (as  defined in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(C) of this  section) of the applicable taxpayer’s  household income for the taxable year.      n o s n b o r s  i  VerDate Mar<15>2010  16:20 May 22, 2012 Jkt 226001 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23MYR1.SGM 23MYR1

Yet, there has been relatively little attention focused on the type of  coverage that people would have to buy and how much it would cost individuals to  satisfy the so-called “individual mandate.”   This data note provides estimates of the potential cost-sharing levels for plans that  will be available in the non-group market (including in new health insurance  exchanges) when the ACA is fully implemented in 2014.  It builds on previous work  from Kaiser1 and reflects recent guidance from the federal government on benefits  and cost-sharing for plans offered in those markets.   ACA Rules for Benefits and Cost-Sharing   The ACA changes the structure of the non-group market to provide participants  with a defined set of “essential health benefits” with standardized tiers of cost-  sharing.  The law specifies 10 categories of benefits to be included in the essential  health benefit package, and provides that the scope of the package be equal to the  scope of benefits in a typical employer-sponsored plan.   In recent proposed guidance2, the federal government indicated that it plans to give  states the option to choose an essential benefits package from among one of the  following options: one of the three largest products in the small group market in the  state, one of the three largest health plans offered to federal or state employees, or  the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) with the largest commercial  enrollment in the state.  States will need to fill in certain benefits specified by the  ACA that are often not included in benefit plans today, such as habilitation and  pediatric dental services.  The guidance suggests that benefits are not expected to  vary significantly across the different options.  Under the guidance, health plans  would be permitted to adjust the scope of benefits as long as the average benefit  amount remains the same, as measured for a standard population.     In separate proposed guidance3, the federal government described an intended  approach for how “actuarial value” will be determined for the purpose of  establishing the different cost-sharing tiers.  The actuarial value of a plan is the  percentage of covered heath care costs expected to be paid by the plan for a broad  population.   Under the ACA, plans in the non-group and small group markets must  have an actuarial value of 60 percent (bronze plans), 70 percent (silver plans), 80                                                           1 http://www.kff.org/healthreform/8177.cfm  2 http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/Files2/12162011/essential_health_benefits_bulletin.pdf  3 http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/Files2/02242012/Av-csr-bulletin.pdf      April 2012   THE HENRY J.

For example, a bronze plan on  average would pay for 60 percent of the costs for covered benefits and enrollees on  average would pay the remaining 40 percent through cost-sharing such as  deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.   The guidance states that actuarial values will be calculated using a publically- available actuarial value calculator based on claims data that will be weighted to  reflect the expected population in the individual and small group markets.  The  calculator will reflect standard prices and use of services reflecting the population.   Although essential benefits will vary somewhat from state to state, the guidance  states that the variation is very small relative to the total amount of covered  expenses and that the “variation is expected to have limited impact on the plan  [actuarial value].”  Insurers using straightforward designs will be able to calculate  an actuarial value directly from the calculator; insurers with more complex cost- sharing or network designs may need to submit a separate actuarial analysis  estimating the impact of their design on the plan’s actuarial value.     All plans are required to cap patient out-of-pocket costs at a specified level.  Lower- income enrollees are eligible for lower out-of-pocket limits and higher actuarial  value coverage.   Estimates of Patient Cost-Sharing   Because actuarial value is stated as a percentage, it is hard for most people to  understand what cost-sharing in health plans will look like when the new rules take  effect.  To provide a more tangible picture of what coverage people would be  required to buy, the Kaiser Family Foundation commissioned Aon Hewitt, a  prominent benefit consultant, to estimate dollar values for several illustrative cost- sharing structures for non-group bronze and silver level plans when the ACA is fully  implemented in 2014.  Bronze plans are the least comprehensive of the four tiers,  and represent the minimum coverage people purchasing non-group coverage could  buy to satisfy the individual mandate.  Silver plans are likely to be the most common  level of coverage because premium tax credits are based on silver plan premiums  and only people enrolled in silver plans will be eligible for cost-sharing subsidies.   These estimates update previous work and better reflect the federal guidance on  essential health benefits and actuarial value.  A detailed description of the  methodology is provided at the conclusion of the brief.      We present two illustrative cost-sharing designs that were applied to each tier: one  with a deductible and 20 percent patient coinsurance up to an out-of-pocket limit of  $6,350 for an individual, and a second with a smaller deductible and higher patient  coinsurance of 40 percent up to the same out-of-pocket limit.  The deductible and  coinsurance were assumed to apply to all services except preventive services, which  are available under the ACA without patient cost-sharing.  This means that for most  services covered by the plan under these designs, the patient would pay all of the   2   Patient Cost-sharing Under the affordable Care aCt  FOCUS FOCUS  on on  Health Reform Health Reform  cost until the deductible is reached, and either 20 percent or 40 percent (depending  on the option) of any additional costs until total patient cost-sharing reaches the  out-of-pocket limit.  Under the ACA, out-of-pocket limits for health plans are subject  to the limit that currently applies to health savings account-qualified health plans,  which is $6,050 for single coverage in 2012, and we estimate it to be $6,350 in 2014.   The results are shown in Table 1.  All amounts are for coverage of a single individual  under a preferred provider organization (PPO) plan. Deductibles and out-of-pocket  limits would be double these amounts for families.   A bronze plan with 20 percent coinsurance – a typical level under coverage today –  and an out-of-pocket cost-sharing limit of $6,350 would have a single deductible of  $4,375.  Increasing the patient coinsurance level to 40 percent would lower the  deductible by $900 to $3,475.  Under both scenarios the deductibles are significant  and would be considered catastrophic plans, particularly for people without  significant personal savings.  These plans would also meet the requirements for tax- preferred Health Savings Accounts.   The deductibles are more modest for silver plans with the same coinsurance and  out-of-pocket limits.  A silver plan with 20 percent coinsurance and an out-of-pocket  cost-sharing limit of $6,350 would have a deductible of $2,050.  Increasing the  patient coinsurance level to 40 percent would lower the deductible to $650.

Coverage with cost-sharing levels comparable to current employer-based plans will  be available through gold (actuarial value of 80 percent) and platinum (actuarial  value of 90 percent) plans. The estimated actuarial value of typical employer- sponsored coverage is over 80 percent4, with coverage offered by small employers  generally less comprehensive.                                                            4 http://www.kff.org/medicare/7768.cfm     Deductible  $4,375  $3,475  $2,050  $650   Patient Cost-sharing Under the affordable Care aCt   3  FOCUS  on  Health Reform  However, the minimum coverage people will be required to buy starting in 2014  will have much higher cost-sharing than typical employer-based coverage and than  the average purchased now in the non-group market. With standard 20 percent  coinsurance, a bronze plan would have an estimated deductible of $4,375 for a  single individual and double that for a family. This compares with an average single  deductible of $2,498 in 2010 in the non-group market5 and an average of $675 in  employer-sponsored PPO plans with deductibles in 2011. Deductibles in employer  plans paired with tax-preferred savings accounts averaged $1,908 in 2011.6   With much of the controversy over the ACA focusing on the individual mandate, it is  noteworthy that the minimum coverage requirement is for insurance that is  significantly less generous (and with a lower premium) than what most people have  today. It is a level of coverage that most would consider catastrophic, providing  protection in the event of an expensive illness while subjecting routine expenses  (except for preventive care) to a relatively high deductible. While much of the  opposition to the individual mandate is likely due to views about the appropriate  role of government, a better understanding of how it works and what it requires  could moderate some of the resistance to it.   People will have the option of buying more generous coverage than the minimum  required, and lower-income enrollees will be eligible for cost-sharing subsidies that  decrease their out-of-pocket costs. But, some may still find themselves with  insurance that requires substantial cost-sharing. Policymakers will face the  challenge over time of finding the right balance between the minimum level of  insurance people should be required to have and providing an appropriate level of  protection.                                                                     5 http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/8077.cfm  6 http://ehbs.kff.org/   4   Patient Cost-sharing Under the affordable Care aCt  FOCUS  FOCUS  on  Health Reform  on  Health Reform  on  Methodology   FOCUS Health Reform     This data note was written by Gary Claxton and Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation.  Actuarial estimates were prepared by Ian Stark, FSA, MAAA of Aon Hewitt.   All estimates are based on the average 2011 premium for a PPO-type plan under employer- sponsored coverage, using an average population of people under age 65 covered by an employer  plan. The gross claims distribution of health expenditures was developed based on a single adult  premium of $5,584 (from the Kaiser/HRET Employer Health Benefits Survey), as well as  assumptions that the typical employer-sponsored PPO plan has an actuarial value of 82 percent  and that 10 percent of premiums are related to administration and profit.  Additionally, premiums  are expected to grow 7.5% annually from 2011 to 2014.   The most recent guidance from the federal government on the definition of actuarial value (AV)  for qualified health plans in the individual and small group markets was taken into account as part  of this analysis.  In brief, the guidance has suggested providing an AV calculator with a limited  number of inputs based on a single dataset of health expenditures with the ability to adjust the  dataset based on demographic or (limited) geographic variation.  While plans were developed to  achieve an AV as close to 60% and 70% as possible, the bulletin recommends a +/- 2% corridor in  certifying plans for each tier.  Finally, it was proposed that employer-funded Health  Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) and Health Savings Account (HSA) contributions could be  included as part of the actuarial value but only to the extent that the funds would be expected to  be utilized for claims payment during the plan year.   Given the single national dataset proposed for the AV calculator, we did not make any adjustments  for non-standard state-mandated essential health benefits (EHB), such as in-vitro fertilization or  autism therapy, as the potential cost impact of those additional benefits are likely to be small and  within the 2 percent corridor. The bulletin states that “although the benchmark for EHB will vary  by state, that variation is expected to have limited impact on plan AV.”   The age distribution of the non-group and small group population – including the currently  uninsured who would not be eligible for Medicaid – is similar to those who now have employer- sponsored insurance. Basing plan designs on that population would not vary the results  significantly, particularly given the 2% corridor proposed in the bulletin.   The estimates do not account for cost-sharing subsidies available for people in silver plans with  incomes up to 250 percent of the poverty level, which increase the actuarial value of the coverage.   All results are in 2014 dollars and are national estimates.  States estimates may be different if  states create an actuarial calculator based on state costs or if the national actuarial value  calculator can be adjusted to account for state-specific costs.

This summary is preliminary, does not reflect the full report, and was prepared as an information update  to supplement the May 13, 2011 Commission meeting. This summary may not otherwise be copied or reproduced in any form  without the consent of  the City and may only be provided to other parties in its entirety.             The primary purpose of  this preliminary summary is to illustrate the dimension of  the potential City obligation if  the current  retiree health program “The Settlement Plan” were amended to be continued for various categories of  current and future retirees.   Multiple economic scenarios were selected to illustrate the sensitivity of  the liabilities to changes in the discount and health care  trend  rates.  The  selected  scenarios  are  intended  to  be  illustrative,  and  do  not  reflect  the  entire  universe  of   possible  future  economic  circumstances.    Demographic  assumptions  remain  the  same  as  those  indicated  in  the  Annual  Accounting  Valuation  prepared for the City of  Chicago’s financial reporting under GASB 45. We believe the assumptions and methods used are within  the range of  possible assumptions that are reasonable and appropriate for the purposes for which they have been used.  Results  shown in this summary could be materially different from the actual outcome if  actual experience differs from the assumptions  used.              The basic measurements shown in this summary reflect the requirements of  Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB)  Statement #45 may not be applicable for other purposes.   To reflect the value of  anticipated Medicare D reimbursement (which  cannot be reflected as an offset under GASB 45), the value of  future payments has been separately presented.             The  undersigned  actuaries  meet  the  Qualification  Standards  of   the  American  Academy  of   Actuaries  to  render  the  actuarial   opinions.

22819`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/AuditInformation/Audit_Process_Overview_Final_Finance.pdf`Success`Success`5`5`Not a fillable PDF.`   Audit Overview   Chicago Department of Finance   Tax Audit Process    There are various ways a business gets selected for audit. The most common are referrals from  another division of the Department of Finance, referral from another City Department, information  obtained during another audit, referral from another business or competitor, referral from another  government agency under an information exchange agreement, selection based on analysis of  information contained in a filed tax return or random selection from registered taxpayers.   If a business is selected for audit, the authorized representative of the taxpayer will be contacted  by an auditor and audit commencement date set.   The auditor will explain generally how the  business was selected for audit, however if a referral was made the specifics of the referral may  not be divulged.  The specific tax types and audit periods to be reviewed will be explained during  this initial contact.  An audit notice will also be sent denoting the taxes and periods under audit,  the date, the time and the location where the audit will take place and taxpayer records and  documents that maybe required at the start of the audit.     Many variables affect the time required to complete an audit. Generally, a taxpayer can expect an  audit to extend over a three to four-month period with the auditor spending approximately three to  four weeks at the audit site in total.    Guidelines for Retaining Records   All business records should be retained for any period for which the Department of Finance can  issue a Tax Determination and Assessment, as per the Statute of Limitations outlined in section  3-4-120 of the Uniform Revenue Procedures Ordinance (URPO).  Certain exceptions to this rule  may apply wherein the municipal code authorizes record destruction if approval is granted by the  City Comptroller.   Once selected for audit or during the course of an audit a taxpayer may be asked to sign a  consent to waive the statute of limitations waiver allowing the Department additional time to  conduct or complete an audit.  This occurs when the date when the statute of limitations would  run on the department's right to issue a tax determination and assessment is approaching or will  pass before the audit is completed.  The statute waiver allows the Department additional time to  complete the audit and during this time period no additional l interest will accrue on any tax  liability.      Taxpayer Responsibilities   •  Maintaining books and records    Every taxpayer and tax collector shall keep accurate books and records of its business or  activity, including original source documents and books of entry denoting the transactions  that gave rise, or may have given rise, to any tax liability, exemption or deduction. All  such books and records shall be kept in the English language and, at all times during  business hours of the day, shall be subject to and available for inspection by the  Department.          •  Duty to produce documents    If, during an audit or investigation, any taxpayer or tax collector fails to make its books  and records available for inspection to the Department, then the Comptroller may serve  written notice by United States registered or certified mail or by personal service on the  person being audited or investigated to produce the requested documents within 45 days  from the date the notice is received. The Comptroller may extend the 45-day time limit.    If the taxpayer or tax collector fails to provide the documents requested in subsection A of  this section within the time so provided, then:    o  The Comptroller may issue a tax determination and assessment based on the  o  The Comptroller may issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of any person   best estimate of the person's tax liability, or    o   having personal knowledge of any relevant facts and may issue subpoenas  duces tecum for the production of books, records, papers or memoranda.   In addition, the Comptroller may issue a citation for each day beyond the 45-day  time limit, or extension thereof, that the documents are not tendered and may  request the City's Corporation Counsel to bring, or cause to be brought, an action  to impose fines for disobeying or refusing to comply with a request made under  this section. Fines shall be as provided for in Section 3-4-310 of this chapter.    Audit Process Steps   Step 1: Opening Conference   The actual audit field work begins with an opening conference with the taxpayer’s representative.  At this conference the auditor develops a thorough understanding of the business’ activities, their  accounting system and the books and records maintained by the business. The duration and  detail of this conference depend in large part upon the complexity of the businesses activities and  the volume of detailed records maintained. The information obtained at this meeting will directly  affect the direction and extent of the audit approach.    If a business will be represented by an Attorney or Accountant not directly employed by the  business, a Power of Attorney form must be executed by an authorized business representative  authorizing such individual(s) before the Auditor can discuss specific details of the audit with  them.      Step 2: Sampling Methods   After the opening conference the auditor will test the accounting system to ensure that  procedures are in place as explained by the taxpayer and he or she will determine those areas  which require further detailed testing.   The auditor will use his or her best judgment in formulating  the audit approach to determine the level of compliance with each tax type under review. Many  factors must be considered in determining the best approach.               Factors such as the availability of complete and accurate books and records, volume and  materiality of transactions, previous enforcement action with the business and accounting  practices of the business all will have a notable effect on the approach. Two basic audit sampling  methods used by the Department are judgmental sampling and statistical sampling. Before  beginning the review of the books and records, the auditor will present the taxpayer with an Audit  Method Election Form outlining the audit approach they have selected.    Judgmental Sampling:    The majority of the audits conducted by the Department are done using a form of judgmental  sampling whereby the auditor identifies and reviews test periods from within the audit period and  the results from these test periods are extrapolated over the remainder of the audit period. This  technique involves the auditor judgmentally selecting periods or sequences for review (months,  quarters, weeks, days or sequences of invoices) and reviewing all items in that sample period or  sequence. This approach is slightly less accurate however the costs associated with performing  this type of test are significantly less to both the taxpayer and the City than those of a statistical  test. The most important factor with such a sample is to select a sample period which is  representative of the entire audit period.    Statistical Sampling    This approach requires significantly more time and effort than judgmental sampling; however, it  will result in a more accurate result. Obviously a statistically valid approach is the preferred  methodology. However, certain conditions must exist for this approach to be followed. Most  important, complete and accurate books and records for the entire audit period must be available.  For an audit to be statistically valid, every transaction must have an equal chance of being  selected. Generally this presents a tremendous burden on a business and statistical sampling  may not be the best method. If complete and accurate records are available the auditor should  seriously consider the feasibility of performing a statistical test, particularly if a taxpayer prefers  such an approach. Despite the accuracy resulting from a statistically valid test, the burdens and  costs associated with such a test usually outweigh the benefit.   Step 3: Audit Method Election Form   Before beginning the review of the detailed information, the auditor will present the taxpayer with  an Audit Method Election Form outlining the audit approach they have selected. The auditor will  also solicit that taxpayer's opinion on the audit approach selected or any possible alternative. The  taxpayer's concerns are either incorporated into the approach or reasons why they cannot are  provided. The taxpayer and the auditor then sign off on the form confirming that we explained the  approach. If the taxpayer refuses to sign the form, the audit supervisor must review the audit  program and election form to determine what, in their judgment, is the best approach. The audit  will then proceed based upon the supervisor’s decision. In these cases, after the detailed audit  work has been completed, the supervisor will again consider all factors influencing their decision  to confirm that the approach was sound. If anything occurred which would render the test non- representative or unreasonable, further testing may need to be done. Occasionally an actual  review will be the best or only way to determine the level of compliance with a tax ordinance; in  these cases an audit method election form is not required.            Step 4: Closing Conference   Pursuant to section 3-4-150 F. a closing conference takes place after the audit has been  completed and the audit file has been reviewed and approved by the audit supervisor.  A closing  conference will generally be held 20 calendar days prior to the issuance of a notice of tax  determination and assessment by the Department of Finance.   At the closing conference the taxpayer will be provided with a complete copy of the audit file and  a Report of Field Collection of Audit Determined Liabilities. The auditor will go over the  workpapers with the taxpayer and answer any questions they may have. The only exception to  this is taxpayers located out of the area where the copy of the file and Report of Field Collection  are sent by certified mail. The closing discussions take place via telephone after the file has been  reviewed by the taxpayer’s representative.    There are two possible ways the audit file can progress:    1.  The taxpayer will be given an opportunity to close the case out by signing off on a Report   of Field Collection of Audit Determined Liabilities, signing all tax returns that were due  during the audit period and remitting the full amount of tax and interest computed due  within twenty days of the closing conference. All applicable penalties are waived under  the Field Collection Report.     If a taxpayer has additional information which would impact the results of the audit or they  identify an error in the file the twenty days may be extended and those adjustments will  be made. At that time, revised tax returns will be generated. The taxpayer will then be  expected to sign the Report of Field Collection, tax returns and make the required  remittance immediately. If a taxpayer needs additional time to comply with the terms of  this offer, those requests should be directed to the Audit Supervisor or Manager. When  resolving any audit determined liability via the Filed Collection process two requisites  must be addressed;    The taxpayer must compute and file amended returns for any periods  subsequent to the audit period where liability exists or provide an acceptable  explanation as to why no additional liability exists for that tax type.  If the  taxpayer has implemented corrective procedures to address the areas of liability  before this agreement, a Post-Audit Compliance Affidavit must be filed explaining  those corrective measures taken.  The taxpayer must have resolved any non-tax debts due the City of Chicago.   i.   ii.      2.   If the taxpayer disagrees with the audit findings or refuses the Report of Field Collection  offer, a Notice of Tax Determination and Assessment is issued which will include all  applicable tax penalties. The taxpayer then has thirty-five days from the date they receive  the assessment to file a written protest and petition for hearing.  A copy of the protest  form, the Department Administrative Hearing rules and a taxpayer’s statement of rights  are provided to the taxpayer at the closing conference. The statement of rights outlines  the rights of taxpayers and tax collectors as well as the obligations of the department as  they relate to the tax determination and assessment that was issued.          Step 5: Settlement Process    When a protest form is filed timely, prehearing conferences and hearing dates are scheduled by  the Department of Administrative Hearings.  In the pre-hearing conferences, informal discussions  are held on any relevant issues including any proposed corrections to the assessment, reasons  for waivers or compromises and all other matters relating to the possible settlement or resolution  of the assessment.     If a taxpayer is unable to pay its tax assessment in a lump sum or is experiencing financial  difficulties, they can request a payment plan or file a financial hardship application with the  Department of Revenue Financial Hardship Committee via the City Comptroller’s Office.  The  standard terms of a payment plan require a 30% down payment with a 12-month term.  Payment  plans include the accrual of interest on the outstanding tax balance at a rate of 12% interest per  annum.   Step 6: Taxpayer Audit Evaluation     At  the  conclusion  of  an  audit  with  the  Chicago  Department  of  Finance,  the  taxpayer  will  be  provided an Audit Evaluation Form and offered an opportunity to provide feedback on the audit  process and Department personnel.  The taxpayer comments on the Audit Evaluation Form will  be utilized by the Department to evaluate its operations and will have a direct impact on future  audits.

The Department seeks to minimize  the burden of the audit process and improve the efficient use of audit resources by  implementing a program whereby taxpayers take an active role in the audit process.      The purpose of the managed audit is to provide a thorough education to the taxpayer on each  tax type covered by the program with less of a disruption to the taxpayer than a standard  audit might involve.  Our goal is to create a relationship with each taxpayer whereby that  taxpayer’s overall compliance with all City taxes is improved.      A managed audit is an audit performed by the taxpayer, under the direction and guidance of  the Department of Finance, pursuant to a formal written agreement outlining the duties and  obligations of each party.  The auditor will provide specific written instructions for the  taxpayer and will review the work of the taxpayer.  This program is an alternative to the  standard audit and provides incentives for taxpayers.  The program will reduce the average  hours required to complete an audit and will assist the Department in administering and  enforcing taxes more efficiently.      This program will provide benefits to the taxpayer and the Department.  By allowing  taxpayers the opportunity to be directly involved in the review of their books and records,  they will better understand the specific applications of the taxes to their operations, possibly  identify operational processes that require modification, and receive penalty and/or interest  waivers on the resulting liability.  The Department will benefit from the program by freeing  auditor time to pursue other enforcement matters with other taxpayers.                                                   Managed Audit Process    Department of Finance management will evaluate cases, individually, to identify specific  cases for managed audits.    Auditors will conduct opening conferences with business representatives to understand  accounting systems and available records, determine whether the taxpayer is a candidate for a  managed audit. And discuss the managed audit process and procedures with the authorized  business representatives to insure that they understand what is required and what benefits  they will receive.    Auditors will prepare a managed audit agreement, including a detailed explanation of the  specific audit steps of the audit that the taxpayer will be completing establish deadlines  providing specific dates by which the taxpayer will have its audit work completed, present  the agreement to the audit supervisor for his/her approval before presenting it to the taxpayer,  and discuss processes and procedures for requesting additional time to complete audit work.      Auditors will review and/or test taxpayers’ worksheets and summary schedules.    The completed audit will be submitted for supervisor review as if it were a regular audit, and  it will go through the normal review and point clearance process.     Auditors will prepare amended returns and validate liability for each period under review.    Auditors will process all penalty and interest waivers pursuant to the Managed Audit  Agreement.      A closing conference will be held with the taxpayer where copies of the audit file are  provided to the taxpayer along with amended returns for approval and authorized signatures  of the taxpayer.      Although full payment of audit-determined liability is expected, payment plans can be  entered.  Although the program provides for interest waivers on audit determined liabilities,  interest accrues throughout the payment plan term on the full amount of tax outstanding.                                             Audit Methodology, Sampling and Workpapers    The methodology used to compute or otherwise determine the amount due or level of  compliance will be discussed before any detailed work is undertaken.  The methodology will  be documented and agreed upon before the detailed work is started to insure that both parties  understand what work needs to be done and how it will be summarized.  The approach used  will be very similar to that used by the Department during the course of any other audit.   Sample periods can be utilized when circumstances warrant and actual reviews of entire audit  periods can also be conducted if necessary.  Sample periods will be identified and agreed  upon by both parties.    The Department will provide workpaper templates for use in documenting the audit findings.   These templates are intended to provide taxpayers with a guide of how the detail is to be  summarized.  Fluctuations from the standard templates are acceptable but should be  discussed before hand.  The objective is to have the audit work summarized in such a manner  that the auditor can efficiently review the work to verify that the liabilities, if any, have been  computed correctly.  If the taxpayer has suggestions or recommendations that it believes will  achieve the objective yet require less time, those concerns should be raised directly with the  auditor.      At the conclusion of the detailed work, the auditor will meet with the taxpayer to review the  schedules compiled and perform a limited verification of the records reviewed and  summarized.  Once satisfied that all testing was done to his/her satisfaction, the auditor will  present the file to his/her supervisor for final review.  No payments are required or expected  until after the supervisor has accepted and approved the audit.  In the event that something is  incomplete or not completed to the satisfaction of the supervisor, the auditor may need to  revisit the business to obtain explanations or additional records.  After supervisory approval  has been secured, amended tax returns will be generated using the audit-determined findings,  and taxpayers will sign and file those returns, which will include all agreed penalty and  interest waivers.  Settlements must be either within pre-approved parameters or specifically  approved by the appropriate supervisors within the Departments of Finance and Law.                                                 Managed Audit Agreements    A managed audit agreement (MAA) is an agreement between the Department of Finance and  a taxpayer that specifies an agreed-upon methodology for calculating and remitting a tax.   Many state and local taxing jurisdictions across the United States are utilizing some form of  MAA to improve their efficiency and overall effectiveness.      Increased demand for greater efficiencies in government has prompted many taxing  authorities to consider alternatives to improve overall compliance levels.  The traditional  audit has been the most common tool used in tax enforcement.  The MAA will enhance that  process by involving taxpayers in their own audits.  In addition to an elimination and/or  reduction of penalties and interest, taxpayers will also benefit from an MAA because it will  allow them an opportunity to analyze their own business operations and possibly identify  areas where changes can be made to make their own operations more effective and compliant  with City taxes.      Eligibility for program    A taxpayer’s inclusion in an MAA is based on its willingness and ability to participate.   Generally the Department will consider entering into an MAA with taxpayers who have  maintained an acceptable system of business records, cooperated with any previous tax  enforcement efforts of the Department and demonstrated a willingness and ability to comply  with the tax laws.      Taxpayers with whom the Department may decline to enter into an MAA include those who  have failed to cooperate in past audits, those who have failed to remedy improper reporting  practices identified in a prior audit, those who have been or currently are the subject of  ongoing criminal investigations, or those who maintain poor internal controls or inadequate  systems of business records.      The Department will negotiate in a spirit of cooperation for a methodology and agreement  that will meet the needs of both parties.                                 Chicago Department of Finance   MANAGED AUDIT AGREEMENT                This managed audit agreement (MAA”) is entered into between the Chicago Department of  Finance (“Department”) and                                                                                (“Taxpayer”),  to conduct a managed audit of the ____________________________Tax for the period   of                                 through                          .          The parties agree to the following:    1.  The Taxpayer will review appropriate books and records as determined by the audit plan.  This review will identify unreported transactions and/or receipts for the above period and  should be completed within                   days from the signing of this agreement.   Amendments to this time frame during the course of the audit may be necessary to facilitate  completion.  All records, work papers and computations will be made available to the  Department for verification.     2.  The Department agrees to accept upon verification, for assessment purposes, the  taxpayer’s determination of unreported transactions, receipts and/or tax.  If the Taxpayer  complies with the audit plan and all other provisions of the MAA, the Department will (a)  waive all penalties, and (b) waive half of the interest computed due, with the waiver of  interest limited to a maximum amount of $20,000.     3.  The Department has provided written procedural guidelines to be included as part of this  audit which specify the portion(s) of the audit that the Taxpayer is to conduct.  This guidance  includes the general scope of the audit, specific records expected to be reviewed, specific test  periods or methodologies to be used, layout of appropriate schedules and other technical  information necessary to complete the review as detailed in the audit plan.  The Department  will be available for ongoing consultation during the audit as issues or concerns develop.      4.  The Department will arrange a closing conference with the Taxpayer to provide the results  of the audit.  At that time the Taxpayer will receive the final tax determination reports,  including copies of all work papers compiled during the audit and tax returns for review,  signature and payment.    5.  It is agreed that in the event the Taxpayer fails to fulfill the terms of this agreement, the  Department will conduct the audit.  Any change in liability will be based on all available  information and may include any completed audit work of the Taxpayer and/or the  Department.

Following are answers to questions that you may have about the program.  If  you have any unanswered questions please discuss those with the auditor or audit supervisor handling your  case.      What is a Managed Audit?    A managed audit is basically a self-audit conducted by the taxpayer with limited Assistance from the City  auditor.  Once a business has been selected for audit, the auditor evaluates whether the business is a candidate  for a managed audit.  Initially the program will include non-titled use tax, employers expense tax, ground  transportation tax and MPEA airport departure tax.      Once a taxpayer is determined to be eligible, the auditor will discuss the process with the taxpayer and if the  taxpayer is willing and able to perform the audit, the auditor will draft an audit program and managed audit  agreement.  These documents will set forth the specific audit methodology to be used, the audit period, the  deadlines for the audit work and all other issues surrounding the waivers and final review by the auditor.     Can any business perform a managed audit?    While businesses already targeted for audit will be offered the managed audit, any business wanting to  participate may contact the Department and become part of the program.  Generally these businesses file a  voluntary disclosure; however, the managed audit program offers an additional interest savings and includes  more involvement by the Department auditors in designing the audit approach and reviewing the final work  papers.    A managed audit is most appropriate when the auditor has determined that there are multiple, clear-cut  taxability issues, business records are available, and the taxpayer has the ability time and understanding to  follow the audit instructions.     How does a business benefit by performing a managed audit?    By participating in the managed audit program taxpayers not only avoid penalties and a portion of the interest  due, but also avoid being inconvenienced when the auditors are on site performing the review.  Businesses can  work at their own pace within established timeframes, and taxpayers gain education and experience regarding  the audit process and the application of the tax to their business operations.  Performing the detailed audit  work may also identify system or accounting problems or issues that the business may not otherwise have  known about     What happens if the taxpayer refuses to perform the managed audit or fails to fulfill the terms of the  managed audit agreement?    In either case, the auditor will conduct or complete the audit and may use any work papers which may have  been compiled to date, if useful.

22831`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxSupportingInformation/NontitledUseTaxInfoBulletinforContractors.pdf`Success`Success`1`1`Not a fillable PDF.`                    DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE   INFORMATIONAL BULLETIN   Use Tax for Nontitled Personal Property   Construction Contractors     The purpose of this bulletin is to provide  construction contractors with information  regarding their obligation to pay the  Chicago Use Tax for Nontitled Personal  Property (“Use Tax”), chapter 3-27 of the  Municipal Code of Chicago.      General Information  The Use Tax is imposed upon the privilege  of using nontitled tangible personal  property in the city which is purchased at  retail from a retailer located outside the  city. The Use Tax is one percent of the  property's purchase or cost price.  The Use  Tax is imposed, and the obligation to pay  is upon the purchaser or end user of  nontitled tangible personal property.      When a construction contractor  permanently affixes tangible personal  property to real property, the  contractor is deemed the end user of  that tangible personal property.  As the  end user, the contractor incurs Use Tax  on the cost price of that tangible  personal property.    Tools, equipment, fuel and lumber for  forms purchased outside the city and used  in the city are subject to the Use Tax.     The term construction contractor includes  general contractors, subcontractors, and  specialized contractors including but not  limited to landscape, electrical, masonry,  and plumbing contractors.  (Regulation  130.1940 promulgated under the Retailers’  Occupation Tax, 35 ILCS 120/1 et seq.)    Annual Tax Credit  Every taxpayer is entitled to an annual  credit of $25 to be applied against the  taxpayer’s aggregate Use Tax liability for  each taxable year.      Other Credits  To prevent multiple taxation, a taxpayer  who purchases nontitled tangible personal  property for use in the city from a retailer  located outside the city may take a credit  equal to any municipal tax actually paid  that was properly due to another  municipality in any state with respect  purchase or use of the property.  If such  tax is rebated, no credit is allowed.        Depreciation for Out-of-City Use  If nontitled tangible personal property is  used outside the city before being used in  the city, for purposes of computing Use  Tax, its purchase price may be reduced by  an amount representing a reasonable  allowance for depreciation attributable to  the period of out-of-city use. Depreciation  shall be determined by using the straight  line method of depreciation, and an item’s  useful life shall be as provided in the U.S.  Internal Revenue Code, as amended.  Depreciation shall be calculated on a  monthly basis with no adjustment for  fractions of a month.      Exempt Uses  Temporary storage of nontitled tangible  personal property in the city that is  acquired outside the city and subsequently  used solely outside the city is exempt.      Purchases of materials for incorporation  into real estate owned by charitable,  religious, or educational institutions or  organizations or by governmental bodies  are exempt.      Note: Purchases of items that are not  incorporated into real estate such as tools,  fuel and lumber for forms are taxable  purchases regardless of the exempt status  of the contractor’s customer.       How is the tax calculated?  The Use Tax is 1% of the purchase price  for all items of nontitled tangible personal  property purchased at retail from a retailer  located outside the city and used in the  city.     How do I register for the tax?    Applications can be found at            www.cityofchicago.org/finance in the Tax  Collection and Enforcement section.     When are payments due?  Use Tax due should be remitted on or  before the fifteenth day following the end  of the monthly tax period in which the  liability was incurred.             When is the tax return due?  The tax return for the fiscal year, July 1st  through June 30th, is filed annually and is   due by August 15th  of each year.    Contractor Use Tax Examples  Example 1  A construction contractor purchases steel  and lumber from a supplier located in  Indiana to be used to construct an office  building in the city. The construction  contractor is liable for Use Tax on the  purchase price of the steel and lumber.     Example 2  A plumbing contractor purchases cast iron  pipe from a supplier in Bedford Park to be  used on a job for the Chicago Transit  Authority.  At the same time, the  contractor also purchases a propane torch  and a pipe wrench to use on the job.  The  contractor does not owe Use Tax on the  purchase price of the cast iron pipe  because the purchase will be incorporated  into real estate owned by an exempt  governmental entity.  However, the  contractor does owe Use Tax on the  purchase price of the tools that he will use  on the job.      Example 3  An electrical contractor purchases wiring,  pliers, and a voltage detector from a  retailer in the city to use on a job in the  city.  The contractor does not owe Use Tax  on this purchase because the purchase was  made from a retailer located in the city,  and the retailer should charge tax on the  purchase price.

No, regardless of the form that the transfer takes – be it sale of stock in the cooperative with a lease, a transfer of a beneficial interest in a land trust that owns the cooperative interest, or otherwise - the transfer is considered a taxable transaction and subject to the Transfer Tax.  Does it matter that a controlling interest in the cooperative is not transferred?  No, taxability does not require that a controlling interest in a cooperative (e.g., 50 percent of the shares of a cooperative)  be transferred.  The transfer of a single share of stock in a cooperative is considered a taxable transaction and subject to the Transfer Tax.  Does it matter that the instrument of transfer of the cooperative interest was not recorded?  No, the Transfer Tax is due upon the earlier of the transfer of the interest in the cooperative or the recording of the instrument of transfer of the interest in the cooperative (e.g., the lease, stock transfer, or assignment).  See Code Section 3-33-030(B)(1).  The unintentional or purposeful omission to record such document does not affect the applicability of the Transfer Tax.  How much tax is due on a transfer?  As of the date of this bulletin, the tax rate is $5.25 per $500.00 of the transfer price, or fraction thereof, for the transfer of an interest in a cooperative.  The buyer is responsible for $3.75   which is the “City portion” and the seller is responsible for $1.50 which is the “C.T.A. portion.”  Please refer to the Code and to the Department’s website for current tax rate information and other details.  The Department’s website address is:  www.cityofchicago.org/revenue  Are there any penalties and interest that apply to unfiled declarations or unpaid taxes?  Generally, the Transfer Tax is due when the transfer occurs.  See Code Section 3-33-020.  When the Transfer Tax is not timely paid, interest accrues on the unpaid tax, and penalties are often assessed.  If no Transfer Tax Form (Form 7551) was filed at the time of the transfer, a penalty equal to 100% of the amount of the Transfer Tax is due.  Code Section 3-33-110.  If the failure to pay the Transfer Tax is determined to have been negligent or willful, a penalty of 25% of the tax is due.  Code Section 3-4-220.  What should I do if I have failed to pay the  Transfer Tax upon the transfer of my cooperative?  If you discover that you have unpaid tax and enter our voluntary disclosure program, applicable penalties will be waived.  However, if you fail to voluntarily disclose tax owed and you are discovered by the Department, all applicable penalties noted above will apply.  For more information on voluntary disclosure please visit our website at: www.cityofchicago.org/revenue.  TO:  Owners of     real estate                         cooperatives: The purpose of this informational bulletin is to discuss specific issues identified by the Department of Revenue (the “Department) relating to the Chicago Real Property Transfer Tax (the “Transfer Tax”), chapter 3-33 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (the “Code”), as it relates to transfers of interests in real estate cooperatives (“cooperatives”).  What is a real estate cooperative?  Generally, a cooperative is a corporation, the stockholders of which are entitled to occupy an apartment in a building owned or leased by such corporation.  Often the owner of such stock receives from the corporation a lease of a particular apartment or unit in the building.   Is the transfer of a cooperative interest taxable under the Chicago Real Property Transfer Tax Ordinance?  Yes, the transfer of an interest in a cooperative is subject to the  Transfer Tax.  Under the Code, the Transfer Tax is imposed upon the privilege of transferring title to, or beneficial interest in, real property located in the City.  Code Section 3-33-020.  An interest in a cooperative is considered a beneficial interest in real property.  See Chicago Department of Revenue Real Property Transfer Tax Ruling #1 (April 28, 1994; republished June 1, 2004).  Accordingly, the transfer of such interest is subject to the Transfer Tax.

Please refer to the ordinance and regulations for exact terms.     What is the tax rate?  Please refer to the Chicago Department of Revenue website for current tax rate information.  Our web address is:  www.cityofchicago.org/revenue  How do I know if my establishment is subject to the Restaurant Tax?  Two criteria must be met in order for your establishment to be subject to the Restaurant Tax.    1.  The establishment must sell food prepared for immediate consumption.  Generally, this refers to food made ready by the retailer to be eaten without substantial delay after the final stage of preparation. 2.  The establishment must provide for on- premises consumption.  Generally, this means that the business provides accommodations for eating the food on the premises, regardless of whether or not the food is actually eaten on the premises.  If your establishment meets both criteria then your business is subject to the Restaurant Tax.  Unless you meet the  requirements for “mixed facilities or operations” (see Restaurant Tax   Regulations Part 5), the tax applies to the selling price of all non-exempt food and beverages (both alcoholic and non- alcoholic) that your establishment sells at retail.  What are considered to be accommodations?  Examples of accommodations include, but are not limited to:    - Tables - Chairs - Ledge / Counter-tops - Food Court Seating - Benches  Are carry out and delivery orders taxable?  If you meet both criteria, then all of your non-exempt retail sales of food are taxable whether it is carry out, delivery, or consumed on-premises.  Are there any types of exempt sales?  Sales which are exempt under the Illinois Retailers’ Occupation Tax are exempt.  For example, school cafeteria food sold to students and hospital food sold to patients are not taxable.  Are alcohol sales taxable?  Businesses that meet the two criteria must report their alcohol sales with their food sales.  This includes establishments whose primary source of revenue is from liquor sales, but meet the two criteria listed previously (i.e. bars, taverns, etc.)  For example, bars and taverns that heat and sell frozen pizzas have been determined to be subject to the tax.   Are catering sales taxable?  If your business provides catering services, there are several factors that you   must consider in order for those sales to be excluded from the tax.  If your business is taxable for the Restaurant Tax, your catering service is also taxable if the “service” is limited to delivery of the food.  Factors such as separate kitchen, separate accounting records, and additional services provided to the client must be considered before taking a deduction for catering.  (Please reference the Restaurant Tax Regulations Section 5 concerning “mixed facilities or operations”).  Are ledges and counters considered accommodations for eating?  If your business offers a ledge or counter for your customers to eat their food, you are subject to the restaurant tax.  Please note that if your business is a “Carry-Out Only” facility, but you provide a table and/or a chair for waiting customers, you will not be considered taxable unless on- premises consumption of food is allowed.  What should I do if after reading this bulletin I find I may have made errors on a previous year’s filing?  If you feel you have made errors on your Restaurant Tax return, please contact our Tax Policy Division.  We will work with you to correct your return and help make sure you do not make the same errors in the future.

General Information:  The Tax is imposed on the privilege of transferring title to, or beneficial interest in, real property located in the City of Chicago.  See section 3-33-030 of the Code.  The tax rate is $3.75 per $500.00 of the transfer price, or fraction thereof, of the real property, or beneficial interest in the property.  Id.  Governmental or Charitable Organization Exemption - Subsection 3-33-060(B) of the Code; Section 3, Paragraph B of the Form:  Transfers involving real property (1) acquired by or from a governmental body; (2) acquired by any corporation, society, association, foundation or institution organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious or educational purposes; or (3) acquired by any international organization not subject to local taxes under applicable law are exempt.  The Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddy Mac”) do not qualify as governmental bodies.  Transfers for less than $500 - Subsection 3-33-060(E) of the Municipal Code; Section 3, Paragraph E of the Form:  Transfers in which the transfer  price is less than $500 are exempt.  The “transfer price” means the consideration furnished for the transfer of title to, or beneficial interest in, real property, valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits and property, determined without any deduction for mortgages, liens or encumbrances, and specifically including the amount of any indebtedness or obligation canceled or discharged in connection with the transfer.  See subsection 3-33- 020(H).   Typical types of transfers that fall into this category are (1) transfers between a trust and its beneficiaries and (2) transfers of gifts.  With respect to transfers between trusts and their beneficiaries, only the following types of transfers are exempt from the tax:  (a) transfers from the sole beneficiaries to the trust, where the trust agreement provides that the beneficial ownership of the beneficiaries is the same as it was before the transfer into trust, and (b) transfers from the trust to the sole beneficiaries of the trust, where the distribution agreement provides that the ownership of the beneficiaries is the  same as it was before the transfer out of the trust.  With respect to transfers which result from divorce or separation proceedings, it is presumed that the consideration given for the transfer of real property between spouses is equal to the fair market value of the interest conveyed, and is subject to the Tax.  For example, if one spouse is ordered or agrees to transfer to the other spouse his or her interest in real property, which is owned jointly with the other spouse, the spouse who receives the transferring spouse’s interest is subject to taxation; and the amount of the transfer price will be presumed to be one-half of the fair market value of the real property .  See Chicago Department of Revenue Real Property Transfer Tax Ruling #3, October 3, 2005.   Transfers of property in exchange for an interest in a corporation, limited liability corporation, or other legal entity are taxable events, unless the transferor is the sole owner of the legal entity to which the property is being transferred.  The transfer price is the fair market value of the real property.  For example, if an individual or legal entity transferred its real property to a partnership and received only a one-half interest in the partnership, a Transfer Tax would be due on one-half of the fair market value of the real property.  Enterprise Zone Exemption - Subsection 3-33-060(L) of the Code; Section 3, Paragraph L of the Form:  Transfers of title to, or beneficial  October 2005  Questions?

Transfers where the property is intended to be converted into residential use and such use consumes 50% or more of the property do not qualify for the exemption.  See Chicago Department of Revenue Real Property Transfer Tax Ruling #2, May 13, 2004.    Transfers to Secured Creditors - Subsection 3-33-060(M) of the Code; Section 3, Paragraph M of the Form:  Transfers in which the deed or other instrument of transfer is issued to the mortgagee or secured creditor pursuant to a mortgage or security interest foreclosure proceeding or sale or pursuant to a transfer in lieu of foreclosure are exempt.  When a creditor holds a secured interest in property (e.g., a bank or savings and loan through a mortgage) and acquires the property either (a) at a foreclosure sale for an amount, which is equal to or less than the outstanding debt that is secured by the property, or (b) through a deed from the debtor in lieu of the foreclosure action, the transfer is exempt from the Tax.  A second mortgagee that acquires property through a foreclosure and assumes the debt of the primary secured lender is taxable on the amount of the outstanding debt owed to the primary lender.  For example, if a primary lender has an outstanding debt of $200,000 secured with real property, and a second lender has an outstanding debt of $100,000 secured with the same property; and if the second lender took a deed for the property from the debtor, in lieu of foreclosing on the property, then the second lender would incur a tax on the amount of the outstanding debt, which  it assumed (i.e., $200,000).  Other information:  Where the transfer price reported on the Form is different than the purchase price of the property, the difference must be fully explained, with full documentation attached to the Form.  The Transfer Tax is due upon the earlier of the delivery or recording of the deed, assignment or other instrument of transfer (see section 3- 33-030) and is payable through the purchase of stamps (see section 3- 33-040).  Title companies are responsible for making sure that stamps are purchased, cancelled, and affixed to the deed or other instrument of transfer, when they receive the proceeds for the stamps at the closing.  See section 3-33-040.  Failure to purchase and affix the stamps will subject them to interest and penalties that accrue on the unpaid tax.  A program is being offered by the City during the period beginning October 24, 2005, and ending December 16, 2005, to provide amnesty from interest and penalties on Transfer Tax liabilities incurred prior to July 1, 2005.  Amnesty is not available with respect to any tax identified in any written notice of tax audit or tax investigation that the Department has sent to a taxpayer or other debtor.  Persons interested in acquiring amnesty  must apply by filling out the application available at www.cityofchicago.org.  A person’s failure to properly apply for amnesty continues to subject such person to penalties and interest on unpaid Transfer Taxes, and may also subject the person to an additional amnesty penalty.

In the case of a 100% replacement there is no fee applied because the customer pays nothing for the exchange, and it is therefore not a sale at retail.  There is however, a full $1.00 fee in the case of pro-rata replacements, because the customer does pay something, making this transaction a sale at retail.  Are mail order sales subject to the fee?  No.  Is sales tax applied to the tire fee?  No, the tire fee is independent of any sales tax imposed on the sale price of the tires.  How often is the tire fee remitted and when are returns due?  The fee is to be remitted monthly with fees collected in one month payable by the last day of the subsequent month.  The fee return for periods commencing on July 1st of each year and ending on June 30 of the subsequent year, is filed annually and is due by August 15th of each year.  TO:  Retail Sellers of New Tires  The purpose of this informational bulletin is to discuss certain issues pertaining to the Chicago Tire Fee, Chicago Municipal Code Section 11-4-142.  General Information  On and after July 1, 2005, any person selling new tires at retail or offering new tires for retail sale in the City shall collect from retail customers a fee of $1.00 per new tire sold at retail and delivered in the City to be paid to the Department.  Is this tax imposed in conjunction with the sale of motor vehicles?  No, the fee is applied in instances where tires are sold separately and not in conjunction with the sale of a motor vehicle.  What tires qualify for the Tire Fee?  The fee applies to the sale of tires to be used for vehicles defined in Section 1-217 of the Illinois Vehicle Code along with aircraft tires, special mobile equipment, and implements of husbandry.  Are used or reprocessed tires subject to the fee ?  No. Neither used nor reprocessed tires are subject to the new fee.  What is a reprocessed tire?  A reprocessed tire is a tire that has been recapped, retreaded, or regrooved and that has not been placed on a wheel rim.

(References to sections of the Municipal Code of Chicago and related rulings are indicated in parenthesis.)  General Information  The Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax ordinance imposes a 6% tax on (1) the lease or rental in the city of personal property or (2) the privilege of using in the city personal property that is leased or rented outside the city.  The incidence of the tax and the obligation to pay the tax are upon the lessee of the personal property.   (3-32-030(A)).   How is the tax collected?  It is the duty of each lessor to collect the Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax from the lessee at the time of each lease or rental payment, and to remit the tax to the Department of Revenue.   In the event that a lessor fails to collect or remit the tax, the lessor shall be liable to the city for the amount of such tax.  (3-32-070(A)).   How does the Personal Property Lease Transaction   Tax apply to mail box leases?  In  general,  for  service  contracts  that involve both a sale of a service and a lease of personal property, the lessor is required to separate the lease or rental portion from the sale  portion. If such lessor  fails  to  separate  the  lease  or rental portion of the price charged from the non-lease or non-rental portion, the entire  price  charged  shall  be  deemed taxable, unless it is clearly proven that at least 50% of the price is not for the use  of  any  personal  property.  If  this occurs,  the  portion  not representing  the  use  of  personal property would be non-taxable. (Ruling #7, Section 5).    then   Because  the  lease  or  rental  of  mail boxes involves both a sale of service and  a  lease  of  personal  property,  the Department of Revenue has determined that approximately 25% of the charge is attributable to the rental portion and therefore,  subject  the  Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax.  The Department of Revenue will not assess additional  taxes  on  mail  box  lessors who timely remit the tax based on 25% of  the  consideration  charged  for  the lease or rental of mail boxes.    to   Example:  A  mail  box  Lessor  charges his  customer  $100  for  the  lease  or rental  of  a  mail  box.    The  lessor computes  the  tax  due  using  the  safe harbor rate as follows:  $100 charge * 25% safe harbor rate =  $25 taxable amount  $25 taxable amount * 6% tax rate =  $1.50 tax due     Lessors who choose not to rely on this 25% safe harbor rate must report 100% of  lease  or  rental  charges  and  then deduct  all  non-lease  charges  to compute the taxable amount.  If upon audit  the  Department  determines  that the non-lease charges were overstated, additional taxes due will be assessed, along  with  applicable  penalties  and interest.   What  are  the  payment  and filing  requirements  for  mail box lessors?  For all periods beginning after  August  31,  2003,  all  lessors  are required  to  collect  and  remit  the Personal  Property  Lease  Transaction Tax and file applicable returns pursuant to  the  Uniform  Revenue  Procedures Ordinance  (3-4)  on  all  transactions involving  the  lease  or  rental  of  mail boxes.    to  collect   Specifically, on or before the last day of  each  calendar  month,  every  lessor required  the  Personal Property Lease  Transaction Tax must remit the tax along with a remittance coupon    relating  to  the  tax  collected during the preceding calendar month. For example, the  September 2003 tax remittance is due on or before  October  31,  2003.    Each  lessor  is allowed  to  retain  1%  of  the  Personal Property  Lease  Transaction  Tax  it collects to reimburse itself for expenses incurred in connection with accounting for  and  remitting  the  tax  to  the Department of Revenue; provided that this service fee shall not be allowed for taxes  not  the Department. (3-32-070(A))  timely  remitted   to   In addition, a return must be filed with the Department on an annual basis on   Informational Bulletin  October 2003  report   returns  must   or  before  August  15  of  each  year.  Annual  tax liabilities  and  other  applicable information  for  the  12-month  period ending the immediately preceding June 30  (the  ""annual  tax  year"").  (3-4- 186(A))  With regard to the Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax due for the lease or rental of  mail boxes, the first  annual  tax  year  shall  cover September  1,  2003  through  June  30, 2004.

This is the  first Information Bulletin issued to parking operators.   General Information  The parking tax is imposed on the use and privilege of parking a motor vehicle in or upon any  parking lot or garage in the City of Chicago. The ultimate incidence of and liability for payment  of this tax is on the parking recipient. It shall be the duty of every operator of a parking lot or  garage to secure the tax from each recipient and to remit the tax to the Department of Revenue.  The municipal code reference for this tax is Chapter 4-236.   Amendments to the Parking Tax  On November 17, 1999 , the City Council passed amendments to the parking tax which are  effective March 1, 2000. The amendments include:    •  A Tax Rate Increase     Except as noted below, the parking tax rate has been increased from $1.50 to $2.00 for  each motor vehicle parked in a lot or garage for every 24-hour period or fraction thereof.  The rate of tax has been increased from $7.50 to $10.00 if the charge for parking is made  on a weekly basis and from $30.00 to $40.00 if the charge for parking is on a monthly  basis.     •  Limited Reduced Tax Rates     The parking tax has been reduced under certain circumstances. If the charge for parking a  motor vehicle for a 24-hour period or fraction thereof is greater than $2.00 but less than  $5.00, the parking tax will be 75 cents. If the charge for parking a motor vehicle on a  weekly basis is greater than $10.00 but less than $25.00, the parking tax will be $3.75. If  the charge for parking a motor vehicle on a monthly basis is greater than $50.00 but less  than $100.00, the tax will be $15.00.     •  Limited Tax -Free Parking     The tax shall not be imposed on parking privileges where the charge or fee does not  exceed $2.00 for a 24-hour period or fraction thereof, or $10.00 for a weekly period or  $40.00 for a monthly period.     In summary, where an operator charges different parking rates based on the day of week  or length of time that a motor vehicle is parked, the applicable tax rate for the parking  privilege shall be determined by the actual amount charged for that motor vehicle.    It should be noted that the full tax rate will apply to all parking privileges in cases where  an operator fails to keep accurate and complete books and records evidencing that the  reduced rate or no tax applies.     •  New Collector's Commission   •     For the period February 1, 1997 to July 31, 1997, operators may retain a total of one  percent of the parking tax they collect to reimburse themselves for expenses incurred in  connection with collecting, accounting for and remitting the tax, and with implementing  the parking tax changes set forth in the recent amendments to the parking ordinance.    This commission shall not be allowed for taxes not timely remitted to the Department of  Revenue or for periods during which an operator is not in compliance with the ticket, tag  or receipt requirements contained in Chapter 4-236 of the municipal code of Chicago.    Issuance of Receipts    An additional requirement has been added to the parking tax. Operators will now be  required to issue receipts to daily parkers showing the amount of the parking charge and  the amount of the parking tax paid.    Unless a cash register is used which produces a daily summary tape showing the number  of motor vehicles parked, the total charges paid and the amount of tax collected for each  tier of parking taxes, and unless the tapes are maintained as required, the receipt shall be  in the form of a two-part numerical receipt.     Operators required to issue two-part receipts shall retain one part and issue one part to the  recipient. Each part shall show the parking charge and the amount of tax paid.    Operators who fail to issue receipts in the form or manner provided for in the parking tax  ordinance shall be subject to fines of not less than $50.00 nor more than $200.00 for each  motor vehicle parked for which no conforming receipt is issued to the patron.     •  Additional Record-Keeping Requirements     Section 4-236-050 outlines an operator's duty to keep accurate and complete books and  records to which the Director of Revenue shall at all times have full access.     A requirement to maintain all cash register and other receipts and all cash register tapes  was added in the recent amendments.    In addition, the daily sheets required to be maintained must now be kept separate for each   •   •   the number of motor vehicles parked in or on each lot or garage, segregated on a  daily, weekly, monthly or other basis and further segregated by the amount of the  charge or fee imposed for parking.    the actual parking tax receipts collected from all transactions.     •  Additional Reporting Requirement   location. These daily sheets are to include:       Operators will now also be required to report their monthly parking receipts, net of tax  collected, and the number of non-taxable parkers on their returns    Rights to Appeal to the Director of Revenue for Alternative Record- Keeping  Requirements  The amendments related to record keeping and issuance of receipts were added to ensure a  sufficient audit trail exists should an operator be selected for audit or come under investigation. It  is possible an operator may have systems, controls and audit trails in place presently that vary  from these requirements but are acceptable to the Department of Revenue.    If an operator feels this is the case, an application may be submitted to the Director outlining  systems, controls and the audit trail of documents.   All applications should detail the nature of the operation ( ie. garage, parking lot operated at a  fixed location throughout the year, parking lot operated on an event basis, honor lot, etc.) for  which the application is made and include sufficient explanation of proposed alternatives. Copies  of related business documents and records should be attached to the application where possible.   You should also be aware of the fact that the parking tax ordinance includes a provision wherein  operators, on an annual basis, may request approval from the Director of Revenue to discard  tickets and tags that were issued more than one year earlier. The Director shall grant such  approval if he or she determines that the operator's books and records satisfy the record-keeping  requirements of the parking tax ordinance.

Both of these amendments are  dependant on the maximum capacity of the venues in which the amusements will be conducted  and the nature of the related performances.   Tax Reduction on Certain Amusements:  Pursuant to revisions to section-4-156-020 E., the rate of tax on admission fees or other charges,  to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other live cultural performances that take  place in any auditorium, theater or other space in the city, whose maximum capacity, including  all balconies and other sections, is more than 750 persons and less than 5000 persons, has been  reduced to 3%.   Elimination of Tax on Certain Amusements and Maximum Capacity:  Pursuant to revisions to section 4-156-020 D., the amusement tax shall not apply to or be  imposed upon the admission fees to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other live  cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in the city whose  maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is not more than 750 persons.   If all of the amusements conducted in your venue meet the requirements of this section and  your venue AT ALL TIMES has a capacity of not more than 750 persons, you should  complete and return the enclosed affidavit according to the instructions included thereon.  Upon verification and approval, we will deactivate your amusement tax account.   Clarification of Effective Date:  Both of the rate amendments shall take effect on January 1, 1999.

22845`https://www.cityofchicago.org/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxSupportingInformation/August_1998_Bulletin_Electricity_Use_Tax.pdf`Success`Success`7`7`Not a fillable PDF.`August 1998 Information Bulletin    Information Bulletin  Electricity Use Tax & Infrastructure Maintenance Fee     To: Distributors and Resellers of Electricity  The purpose of this Informational Bulletin is to provide information regarding filing the Chicago  Electricity Use Tax & Chicago Electricity Infrastructure Maintenance Fee and to clarify  requirements associated with the imposition of this tax and fee.   General Information  As a result of changes to the Illinois Municipal Code, municipalities may now impose (1) a tax  on the privilege of using or consuming electricity acquired in a purchase at retail and (2) an  infrastructure maintenance fee as compensation for the privilege of using public rights of way.  These revenue measures replace the city's Electricity Occupation Tax and Electricity Franchise  Fee, and are revenue neutral.   CHICAGO ELECTRICITY USE TAX  The Chicago Electricity Use Tax is imposed upon the privilege of using or consuming electricity  acquired in a purchase at retail and used or consumed within the corporate limits of the city.   What is the tax rate?   The tax rates, calculated on a monthly basis, are as follows:    i.   for the first 2,000 kilowatt-hours used or consumed in a month; 0.61 cents per kilowatt- hour;    ii.  for the next 48,000 kilowatt-hours used or consumed in a month; 0.40 cents per kilowatt-  iii.  for the next 50,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.36 cents per kilowatt-  iv.  for the next 400,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.35 cents per   v.  for the next 500,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.34 cents per   hour;    hour;    kilowatt-hour;    kilowatt-hour;    kilowatt-hour;    kilowatt-hour;    per kilowatt-hour;    kilowatt-hour; and    vi.  for the next 2,000,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.32 cents per   vii. for the next 2,000,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.315 cents per   viii.   for the next 5,000,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.31 cents   ix.  for the next 10,000,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.305 cents per   x.  for all electricity used or consumed in excess of 20,000,000 kilowatt-hours in a month;   0.30 cents per kilowatt-hour.    EXAMPLE 1:  In November 1998, XYZ Company sold to their residential customers the total of 20,000  kilowatt-hours of electricity. Kilowatt-hours distributed to individual customers are as follows:   Customer 1:  1,500  Customer 2:  8,000  Customer 3: 10,500  TOTAL:      20,000  What is the Chicago Electricity Use Tax to be remitted to the Revenue Department for that  month?   Customer 1: 1500 kilowatt-hours @ $0.00610 = $ 9.15   Customer 2: 2000 kilowatt-hours @ $0.00610 + 6000 kilowatt-hours @ $0.004 = $12.20 +  $24.00 = $36.20   Customer 3: 2000 kilowatt-hours @ $0.00610 + 8500 kilowatt-hours @ $0.004 = $12.20 +  $34.00 = $46.20   Total Tax Due: $9.15 + $36.20 + $46.20 = $91.55   The kilowatt hours distributed in November 1998 should be reported on the Electricity Use Tax  return in the following categories:   Categories for individual customer  (0 - 2,000)  (2,000.01 - 50,000)    Note:    Tax Rate  Tax Due  $0.0061  $0.0040     Kilowatt-hours  5,500  14,500      33.55  58.00  $91.55   1.  The appropriate tax rate should be applied to the sum of kilowatt-hours sold to individual   customers falling within applicable ranges.    2.  When total kilowatt-hours of electricity sold to one customer in a month exceed 2000, the   tax rate of $0.0061 per kilowatt-hour has to be applied to the first 2000 kilowatt- hours,  then the rate applicable to the next range (2,000.1 - 50,000) should be used for the  remaining 48,000 kilowatt-hours sold, then you move to the next range (see the above  example).    What are the allowable deductions from the Chicago Electricity Use Tax?  Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an active resale number and complying  with all other conditions of section 3-53-50 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, shall be excused  from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the electricity delivered to the reseller,  provided that the person reports to the department the total amount of electricity delivered to the  reseller, and such other information that the director may reasonably require.   In order to qualify as a reseller, you must send the enclosed copy of the resale certificate to the  Revenue Department by August 21, 1998. Our department will contact your provider and inform  them about your reseller status. If we do not have your resale certificate on file by that day, we  will notify your provider that you are not a reseller. Resale certificates obtained at a later date  will not be retroactive. For the period with no resale certificate on file you will not be able to  apply for credit relating to the tax paid to the provider.   Starting with the first bill issued on or after September 1, 1998, resellers having an active resale  number will not be charged tax by their provider. Therefore, we will stop issuing letters of credit  to resellers for the tax they paid to their providers. All letters of credit issued prior to that have to  be used within one year from the date they were issued.    To request a resale number send a completed resale certificate to:    City of Chicago  Department of Revenue  Exemption Unit  333 S. State Street, Suite 300  Chicago, Illinois 60604-3977  Attn: Miriam Velazquez    The Exemption unit will assign a resale number to a reseller only after the reseller files a  complete application with the Revenue Department. Every provider selling electricity to a  reseller must retain a copy of the reseller's resale certificate. Failure to meet this requirement will  result in disallowance of this deduction to the provider.   Any provider who takes a deduction for electricity delivered to a reseller, must fill out and file  with each Electricity Use Tax return the worksheet included with this Informational Bulletin. For  each reseller to whom you sold electricity, you must list a name, address, drev number, resale  number, and the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity sold. If this information is not provided,  your deductions will be disallowed. The department will reconcile the information furnished by  electricity providers, on the number of kilowatt-hours resold, to the data reported by electricity  resellers on their Electricity Use Tax returns. If discrepancies are found, deficiency notices will  be issued.   If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or consumption and partly for resale, the  reseller shall pay the tax directly to the department on the amount of electricity that the reseller  uses or consumes, and shall collect and remit the tax on the amount of electricity delivered by the  reseller to a purchaser.   Also, the person delivering electricity shall be allowed credit for the tax related to deliveries of  electricity the charges for which are written off as uncollectible, however, if such charges are  thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit such tax.   Is the U.S. Government, Foreign Diplomats and the City of Chicago exempt from paying  the Electricity Use Tax?  Yes. Electricity distributed to the U.S. Government, Foreign Embassies, and the City of Chicago  is exempt from the Electricity Use Tax.   How is the tax collected?  The Chicago Electricity Use Tax shall be collected from purchasers by the person maintaining a  place of business in the State of Illinois who delivers electricity to such purchasers.   Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding such tax to the  gross charge for delivering the electricity. They shall also be authorized to add to such gross  charge an amount equal to 3% of the tax they collect to reimburse them for their expenses  incurred in keeping records, billing customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and  supplying data to the city upon request.   What are the filing requirements?  Every tax collector shall on a monthly basis file with the department a return on a form included  with this Informational Bulletin.   The return and accompanying remittance shall be due on or before the last day of the month  following the month during which the tax is collected or is required to be collected under Section  3-53-030.    The tax shall be imposed with respect to the use or consumption of electricity by residential  customers beginning with the first bill issued on or after September 1, 1998; and with respect to  the use or consumption of electricity by nonresidential customers beginning with the first bill  issued to such customer for delivery services in accordance with Section 16-104 of the Public  Utilities Act, or the first bill issued to such customers on or after January 1, 2001, whichever  issuance occurs sooner.   When a reseller distributes electricity to residential and non-residential tenants who occupy the  same building, non-residential tenants, for filing purposes, should be treated as residential and  total kilowatt-hours of electricity distributed to them should be reported on the Chicago  Electricity Use Tax return.   If only non-residential tenants occupy a building, electricity distributed to them will continue to  be subject to the occupation tax imposed on distribution of electricity by chapter 3-40 of the  Municipal Code of Chicago until they become subject to the Chicago Electricity Use Tax, as  provided by Section 3-53-020(D) of the Municipal Code of Chicago.   What records must be kept?  Every tax collector, and every taxpayer required to pay the Chicago Electricity Use Tax shall  keep accurate books and records of its business or activity. The books and records shall be  subject to and available for inspection by the department at all times during business hours of the  day.   Credits and refunds.  No person shall be entitled to a refund of, or credit for, the tax, unless the person files a claim for  refund or credit within one year after the date on which the tax was paid or remitted to the  department.   Application of uniform revenue procedures ordinance.  The Uniform Revenue Procedures Ordinance, Chapter 3-4 of the Municipal Code of Chicago,  generally applies to the administration and enforcement of this chapter.   Will the occupation tax imposed on distribution of electricity by chapter 3-40 of Municipal  Code of Chicago remain in effect?  Yes. The Electricity Occupation Tax will continue to apply to nonresidential customers until they  become subject to the Electricity Use Tax.   CHICAGO ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE FEE  The Chicago Electricity Infrastructure Maintenance Fee is imposed upon electricity deliverers, as  compensation for the privilege of using public rights of way.   This fee is imposed in addition to all taxes, fees and other revenue measures imposed by the city,  the State of Illinois or any other political subdivision of the State, provided, however, that no fee  or other compensation shall be required from electricity deliverers for use of the public way,  except as provided in subsections 3-54-090(B)&(C) of the Municipal Code of Chicago.   How much is the fee?   The fee is imposed at the following rates:    i.   for the first 2,000 kilowatt-hours used or consumed in a month; 0.53 cents per kilowatt- hour;    ii.  for the next 48,000 kilowatt-hours used or consumed in a month; 0.35 cents per kilowatt-  iii.  for the next 50,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.31 cents per kilowatt-  iv.  for the next 400,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.305 cents per   v.  for the next 500,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.30 cents per   vi.  for the next 2,000,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.28 cents per   hour;    hour;    kilowatt-hour;    kilowatt-hour;    kilowatt-hour;    kilowatt-hour;    per kilowatt-hour;    kilowatt-hour; and    vii. for the next 2,000,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.275 cents per   viii.   for the next 5,000,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.27 cents   ix.  for the next 10,000,000 kilowatt- hours used or consumed in a month; 0.265 cents per   x.  for all kilowatt-hours of electricity in excess of 20,000,000 kilowatt- hours used or   consumed in a month; 0.26 cents per kilowatt-hour.    What are the allowable deductions from the Chicago Electricity Infrastructure  Maintenance Fee ?  Sales for resale are exempt from the fee. However, it should be noted that no exemption from  the fee shall apply to the delivery of electricity to a person who owns, controls or manages, or  acts as agent for, a building, buildings, or group of customers within the city, where such person  distributes the electricity to the occupants of the building or buildings, or to the group of  customers. In those cases the provider is to collect the fee from the reseller and remit it to the  department.   The person delivering electricity shall be allowed credit for any portion of the fee related to  deliveries of electricity the charges for which are written off as uncollectible, however, if such  charges are thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to pay such fee.   Is the U.S. Government, Foreign Diplomats and the City of Chicago exempt from paying  the Electricity Infrastructure Maintenance Fee?  Yes. Electricity distributed to the U.S. Government, Foreign Embassies, and the City of Chicago  is exempt from the Electricity Infrastructure Maintenance Fee.   How is the fee collected?  Any electricity deliverer making or effectuating a delivery of electricity shall pay the fee to the  Department.   The amount of fee imposed under this chapter may be collected from the purchaser using or  consuming the electricity with respect to which the fee was imposed. The fee may be collected  by the electricity deliverer from the purchaser as a separately stated charge on the purchaser's  bills.   What are the filing requirements?  Every electricity deliverer required to pay the fee shall on a monthly basis file with the  department a return on a form included with this Informational Bulletin.    The return and remittance shall be filed on or before the last day of each calendar month for  electricity delivered to purchasers during the preceding calendar month.   The fee with respect to the kilowatt- hours delivered to residential customers shall become  effective beginning with the first bill issued on or after September 1, 1998. The fee with respect  to the kilowatt-hours delivered to non-residential customers shall become effective beginning  with the first bill issued on or after November 1, 1999.   What records must be kept?  Every electricity deliverer required to pay the fee shall keep accurate books and records of its  business or activity. The books and records shall be subject to and available for inspection by the  department at all times during business hours of the day.   Application of uniform revenue procedures ordinance.

22846`https://www.cityofchicago.org/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxSupportingInformation/June_1998_Info_Bulletin_Government_Exemptions.pdf`Success`Success`5`5`Not a fillable PDF.`"June 1998 Information Bulletin    Information Bulletin  Governmental Exemptions from Chicago Taxes and Fees   To: GOVERNMENTAL BODIES/AGENCIES  The purpose of this informational bulletin is to clarify which taxes and fees under the Chicago  Municipal Code allow for a governmental exemption.   Furthermore, the bulletin provides guidance to government organizations so that they may  determine if they qualify for any of the exemptions.   Upon completion of the application process, the City of Chicago will issue exemption certificates  to qualified organizations. The exemption certificates' purpose is to protect all parties to whom it  is presented. The certificate provides the tax collector with documented evidence of a qualified  exemption.   After reading this information bulletin, if you believe that your organization qualifies for any of  the municipal tax and/or fee exemptions, you should submit a completed Application For A  Governmental Body Exemption along with supporting documentation.   For which taxes and fees do government exemptions apply?  The municipal taxes that contain an exemption for governmental bodies/agencies are as follows:    •  Emergency Telephone System Surcharge/Fee    •  Network Connections Surcharge (Land based lines).   The 911 surcharge does not apply to the network connections provided to the  Federal government and to the City of Chicago.    •  Wireless Surcharge   Pursuant to Section 7-50-020(E) of the Chicago Municipal Code, the 911 fee shall  not apply to any wireless telephone number assigned to a governmental body.   The 911 fee is not exempted for government employees who contract for wireless  communication services for their personal use. The exemption shall apply only  when the service is billed directly to and paid by a governmental body.    Example: A government employee, is seeking to purchase wireless communication  services for his personal cellular phone. He contracts with a cellular provider who offered  a discounted government package through an advertisement to his office. He may  contract for the cellular service through the discounted offer, but he is not entitled to the  911 fee exemption because he is obtaining the service for his personal phone.    •  Gas Use Tax   Pursuant to Section 3-41-030(D) of the Chicago Municipal Code, use or consumption of  gas by a governmental body is exempt from taxation.    •  Hotel Accommodations Tax   A government exemption is allowed only in those instances where the federal  government has directly reserved the hotel accommodations for government functions or  employees. When only the economic incidence and not the direct burden of the Chicago  Hotel Accommodations Tax falls upon the federal government (i.e., where employee is  reimbursed for his expense), such will not create a situation eligible for exemption.    One exception to this rule exists. Article 34 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic  Relations (signed by the United States in 1972) exempts diplomatic agents from direct  taxation by municipal bodies. Inasmuch as the Chicago Hotel Accommodations is a  direct tax on a renter or lessee, diplomatic agents are exempt from this tax.    •  Occupation Taxes   A.  Distribution of Natural Gas Pursuant to Section 3-40-030 of the Chicago   Municipal Code, natural gas sold to the City of Chicago is exempt from taxation.  The ordinance defines ""gross receipts"" as the consideration received for  distributing, supplying, furnishing, or selling gas for use or consumption and not  for resale and for all services rendered in connection therewith valued in money,  whether received in money, or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and  property of every kind and nature, except for that consideration provided by the  city of Chicago, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the  cost of the product or commodity supplied, the cost of material used, labor or  service cost, or any other expenses whatsoever.    B.  Distribution of Electricity Pursuant to Section 3-40-160 of the Chicago Municipal   Code, electricity sold to the City of Chicago is exempt from taxation. The  ordinance defines ""gross receipts"" as the consideration received for distributing,  supplying, furnishing, or selling electricity for use or consumption and not for  resale and for all services rendered in connection therewith valued in money,  whether received in money, or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and  property of every kind and nature, except for that consideration provided by the  city of Chicago, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the  cost of the product or commodity supplied, the cost of material used, labor or  service cost, or any other expenses whatsoever.    •  Parking Lot and Garage Operations Tax   An exemption is allowed when the federal government contracts, is billed directly by,  and pays for, the use of a parking lot or garage.   This exemption would not, however, relieve federal government employees from the  parking tax when payment is made by the employees and reimbursed by the federal  government agency. In addition, government employees who are driving government  vehicles on personal time cannot claim the exemption when parking at a facility that the  government has contracted with for business use.   There is one exception to this rule. Article 34 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic  Relations (signed by the United States in 1972) exempts diplomatic agents from direct  taxation by municipal bodies. Inasmuch as the Parking Lot/Garage Operations Tax is a  direct tax on the contractor for parking arrangements, diplomatic agents are exempt from  this tax.    •  Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax   Pursuant to section 3-32-040 of the Chicago Municipal Code, a lessee that is a  government body is exempt from this tax. There is no exemption for government  employees who rent/lease tangible personal property for their personal use.   In addition, the exemption would not apply to a contractor who leases tangible personal  property in connection with providing services for a government body. The contractor  would be considered the lessee and the exemption status of the government body would  have no bearing on the transaction.    •  Telecommunications Tax   Pursuant to Section 3-70-20(M)(1) of the Chicago Municipal Code, charges billed to the  City of Chicago, federal government, state government and state universities created by  statute are exempt from taxation.   The exemption for state governments and state universities created by statute extends  only to telecommunications purchased for their own use. They are not exempt from the  obligation to collect and remit tax on sales of telecommunications to others when they act  as retailers of telecommunications.    •  Use Tax for Nontitled Personal Property   Pursuant to Section 3-27-050(A), items of tangible personal property which are exempted  under the provisions of the Illinois Use Tax Act, as amended, are exempt for the Chicago  Use Tax for Nontitled Personal Property.   Pursuant to the Illinois Use Tax Act, 35 ILCS 105/3-5(4), purchases of nontitled personal  property by government bodies are exempt.   The exemption also applies to contractors who purchase materials incorporated into real  estate owned by a governmental entity.   There is no exemption for purchases of nontitled personal property by government  employees for personal use.    •  Use Tax for Titled Personal Property   Pursuant to Section 3-28-031 of the Chicago Municipal Code, uses of titled personal  property that are exempt under the applicable provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code,  as amended, and the Illinois Use Tax Act, as amended, are exempt from the tax.   Pursuant to the Illinois Use Tax Act, 35 ILCS 105/3-5(4), purchases of titled personal  property by government bodies are exempt.   There is no exemption for government employees who purchase titled personal property  from a retailer for personal use.    •  Vehicle Fuel Tax   Pursuant to Section 3-52-110(F) of the Chicago Municipal Tax Code, sales to or uses of  vehicle fuel by the federal government or any state or local government are exempt from  this tax.   •  Others:   Listed below are other Chicago municipal taxes that contain governmental body  exemptions. The sections pertaining to allowable exemptions are referenced next to each  tax. Exemption certificates will not be issued for these taxes due to the fact that they are  directly remitted to the City by the taxpayer.   •  Boat Mooring Tax-Section 3-16-040  •  Employers' Expense Tax-Section 3- 20-020(G)  •  Ground Transportation Tax-Section 3-46-060(D)  •  Motor Vehicle Lessor Tax-Section 3- 48-030(D)  •  MPEA-Section 1-3  •  Real Property Transfer Tax-Section 3-33-060    Which of the taxes under the Chicago Municipal Code do not contain an  exemption for governmental bodies/agencies?   Amusement Tax  Automatic Amusement Device   Cigarette Tax  Foreign Fire Insurance Tax  Fountain Soft Drink Tax  Liquor Tax  Soft Drink Tax  What should I do with the exemption certificate we currently have on file?  It is the Department's intent to replace all previously issued exemption certificates and to issue  new certificates to all government agencies so that they may be provided to all respective  vendors as proof of exempt status. Previously issued certificates should be returned to the  Chicago Department of Revenue where they will be canceled.   Why should our government agency apply for an exemption certificate with  the City of Chicago?  All government bodies that qualify for an exemption from Chicago Municipal Taxes should  request an exemption certificate. The purpose of the certificate is to protect all parties to whom it  is presented, including vendors.   How do I apply for an exemption?  One may apply for either an individual or a group exemption. You must send a completed  Application For A Governmental Body Exemption with supporting documentation to the  Refund/Exemptions Unit of the Chicago Department of Revenue at the address listed below.  Upon approval, a prenumbered exemption certificate will be issued.   What type of support documents can be submitted along with my exemption  application?   1.  The following documents may be submitted, along with your application, in order to   make a proper determination:    a.  Articles of Incorporation   b.  Organizational Constitution   c.  Federal Exemption Letter   d.  State Exemption Letter   e.  Brochures or other printed materials explaining the purposes, functions and   activities of the organization.    2.  For organizations filing a group exemption it is requested that they submit a listing of all   subordinate organizations under their control. The listing should identify each  subordinate by name and address and should include the subordinate's Federal  Employment Identification Numbers (FEIN) and Illinois Business Tax Numbers (IBTN).    What should I do if there is a change in a group exemption?  Depending on the changes in a group exemption the following remedies are to be followed:    •  Change in the central organization.   If the central organization changes its name and/or address but has no structural changes,  it should complete and submit an exemption certificate amendment form (Part A) with  documentation to support the changes.   •  Change in the structure of subordinates.   If the number of subordinates increases or decreases or their name and/or address   changes, the centralized organization should complete and submit an exemption  certificate amendment form (Part B) with documentation to support the changes.   Once the amendment form and supporting documents are reviewed, the City will issue an  updated exemption certificate.   If the organization terminates, must I return my certificate to the City?  Yes. If the organization terminates, then the certificate must be returned to the City.   Note: The Department reserves the right to audit any government agency/body to determine if an  exemption certificate has been used for official purposes only. Fraudulent misuse of an  exemption certificate may result in an assessment of penalties and interest in addition to any tax  due.   Questions?

22847`https://www.cityofchicago.org/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxSupportingInformation/May1997InformationBulletinProperty.pdf`Success`Success`2`2`Not a fillable PDF.`"May 1997 Information Bulletin    Information Bulletin  Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax/Down Payments  and Trade-In Allowances   To: Registered Lessors  In April 1996 the Chicago Department of Revenue issued the Informational Bulletin, Volume 1  Number 1 addressing Common Lease Transaction Tax Issues for Vehicle Leasing Companies.  There was some confusion about the taxability of down payments and trade-in allowances. The  purpose of this informational bulletin is to further clarify the application of the Chicago Personal  Property Lease Transaction Tax to down payments and trade-in allowances on long term vehicle  leases.   General Information  The Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax ordinance imposes a 6% tax on (1) the  lease or rental in the city of personal property or (2) the privilege of using in the city personal  property that is leased or rented outside the city (3-32-030(A)).   Down payments and trade-in allowances are considered part of the ""lease price"" or ""rental price"";  therefore, under certain circumstances they are subject to the Chicago Personal Property Lease  Transaction Tax. The portion of a down payment or trade-in allowance which is taxable depends  on the number of months taxable under the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax.  The taxability of the monthly lease payment depends on where the lease transaction occurs and  where the vehicle is used.   Are down payments and trade-in allowances taxable if the vehicle is leased in  the city?  Yes, down payments and trade-in allowances are taxable for leases which are entered into in the  city. The portion of the down payment or trade-in allowance which is taxable depends on the  location of the use of the vehicle. If the vehicle is:    •  Used In the City   The tax would apply only to a fraction of the down payment and trade-in allowance. A  lease payment is not considered taxable for any rental period in which the vehicle is used  solely outside the city. However, the tax is due for the lease payment and for the portion  of the down payment and trade-in value for the period in which the lessee takes  possession or delivery of the vehicle at a location within the city.   Example: A customer leases a vehicle from a leasing company located in Chicago. The  lease has a 36-month lease term. The customer garages the vehicle in Oak Brook. The  customer made a down payment of $1,000 and had a trade-in with the value of $1,000.   The tax would apply to the entire amount of the down payment and trade-in allowance. In  the case of personal property such as a motor vehicle, the garaging, storing or keeping of  the property constitutes a use. To determine the location of a vehicle's use, lessors should  consult insurance documents which show where the vehicle is domiciled or garaged.  (Transaction Tax Ruling #12)    •  Used Outside the City   The first month of the lease would be considered taxable because the lessee took  possession of the vehicle at a location within the city; therefore, 1/36 (1 taxable monthly  lease payment out of a 36- month lease) of the down payment and 1/36 of the trade-in  value would be considered taxable. The taxable down payment and trade-in amount  would be $2,000 ($1,000 down payment + $1,000 trade-in value) * 1/36 = $55.55. The  tax due on the down payment and the trade-in would be $55.55 * 6% = $3.33.    Are down payments and trade-in allowances taxable if the vehicle is leased  outside the city?  The taxability of down payments or trade-in allowances for leases which are entered into outside  the city depends on the location of the use of the vehicle. If the vehicle is:    •  Used In the City   •  Used Outside the City   The tax would apply to the entire amount of the down payment and trade-in allowance.    The tax would not apply to the down payment or trade-in allowance when a lessee enters  into a lease agreement outside the city and will garage the vehicle outside the city  throughout the entire lease period. However, the lessor should start collecting the tax and  should collect the taxable portion of the down payment and trade-in value when the  individual starts garaging the vehicle in the city during the lease period.    Are the down payments and trade-in allowances taxable if a lessee moves into  or out of the city during the period of the lease agreement?  Yes, the tax applies to the fraction of the down payment and trade-in allowance which the  property is used in the city.   Example: A customer leases a vehicle from a leasing company located in Oak Brook. The lease  has a 36-month lease term. The customer garages the vehicle in Oak Brook for 10 months then  garages the vehicle in Chicago for the remainder of the lease. The customer made a down  payment of $1,000 and traded in a vehicle having a value of $1,000. At the time the vehicle is  used in the city the lease becomes taxable and 26/36 (26 taxable monthly lease payments out of a  36-month lease) of the down payment and 26/36 of the trade in value would be subject to the tax.   The taxable down payment and trade- in amount would be $2,000 * 26/36 = $1,444.45 and the  tax due on the down payment and trade-in would be $1,444.45 * 6% = $86.66.   Questions?

Pursuant to section 3-32-030(A) of the Chicago Municipal Code     (“Code”), the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax (the “lease tax” or “tax”)  is imposed upon (1) the lease or rental in the City of personal property, or (2) the  privilege of using in the City personal property that is leased or rented outside the City.   Leased time on a computer is subject to the tax.  Section 3-32-020(H).  This includes the  time-sharing of a computer with other users.   For time-sharing purposes (where the  possession of the computer is not transferred), the user of the computer shall be deemed  using the computer at the location of the user's access terminal to the computer.   Therefore, if the user's terminal is within the City of Chicago, the lease tax will apply to  all charges for the use of the computer and its software, which is accessed by the user at  such terminal.  However, charges for the storage of information on the computer by the  user, which will be used at a later date by the user, and not in the immediate processing of  information, shall be deemed a usage of the computer at the computer location and not at  the access terminal; because this is not an actual use of the computer by means of an  access terminal but instead is a charge for storage at the computer location.  If at a later  date, a charge is made for accessing the stored information from a terminal located in  Chicago, such access charge would be taxable.     PRINTING   Section 2.   Charges for printing services or other services, provided that such     charges are not for the use of any personal property and are separately stated and  optional, are not  subject to the lease tax.  See Chicago Personal Property Lease  Transaction Tax Ruling #2004-3, which explains in general that a separately stated and  optional charge for services is excluded from tax.     COMPUTERS   Section 3.   Where the actual possession, but not title or ownership, of a     computer is transferred to a user for use in the City of Chicago, for consideration, such a  transaction is a lease subject to the  lease tax.  The tax will be due for all lease or rental  charges associated with the usage of the computer and its software in the City of Chicago.    Separately stated optional charges not for the use of the computer, its software or other  personal property used in the City shall not be subject to the lease tax.  An example  would be separately stated maintenance charges, if the charges are optional.     COMPUTER SOFTWARE      Section 4.      The lease or rental of computer software in the City of Chicago is  subject to the lease tax.  The sale of computer software is not subject to the lease tax.  To  determine whether a lease or rental of software occurs, the test is whether the use or  possession of such software is transferred for a consideration.  This would include all  agreements for the use or possession of such software including license agreements.  If  copyright licenses, waivers or releases are given along with the use of such software, this  will not affect the taxability of the transfer because such copyright licenses, waivers or  releases are a necessary part of the software being leased or rented.  Software under  copyright cannot be used without such licenses, waivers or releases.  Therefore, the fact  that a copyright license, waiver or release is given in a transaction will not affect its  taxability.  However, if title or ownership of the software passes in an agreement then a  sale occurs and no  lease tax would be due.  (Note: (1) If optional charges for update  services or other services are involved in the rental, and if these charges are not charges  for the use of any personal property, these charges may be separately stated and excluded  from the tax; (2) For time-sharing of software when no possession is transferred see  Sections 1 and 2 above.)    Examples of the application of Section 4:      an agreement called a copyright license agreement which transfers the possession and use  of certain software to the user, and allows such user to use such software on a month to  month basis for a payment of a specific monthly fee.  No other fees are charged the user.   At the end of the contract term or upon cancellation by the parties, the software is either  returned to the owner (or licensor) or erased.  Only incidental training and a question  answering service is provided and is a part of the monthly fee.  In this case, the total  monthly fee is taxable as a lease charge for the use of the software.      t that the agreement provides for an  indefinite use of the software for a flat fee of $2,000.00.  The user does not have to return  the software but can use the software for as long as he or she desires.  In this case, an  ownership interest in the software is transferred, so no tax is due.      monthly reports and the use of the owner's (or licensor's) personnel for training and  possible modification of the software are provided.  In such cases, if charges for such  services are separately stated and optional and are not charges for the use of any  additional personal property, such service charges are not taxable.     Same facts as (a.) above, except that update services such as   r licensor) and a Chicago user sign    (b)   Same facts as (a.) above, excep   (a)   A computer software owner (o   (c)    (d)   that in addition to the software   Same facts as (a) above, except     being leased, the owner (or licensor) agrees to customize the software for a specific fee.   The fee is a separately stated flat fee for the service of customizing the software, and the  fee is paid either in lump sum payment or in installments.  Accordingly, the monthly fee  for the use of the software is not increased for the customizing charge.  In such a case, the  monthly fee for the use of the software is taxable, but the charge for the customizing is  not.  If the customizing charge were incorporated into the monthly fee or otherwise  treated as part of the property being leased, in that the charge varies with the period of  use of the property, then the entire customizing charge would be taxable.

Simplified Telecommunications Tax #1A  Subject:  Completion of Reduced Rate Pursuant to Class Action Settlement  Effective date:  June 1, 2009    Section 1.  Chicago Municipal Code (“Code”) Section 3-73-030 imposes a tax upon  the act or privilege of originating in the city or receiving in the city intrastate or interstate  telecommunications  at  a  rate  of  seven  percent  of  the  gross  charge  for  such  telecommunications purchased at retail.    Section 2.  Effective February 1, 2005, pursuant to a court approved settlement in the  class action entitled PrimeCo v. ICC, Case No. 98 CH 05500 in the Circuit Court of Cook  County, the customers of all wireless telecommunications retailers, and the customers of  all  other  telecommunications  retailers  (such  as  resellers)  that  do  not  own  substantial  equipment  in  the  public  way  (such  wireless  and  other  telecommunications  retailers  hereafter referred to collectively as “wireless retailers”) were entitled to pay a reduced  telecommunications tax rate of 6.5%, rather than the full rate of 7% that would otherwise  apply pursuant to Code Section 3-73-030.  Pursuant to the settlement, the reduced tax rate  was to remain in effect for wireless retailers until $30 million in savings were realized, at  which  time  the  Department  would  provide  at  least  60  days'  written  notice  to  wireless  retailers that they must again collect and remit the full rate of the telecommunications tax.    Section 3.  This Ruling #1A will provide notice that the agreed $30 million in savings  have been realized, and all wireless retailers must again collect and remit the full rate of  the telecommunications tax (seven percent) as of June 1, 2009.  Ruling #1 is superseded  by this Ruling #1A and is therefore no longer in effect.

Chicago Municipal Code (ACode@) Section 3-73-030(A) provides:  ""A  tax is ... imposed upon:  (1) The act or privilege of originating in the city or receiving  in the city intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of seven percent of  the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail; and (2) The act  or  privilege  of  originating  in  the  city  or  receiving  in  the  city  interstate  telecommunications by a person at a rate of seven percent of the gross charge for  such telecommunications purchased at retail.""    Section 2.  Code  Section  3-73-020(F)  provides:    A'Gross  charge'  means  the  amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in  such  municipality  and  for  all  services  and  equipment  provided  in  connection  therewith  by  a  retailer,  valued  in  money  whether  paid  in  money  or  otherwise,  including cash, credits, services and property of every kind or nature, and shall be  determined  without  any  deduction  on  account  of  the  cost  of  such  telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or service costs or any  other expense whatsoever.""      Section 3.  Both sections quoted above refer not only to the ""act"" but also to the  ""privilege"" of originating or receiving telecommunications.  When a customer enters  into a telecommunications service contract, he or she agrees to pay certain charges,  and  in  return  he  or  she  receives  the  privilege  of  originating  or  receiving  telecommunications through the contracting telecommunications retailer.  Where  one term of the contract is the obligation to pay a charge in the event of early  termination, that early termination charge is a part of the taxable gross charges,   because it is a part of what the customer agrees to pay in return for the privilege of  originating or receiving telecommunications.     Section 4.   This ruling is intended to clarify rather than change existing law.   "

Uniform Revenue Procedures Ruling #1  Subject: Late Penalties  Effective date:  June 1, 2004    Original effective date:  September 9, 1996    Section 1.  Section 3-4-200 of the Uniform Revenue Procedures Ordinance, chapter  3-4 of the Chicago Municipal Code, generally imposes a late filing penalty if a tax return  or  remittance  return  required  by  a  tax  ordinance  is  not  filed  with  the  Department  of  Revenue  (“Department”) within the time or in the manner provided by the tax ordinance.  This penalty applies to returns that are incomplete even if they are filed on or before the  date provided by the applicable ordinance. A return shall be considered complete only if  it satisfies all of the following requirements:    The return must be filed on an original, unaltered form furnished by the    Department or on a copy of an original, unaltered form; or the return must be filed by the  taxpayer electronically via the Internet through the City of Chicago website.      Each  applicable  item  on  the  front  and  back  of  the  return  must  be  completed  according  to  the  instructions  provided  on  the  return;  and taxpayers  that  file  electronically  via  the  Internet  through  the  City  of  Chicago  website  must  fill  in  all  applicable items on the electronic return.      The return must be signed and dated by the taxpayer or by the person duly  authorized to sign on the taxpayer’s behalf.  If the return is filed electronically via the  City of Chicago website, the proper pin number that was assigned to the taxpayer must be  used, and the taxpayer must receive a confirming message from the website stating that  the return has been accepted as complete, in order for the return to be considered signed  and filed.    Section 2.  If a tax collector or taxpayer files an incomplete return and then files an  amended return with the Department on or before the due date provided by the applicable  tax  ordinance,  and  the  amended  return  is  complete,  then  the  amended  return  will  be  accepted as timely filed and no late filing penalty shall apply. However, if the amended  return is filed after the due date, the late filing penalty shall be imposed.    Section 3.  If  a  payment  accompanies  an  incomplete  return,  the  payment  will  be  accepted for deposit by the Department; however, the return will not be considered to be  timely filed and will be returned to the tax collector or taxpayer for completion.    Section 4.  Pursuant  to  Section  3-4-090  of  the  Uniform  Revenue  Procedures  Ordinance, for all periods before January 1, 2000, any payment or remittance received by   c.   the Department for a tax period will first be applied to penalties due for the period, then  to interest due for the period, and then to the tax due for the period; for all periods on and  after January 1, 2000, any payment or remittance received by the Department for a tax  period will be applied first to the interest due for the period, then to the tax due for the  period and then to the penalties for the period.      Section 5.  Pursuant to subsection 3-4-120(E) of the Uniform Revenue Procedures  Ordinance, unless the applicable tax ordinance provides otherwise, if a tax collector or  taxpayer files an amended return, any applicable statute of limitations period shall  commence at the end of the calendar year in which the amended return was filed.

In  accordance  with  Code  Section  3-4-030,  any  rule  or  regulation  promulgated by the Department shall be published in one or more newspapers of general  circulation  in  the  City  no  fewer  than  10  days  and  no  more  than  30  days  prior  to  its  effective date.

Amendments  to  rules  or  regulations  shall  be  made  following  the   Section 4.    Section 3.   ISSUANCE OF PRIVATE  LETTER   RULINGS  BY THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE      Section 5.   The Department, through the Corporation Counsel of the City of  Chicago (the “Corporation Counsel’s Office”) will issue private letter rulings concerning  the applicability of a particular tax ordinance or rule to a specific set of facts or a specific  situation of the taxpayer or tax collector.  Any taxpayer or tax collector may request from  the Department a private letter ruling as to its particular situation. This request must be in  the format specified in Section 6 below.  In addition, in general:      A request for a private letter ruling must be made by, or on behalf of, an  identified taxpayer or tax collector.  A request for private letter ruling may be made by a  taxpayer  or  tax  collector,  or  by  a  representative  of  a  taxpayer  or  tax  collector  under  a  power of attorney.  The Department will not issue private letter rulings to taxpayer or tax  collector representatives for anonymous or unidentified taxpayers or tax collectors.   (a)   (b)   (c)   (d)   (e)   If there is case law or there are rules, which are dispositive of the subject   A private letter ruling will not be issued on alternative plans of proposed       transactions or hypothetical situations.      A private letter ruling will not be issued, if the taxpayer or tax collector is  under audit or other investigation by the Department, unless the Department agrees that  the ruling should be issued to assist with the audit or other investigation.      Private  letter  rulings  will  not  be  issued  to  business,  trade,  or  industrial  associations, or to similar groups concerning the application of tax laws to members of  the  groups.    Members  of  such  groups  may  submit  suggestions  of  general  issues  that  would  be  appropriately  addressed  in  information  bulletins,  or  may  submit  general  questions to be addressed by the Department in a general information letter.      of the request, the Department will decline to issue a private letter ruling on the subject.      (f)  Whether to issue a private letter ruling in response to a private letter ruling  request is within the discretion of the Department.  The Department will respond to all  requests for private letter rulings either by issuance of an opinion or by a letter explaining  that the request will not be honored.      For a private letter ruling, a taxpayer or tax collector must submit a  letter to the Tax Policy Section of the Department (see below) including the following  information:      A complete statement of the facts and other information pertinent to the  request.    The  request  must  contain  a  complete  statement  of  all  material  facts.    The  material  facts  include  the  identification  of  all  interested  parties,  a  statement  of  the  business reasons for the transaction, and a detailed description of the transaction.  The  request must contain an analysis of the relations of the material facts to the issues;      A statement of authorities supporting the taxpayer’s views, an explanation  of the grounds for that conclusion and the relevant authorities to support that conclusion;      A  statement  of  any  authorities  contrary  to  the  taxpayer’s  views.    Each  taxpayer is under an affirmative duty to identify any and all authorities contrary to the  taxpayer’s views.  If the taxpayer determines that there are no authorities contrary to its  views,  or  the  taxpayer  is  unable  to  locate  such  authority,  the  request  must  contain  a  statement to that effect;      documents relevant to the request;     (d)   Copies  of  all  contracts,  licenses,  agreements,  instruments  or  other   (b)   (c)   Section 6.   (a)   (e)   Section 7.      Signature  of  the  taxpayer  (or  one  of  its  officers),  or  the  taxpayer’s  representative.  A taxpayer’s signature must be under penalty of perjury.  A taxpayer’s  representative must also provide a properly executed power of attorney.      The letter must state that the taxpayer or tax collector is requesting a private letter  ruling from the Department and be addressed to the Tax Policy Section, City of Chicago,  Department  of  Revenue,  Room  300,  DePaul  Center,  333  South  State  Street,  Chicago,  Illinois 60604-3977.  If the Department believes that sufficient information is lacking or  that one or more of the above requirements is not present, it can refuse to issue a private  letter ruling.      Private  letter  rulings  shall  be  the  official  position  of  the  Department as to the specific factual situation presented by the taxpayer or tax collector  and will have no effect on any other set of facts or on other taxpayers or tax collectors.   Private letter rulings must be signed by the Corporation Counsel’s Office in order to be  effective.      A private letter ruling may be relied upon by the taxpayer or tax  collector in determining its tax liability; however, reliance upon private letter rulings is  subject to the provisions of Section 12 below.  Private opinions will be open to the public,  except for the name of the taxpayer or tax collector and other confidential facts identified  by the taxpayer or tax collector, which will be redacted from the public’s copy.      Private letter rulings will cease to bind the Department if there is a  pertinent  change  in  statutory  law,  case  law,  rules  or  material  facts.    In  certain  rare  circumstances,  it  will  be  necessary  for  the  Department  to  expressly  revoke  a  private  opinion previously issued to a taxpayer or tax collector.  In the case of such a revocation,  the taxpayer or tax collector will incur no liability for any tax, penalty or interest as a  result  of  reliance  on  the  private  letter  ruling  up  to  the  date  of  the  issuance  of  the  revocation of the private letter ruling.     Section 8.    Section 9.   GENERAL INFORMATION LETTERS   Section 10.    If information is requested by a taxpayer or tax collector, or if a  private letter ruling is denied, the Department, through the Corporation Counsel’s Office,  may issue a general information letter to the taxpayer or tax collector.  This letter is a  statement of the City’s position as to a general area of the law and is not to be considered  a  private  letter  ruling.    Thus,  general  information  letters  may  not  be  relied  upon  by  taxpayers or tax collectors with regard to the application of the law to any particular set  of facts.  General information letters must be signed by the Corporation Counsel’s Office  in order to be effective.     ORAL OPINIONS   Section 11.   In  order  to  be  assured  of  protection,  taxpayers  or  tax  collectors  should not rely on oral opinions from Department employees, or from any other persons         working on behalf of the Department.  Taxpayers and tax collectors will be assured of  protection as to a given set of facts only if the opinion from the Department is a private  letter ruling.  Even then, the opinion ceases to have any effect if the law is changed in any  pertinent respect or if there is a material change in the facts.       RELIANCE ON WRITTEN INFORMATION   OR WRITTEN ADVICE        Section 12.  Chicago Municipal Code Section 3-4-325 provides:  “In the event  that a taxpayer or tax collector demonstrates reasonable reliance upon erroneous written  information or written advice from the department or the corporation counsel, then the  director shall abate any taxes, interest or penalties that result from such information or  advice.”  The forms of “written information or written advice” on which a taxpayer or tax  collector may reasonably rely are limited to rules and regulations, private letter rulings,  general information letters (but not with regard to the application of the law to any  particular set of facts), official information bulletins, and current tax return forms and  instructions.

General Licensing Provisions Ruling # 2005-1  Uniform Revenue Procedures Ruling # 4  Subject:  License Holds for Tax Liabilities  Effective date:  March 1, 2005    Section 1.  Chicago Municipal Code (“Code”) Section 4-4-150(b) provides that, with  certain exceptions set forth in Section 4-4-150(c), “No initial or renewal license shall be  issued to any license applicant who has acquired any outstanding debt, unless and until  such person satisfies all outstanding debts or by authority of the city council discharges  all  such  indebtedness  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  fixed  by  the  city  council.”    Section 2.  Code  Section  4-4-150(c)  provides  that,  notwithstanding  Section  4-4- 150(b),  the  City  may  issue  an  initial  or  renewal  license  if  (1)  the  license  applicant  (“applicant”)  has  entered  into  an  agreement  for  the  payment  of  its  debts  and  is  in  compliance with the agreement; or (2) the applicant is contesting liability for the debts in  a pending audit or administrative or judicial proceeding; or (3) the applicant has filed a  petition in bankruptcy and the debts owed are dischargeable in bankruptcy.    Section 3.  Code Section 4-4-150(a), (1) states that, as used in Section 4-4-150, the  term  “debt”  includes,  among  other  things,  “any  unpaid  tax  liability,  whether  or  not  an  assessment has been issued.”    Section 4.  an “unpaid tax liability” will be deemed to exist only in the following situations:       For the purpose of creating a license hold under Code Section 4-4-150(b),    where a final assessment has been issued and is unpaid; or   a.   b.   c.   a.   b.   where  the  applicant  is  registered  for  a  tax  and  is  delinquent  in  filing  a       complete tax return for that tax, and the delinquency has not been cured; or      where the applicant has filed a tax return which provides information to  the  Department  of  Revenue  (“Department”)  allowing  for  the  computation  of  a  tax  liability  which  after  application  of  all  applicable  payments  and  remittances  leaves  a  deficiency balance due that has not been cured.    Section 5.  For the purpose of creating a license hold under Code Section 4-4- 150(b), an “unpaid tax liability” may be presumed by the Department where the applicant  is  the  subject  of  a  discovery investigation  and  has  failed  to  file  a  tax  return  and  make  payment  which,  based  on  the  nature  of  the  applicant’s  business,  would  ordinarily  be  expected.  After a notice of this presumption is provided to the applicant, the applicant  may  rebut  this  presumption  by  providing  to  the  Department  reliable  information  and  documentation to explain why the applicant has not filed a tax return.      Upon written request of an applicant, where a dispute exists as to whether  or not an applicant has provided sufficient information and documentation to rebut the  presumption described in Section 5(a), the Director of the Department (“Director”) will  refer the matter to the problems resolution committee authorized by Code Section 3-4- 152 (“Committee”), in which case the applicant will be given an opportunity to present  its case informally to the Committee.  Such requests for review shall be submitted to the  Director  within  fourteen  business  days  of  receiving  the  Department’s  notice  of  an  applicant’s failure to rebut the presumption described in Section 5(a).    After the Committee has completed its review, either the Department will confirm that  the  presumption  described  in  this  Section  5  has  been  rebutted,  or  the  Department  may  uphold the presumption.  If the Department confirms that the applicant has successfully  rebutted the presumption of liability, the Department will notify the applicant in writing  and  immediately  remove  its  license  hold  to  allow  the  applicant  to  obtain  required  business  licenses.    The  applicant  shall  acquire  all  applicable  licenses  within  seven  business  days  of  receipt  of  such  notice,  if  in  fact  the  applicable  license  period  has  commenced.    If the Committee upholds a presumption of liability, it shall notify the applicant of this  fact in writing.  Unless the taxpayer files applicable tax returns and makes all applicable  tax payments within 10 days of such notice, the Committee staff shall direct appropriate  Department  personnel  to  issue  a  notice  of  tentative  determination  of  claim.  In  such  instances, the Department shall issue any initial or renewal license if a timely protest of  the tentative determination is filed.        During  the  course  of  the  process  outlined  in  Sections  5(a)  and  (b),  no  notice of violation or cease and desist order will be issued by the Department as a result  of an applicant’s failure to obtain a license strictly due to the presumed liability described  in this Section 5.  Any previously-issued cease and desist orders or notices of violation   c.   shall  be  stayed  during  the  period  of  review  by  the  Committee,  if  the  only  hold  on  the  account is the result of a presumed liability, as described in this Section 5.  No penalties  or fines for the failure to have or display a required license will be accrued or incurred  during any period of review or stay under this provision, if the only hold on the account is  the result of a presumed liability, as described in this Section 5.

Description of Tax   The Chicago Use Tax for Nontitled Personal Property (“Chicago Use Tax” or “   tax”) is imposed upon the privilege of using in the City of Chicago nontitled tangible  personal property purchased at retail on or after January 1, 1992 from a retailer located  outside the City.  The tax is at the rate of one percent of the property’s selling price and  applies whether an item is purchased or used by an individual or a business entity.  (Chicago Municipal Code (“Code”) § 3-27-030).     Every taxpayer is entitled to an annual tax credit of $25 to be applied against the  taxpayer’s aggregate tax liability for each taxable year.  Code § 3-27-040.  Unless the tax  is collected by a retailer, any person liable for tax in an amount greater than the $25  annual credit must pay the tax directly to the Chicago Department of Revenue  (“Department”).  Code § 3-27-070.  Retailers who voluntarily collect the Chicago Use  Tax and timely remit it to the city are allowed a fee in the form of a discount of five  percent of tax collected to defray expenses in collecting and remitting the tax.  Code § 3- 27-080.    2.      effective July 14, 1955, as amended, 35 ILCS 105/1 et seq., generally apply to the  Chicago Use Tax unless (i) a state ruling or regulation relates to a provision of the Illinois  Use Tax Act that differs in substance from the Chicago Use Tax Ordinance for Nontitled  Personal Property (“Chicago Use Tax Ordinance ”) or (ii) the Department has  promulgated a ruling or regulation relating to the same subject.     Published rulings and regulations promulgated under Illinois Use Tax Act,   Application of State Rulings and Regulations   a.   All words or terms used in these Chicago Use Tax regulations that are not   defined in the Chicago Use Tax Ordinance or in the Uniform Revenue Procedures  Ordinance, chapter 3-4 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, as amended, have the meaning  set forth in the Illinois Use Tax Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder.    3.     Effective Date of Tax   For purposes of Section 3-27-030(A) of the Chicago Use Tax Ordinance, the date  of purchase shall be considered the earlier of the (a) date of delivery and (b) the date the  purchase price of the personal property is paid in full.  Therefore, every item of   b.   nonexempt, nontitled tangible personal property purchased at retail from an out-of- Chicago retailer for use in the city, and delivered to the purchaser on or after January 1,  1992, was subject to the Chicago Use Tax unless the item’s purchase price was paid in  full prior to January 1, 1992.    4.     Purchases at Retail from a Retailer   a.   Under the terms of the Chicago Use Tax Ordinance, a purchaser or user is   liable for the Chicago Use Tax if an item of nontitled tangible personal property is  purchased at retail from   a retailer located outside the city for use in the city.   See Code § 3-27-030(A).  For  purposes of the Chicago Use Tax, an item of nontitled tangible personal property is  purchased at retail if the purchaser acquires ownership of, or title to, the property through  a sale at retail.     b.   The terms “sale at retail” and “retailer” have the meanings set forth in   Section 2 of the Illinois Use Tax Act, as amended. In general (and subject to all the  exceptions and conditions contained in the Illinois Use Tax Act, as amended):  (a) “sale  at retail” means any transfer of ownership of, or title to, nontitled tangible personal  property to a purchaser for the purpose of use, and not for the purpose of resale, in any  form as nontitled tangible personal property to the extent not first subject to a use for  which it was purchased; and (b) “retailer” means every person engaged in the business of  making sales at retail.     c.   Examples            (1)  Manufacturer A purchases materials to be used as constituents in  producing steel. Because the materials are deemed to be purchased for the  purpose of resale, rather than for use, under the definition of “sale at  retail,” no tax is due.   Distributor B purchases promotional materials from a supplier   (2)  located outside the City.  Distributor B thereupon transfers the materials  without charge to a Chicago retailer who will use the materials in the city.   Because the sale of the materials to distributor B is a sale at retail, Chicago  Use Tax is due.   Construction contractor C purchases steel and lumber from a   (3)  supplier located in Indiana to be used to construct an office building in the  City.  The construction contractor is liable for Chicago Use Tax on the  purchase price of the steel and lumber.   Depreciation Allowed for Out-of-City Use      5.      tangible personal property is used outside the City before being brought into the City for   Section 3-27-030(C) of the Chicago Use Tax Ordinance states that if nontitled   use in the City, its “selling price” for purposes of computing Chicago Use Tax shall be  reduced by an amount representing a reasonable allowance for depreciation attributable  to the period of out-of-city use.  For  purposes of this provision, depreciation shall be  determined by using the straight line method of  depreciation, and an item’s useful life  shall be as provided in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as amended.  Depreciation shall  be calculated on a monthly basis with no adjustment for fractions of a month.    6.     Credits to Prevent Multiple Taxation   To prevent multiple taxation, a taxpayer who purchases nontitled tangible   personal property for use in the City from a retailer located outside the City may take a  credit equal to any municipal tax due and payable that the taxpayer in fact has paid to  another municipality in any state with respect to the sale, purchase or use of the property,  whether or not the municipal is a home rule tax.  For example, a purchaser of nontitled  tangible personal property may take a credit equal to the amount of Home Rule  Municipal Retailers’ Occupation Tax paid.  No credit may be taken for any part of the  Retailers’ Occupation Tax, 35 ILCS 120/1 et seq., paid to the State of Illinois.    7.     Use Tax Obligation of Lessors   a.   For purposes of the Chicago Use Tax, a lessor of nontitled tangible    personal property is the user of the property.  Therefore, if a person (wherever located)  who will act as lessor purchases nontitled tangible personal property at retail from a  retailer located outside the City, and the property is 1eased to a lessee for use in the  City, the lessor is required to pay the Chicago Use Tax.            b.   Examples   Lessor A purchases a cash register from a manufacturer located   (1)  outside the City which it will lease to a business located in the City.   Lessor A is subject to the Chicago Use Tax on the purchase of the cash  register.   Lessor B, which is located in the suburbs, purchases raw materials   (2)  from a  supplier located outside of Illinois to manufacture photocopying  machines. The raw materials will be incorporated into the final product by  the lessor.  Lessor B thereafter leases the photocopying machines to  businesses for use in the City.  Lessor B must pay Chicago Use Tax on the  purchase price of the raw materials.   Boats     8.       The purchase or use of every boat which is not in fact titled or registered with an  agency of the state of Illinois and which is moored within the corporate limits of the City  is subject to the Chicago Use Tax.     Annual Tax Credit for Married Couples   9.        Section 3-27-040 of the Chicago Use Tax Ordinance provides for an annual tax  credit of $25.  Section 3-27-070 requires every taxpayer that is liable for Chicago Use  Tax in an amount greater than the annual tax credit to file a return with the Department  and pay all applicable tax.  For the purpose of these sections, it shall be presumed that a  married couple shall have no Chicago Use Tax liability and shall not be required to file a  Chicago Use Tax return if the aggregate purchase price of all nonexempt, nontitled  tangible personal property they jointly purchase during a taxable year is $5,000 or less.    10.     Exempt Property   Section 3-27-050 of the Chicago Use Tax Ordinance exempts the following items   of nontitled tangible personal property, and the use thereof, from the Chicago Use Tax:     a.   Items of nontitled tangible personal property which are exempt from tax   under the provisions of the Illinois Use Tax Act, as amended.  Examples of exempt  property include, but are not limited to, pollution control facilities, manufacturing and  assembling machinery and equipment used primarily in the process of manufacturing or  assembling tangible personal property for wholesale or retail sale or lease and graphic  arts machinery and equipment (all as further described by the Illinois Use Tax Act, as  amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder);     b.   Food for human consumption which is to be consumed off the premises   where it is sold (other than alcoholic beverages, soft drinks and food which has been  prepared for immediate consumption); and     c.   Prescription and nonprescription medicines, drugs, medical appliances and   insulin, urine testing materials, syringes and needles used by diabetics, for human use.    11.     Exempt Uses   Section 3-27-060 of the Chicago Use Tax Ordinance exempts the following   purchases and uses of nontitled-tangible personal property from the Chicago Use Tax:     a.   Use in the City of nontitled tangible personal property acquired outside the   City by a nonresident natural individual if the property is brought into the City by the  individual for his or her own use while temporarily in the City or while passing through  the City;     Use of nontitled tangible personal property either by:  (a) an interstate  carrier for hire as rolling stock moving in interstate commerce or (b) a lessor under a  lease of at least one year, executed or in effect at the time of purchase of the property, to  an interstate carrier for hire as rolling stock moving in interstate commerce but only as  long as the property is so used by the interstate carrier for hire;   b.   c.   Use by an owner, lessor or shipper of nontitled tangible personal property     which is utilized by an interstate carrier for hire as rolling stock moving in interstate  commerce but only as long as so used by the interstate carrier for hire;     d.   Temporary storage in the City of nontitled tangible personal property   which is acquired outside the City and which, after being brought into the City and stored  temporarily in the City, (a) is used solely outside the City, (b) is physically attached to, or  incorporated into, other tangible personal property which is used solely outside the City  or (c) is altered by converting, fabricating, manufacturing, printing, processing or shaping  and, as altered, is used solely outside the City;     e.   Temporary storage in the City of building materials and fixtures by a   combination retailer and construction contractor registered with the state of Illinois, but  only if the contractor thereafter incorporates the building materials and fixtures into real  estate located outside the City;     f.   Purchase or use of nontitled tangible personal property by a common   carrier by rail which receives physical possession of the property in the City and which  transports the property, or shares with another common carrier in the transportation of the  property, out of the City on a standard uniform bill of lading showing the seller of the  property as the shipper or consignor of the property to a destination outside the City, for  use outside the City;      Use in the City of nontitled tangible personal property acquired outside  the City by a nonresident natural individual who has used the property outside the City  for at least three months prior to bringing the property into the City; and     g.   h.   Use in the City of nontitled tangible personal property by a business which  relocates to the City, or opens an office, plant or other facility in the City, if the property  had been used at least three months outside the City by the business before being moved  into the City.    12.     Rolling Stock Exemption   The rolling stock exemption contained in section 3-27-060 of the Chicago   Use Tax Ordinance and these regulations may be claimed only if each of the following  three conditions is met: (i) the purchaser or user is either an interstate carrier for hire or a  lessor of nontitled tangible personal property under a lease of one year or longer executed  or in effect at the time of purchase to an interstate carrier for hire; (ii) the property  purchased or used is rolling stock; and (iii) the property is used in the transportation  process in interstate commerce.  It does not apply to nontitled tangible personal property  used by an interstate carrier or lessor solely between points in the City.     a.   b.   Example      Bus company A is an interstate carrier for hire which transports its passengers between  O’Hare Airport and other points in the city.  Bus company A cannot claim the rolling  stock exemption with respect to its purchase or use of rolling stock such as tires for this  purpose because the journeys of its passengers neither originate nor terminate outside the  City.       A lessor that qualifies for the rolling stock exemption is required to pay   c.   the Chicago Use Tax upon expiration of its lease with the interstate carrier for hire and the  reversion of the leased property.  The tax shall be based upon the fair market value of the  property at the time of the property’s reversion and shall be paid on or before the payment  due date set forth in Section 13 of these regulations.   d.   A person claiming the rolling stock exemption must make available to the  Department upon request a copy of the carrier’s Interstate Commerce Commission (or, if  applicable, other federal regulatory agency) Certificate of Authority or Illinois Commerce  Commission Certificate of Authority showing that the carrier is an interstate carrier for  hire.    13.      Filing Returns and Tax Payments Annually or Monthly; Filing Requirements   of Construction Contractors         c.   a.   b.   Unless the tax has been collected by the seller, any person who is liable  for the tax in an amount greater than the annual tax credit of $25.00 for any taxable year  shall file returns with the department and pay all applicable tax to the department as set  forth below.      Taxpayers who are natural individuals and are not engaged in business as  sole proprietors shall file an annual return and pay all applicable tax on or before the last  day of February of each year. The return shall report all taxable purchases and uses for  the preceding calendar year.      For taxpayers that primarily purchase or use nontitled tangible personal  property to be incorporated into real estate (i.e., contractors), (a) all tax returns shall be  filed with the department on an annual basis on or before August 15 of each year in  accordance with Sections 3-4-186 and 3-4-189 of the Code, (b) all tax payments shall be  made in accordance with either Section 3-4-187 (payment of actual tax liabilities) or  Section 3-4-188 (payment of estimated taxes), and (c) the provisions of Sections 3-4-186,  3-4-187, 3-4-188 and 3-4-189 shall control over any contrary provisions in chapter 3-27  regarding the subjects covered by those sections.  It shall be presumed, unless proven  otherwise by documentary evidence, that every construction contractor (as that term is  defined by Regulation 130.1940 promulgated under the Retailers’ Occupation Tax, 35  ILCS 120/1 et seq.) is required to file returns and pay the tax as described in this  paragraph.     d.     All other taxpayers (i.e., all taxpayers other than natural individuals, and  real estate building contractors) shall file annual returns and pay all applicable tax on or  before August 15 of each year.      engage in a business making them responsible for paying the tax must file a final return  and pay all applicable tax within 30 days after discontinuing the business.     Notwithstanding paragraphs c and d above, all taxpayers that cease to   e.   f.   All tax returns required by the Chicago Use Tax Ordinance shall be filed   with the Chicago Department of Revenue -- not the Illinois Department of Revenue.

Description of Tax      Effective  January  1,  1992,  the  Chicago  Telecommunications  Tax  (Chicago  Municipal  Code  (“M.C.C.”)  chapter  3-70)  (hereafter  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  “Telecommunications  Tax”)    was  imposed  on  the  act  or  privilege  of  originating  or  receiving  telecommunications  in  the  city  of  Chicago  at  a  rate  of  5%  of  gross  charges.   Effective January 1, 1998, the Chicago Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance  Fee (M.C.C. chapter 3-75) (hereafter sometimes referred to as the “IMF”) was imposed  on  the  act  or  privilege  of  originating  or  receiving  telecommunications  in  the  city  of  Chicago  at  a  rate  of  2%  of  gross  charges.    Effective  January  1,  2003,  the  Chicago  Simplified Telecommunications Tax (M.C.C. chapter 3-73) (hereafter sometimes referred  to as “the Simplified Tax” or  “tax”) replaced the Telecommunications Tax and  the IMF.   The  rate  of  the  Simplified  Tax  is  7%  of  gross  charges.    In  general,  the  terms  of  the  Simplified Tax are essentially the same as those of the Telecommunications Tax.     The  tax  is  imposed  on  the  act  or  privilege  of  originating  or  receiving  telecommunications  in  the  city  of  Chicago.    The  tax  applies  to  both  intrastate  telecommunications (telecommunications that originate and terminate within the state of  Illinois)  and  interstate  telecommunications  (telecommunications  that  either  originate  or  terminate outside Illinois).  The tax rate is 7% of the gross charge for telecommunications  purchased at retail from a retailer.  (Municipal Code of Chicago, hereinafter “M.C.C.,” 3- 73-030.)  Every telecommunications retailer maintaining a place of business in Illinois,  which is subject to the jurisdiction of the city, must collect the tax from its customers  who originate or receive telecommunications in Chicago. (M.C.C., 3-73-040.)   Retailers  must register with the department of revenue (M.C.C., 3-73-060) and (in general, subject  to the provisions of M.C.C., 3-4-186, 3-4-187, 3-4-188 and 3-4-189) remit the tax to the  department on a monthly basis.  (M.C.C., 3-73-050.)  Retailers who remit the tax in a  timely manner may retain 1.0% of the tax collected to reimburse them for collection and  remittance expenses.  (M.C.C., 3-73-40(D).)        2.  Prepaid Telephone Calling Arrangements    Prepaid telephone calling arrangements are not considered telecommunications     subject to the Simplified Telecommunications Tax.  They are instead subject to state and  local sales taxes.  ""Prepaid telephone calling arrangements"" means the right to  exclusively purchase telephone or telecommunications services that must be paid for in  advance and enable the origination of one or more intrastate, interstate, or international  telephone calls or other telecommunications using an access number, an authorization   code, or both, whether manually or electronically dialed, for which payment to a retailer  must be made in advance, provided that, unless recharged, no further service is provided  once that prepaid amount of service has been consumed.  Prepaid telephone calling  arrangements include the recharge of a prepaid calling arrangement.  For purposes of this  Section, ""recharge"" means the purchase of additional prepaid telephone or  telecommunications services whether or not the purchaser acquires a different access  number or authorization code.  ""Prepaid telephone calling arrangement"" does not include  an arrangement whereby a customer purchases a payment card and pursuant to which the  service provider reflects the amount of the purchase as a credit on an account for a  customer under an existing subscription plan.          Meaning of “Gross Charge”   3.      The  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  is  imposed  upon  the  gross  charge for telecommunications.  (M.C.C., 3-73-030(A).)  The term “gross charge” means  the amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in  the city of Chicago and for all services provided in connection therewith by a retailer,  valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services  and property of every kind or nature. No deduction may be taken on account of the cost  of the telecommunications, the cost of materials used, labor or service cost or any other  expense whatsoever.  (M.C. C., 3-73-020(F).)  If a retailer provides services that are not  necessary  for,  or  directly  related  to,  the  retailer’s  provision  of  telecommunications  to  customers, and the charges for these services are disaggregated and separately identified  from  other  charges,  then  the  retailer  need  not  include  the  charges  in  gross  charges.   Examples of these services may include directory advertising, specialized designing or  engineering  services,  specialized  security  measures  and  consulting  services.    ""Gross  charges""  for  private  line  service  include  charges  imposed  at  each  channel  point  within  Illinois, charges for the channel mileage between each channel point within Illinois, and  charges for that portion of the interstate inter-office channel provided within Illinois.                4.   Customer Equipment Charges   Gross  charges  do  not  include  charges  for  customer  equipment  including  equipment  that  is  leased  or  rented  by  the  customer  from  any  source,  but  only  if  the  charges are disaggregated and separately identified from other charges. (M.C.C., 3-73- 020(F)(4).)    For  purposes  of  this  provision,  customer  equipment  includes,  but  is  not  limited to, all items generally classified as customer equipment or terminal equipment,  such  as  telephone  instruments  and  station  sets,  dialers,  modems,  private  branch  exchanges (PBX’s), inside wiring, facsimile machines and pagers.  Although charges for  customer equipment may not be subject to the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications  Tax, the lease or rental of customer equipment may be subject to the Chicago Personal  Property Lease Transaction Tax.  (M.C.C., chapter 3-32.)     5.  Computer-Related Charges     Charges for automated data storage, retrieval and processing services or for the  use of computer time or other equipment are not included in gross charges.  (M.C.C., 3- 73-020(F)(3).)  Automated information retrieval or data processing charges also are not  included in gross charges.  For example, customers who access on-line computer data  bases are subject to the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax on the charge for  the transmission of the data, but not on the charge for the data processing or inquiry.  If a  telecommunications retailer provides both transmission and data processing services,  however, the charge for the data processing services will be subject to the tax unless it is  disaggregated and separately identified on billing statements and in the books and records  of the retailer.  In addition, customers who access on-line computer data bases may be  subject to the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax.  (M.C.C., chapter 3-32;  Meites v. City of Chicago, 184 Ill.App.3d 887, 540 N.E.2d 973 (1st Dist. 1989).)     6.   Value-Added Services           Value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act   Generally, persons that provide customers access to the Internet (""Internet Service   on the form, content, code and protocol of information for purposes other than  transmission are not subject to the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax.   (M.C.C., 3-7 3-020(Q)(2).)  For example, charges for computer data, and protocol  conversions (permitting computers to exchange data, regardless of the language or  protocol a computer’s out-put may be in) are not subject to the tax.  To avoid taxation,  however, charges for these services must be disaggregated and separately stated.   Furthermore, charges for services that are provided for the purposes of transmission are  subject to the tax, even if the form, content, code or protocol of the information is acted  upon in the course of providing the services.  Thus, for example, charges for the service  commonly referred to as “Voice Over Internet Protocol” (or “VOIP”) are subject to the  tax.      Providers"" or ""ISPs"") and who do not, as part of that service, charge customers for the  line or other transmission charges that are used to obtain access to the ISP's server or  other point of access, are not considered to be telecommunications retailers from these  activities.  This is the case so long as such ISPs do not, as part of their billing, charge  customers for such line charges and instead pay their telecommunications suppliers all  transmission costs that they incur in providing the Internet service.  In this situation, an  ISP's customer pays his telecommunications supplier for all transmission costs incurred  while using the service.  The single monthly fee charged by the ISP, which often  represents a flat charge for a package of items including Internet access, e-mail, and  electronic newsletters, would generally not be subject to tax.  If, however, the ISP  charges customers for line or other transmission charges, then it should provide its  telecommunications suppliers with Certificates of Resale and should collect and remit the  tax.  For example, if an ISP provides customers with Internet access, as described in this  section, but also provides customers the use of a 1-800 service to access the ISP, and  separately assesses customers per minute charges for the use of the 1-800 service, then  the ISP is considered a telecommunications retailer and incurs telecommunications tax on   the charges made for the 1-800 service.  If the charges are not disaggregated as provided  in subsection (c), then all charges are subject to the telecommunications tax.     7.  Advertising Revenue   Gross  charges  do  not  include  advertising  revenue  either  from  directory  sales  (such as “yellow pages”) or from message additions to telecommunications. For example,  revenues from an advertising message preceding a time/weather call are not included in  gross charges.     8.  Certain Services Included in Gross Charges   Gross charges include, but are not limited to, charges for unlisted or unpublished  numbers, operator assistance, directory information, call-waiting, call-forwarding, burglar  alarm services and answering services provided by telecommunications retailers.     9.   “900” Numbers                                       The Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax applies to telephone calls made  to 900 numbers if the caller is located in Chicago and receives a billing at the caller’s  service address.  The telecommunications retailer, however, is required to collect the tax  only  upon  the  line  charge.    The  invoice  to  the  caller  for  a  900  number  call  need  not  separately  state  the  line  charge  and  tax.    For  example,  a  call  to  a  900  code  number  is  made to register an opinion in a poll. The caller is billed $1.00. The $0.80 transmission  charge  is  retained  by  the  telecommunications  retailer,  and  $0.20  is  given  to  the  poll  tabulator.  $0.80 is included in gross charges.     10.  Information and Entertainment Services   Gross charges include the transmission charges for information or entertainment  services  such  as  time/weather,  gab  line/party  line  and  other  public  announcement  services.  However, charges for the message content or information of these services are  not included in gross charges.     11 .  Persons Selling to Retailer’s Customers   a.   If a telecommunications retailer receives billing and collection fees  from  persons  selling  services  or  products  to  the  retailer’s  customers,  and  these  fees are billed and collected by the telecommunications retailer, the fees are not  included in gross charges.  For example, a call to a 900 code number is billed by  the telecommunications retailer as follows:    $25.00 - purchase price charged to   caller for product or service    $ 0.35 - call charge ($0.20 call, $0.15   billing and collection fee).   Only the $0.20 charged for the telephone call is included in gross charges and subject to  the tax.     b.   The  following  fees  also  are  not  included  in  gross  charges:    (i)  billing and collection fees paid by persons selling services or products directly to  a telecommunications retailer’s customers; and (ii) billing and collection fees paid  by  a  telecommunications  retailer  to  a  credit  card  company  whose  holders  have  charged calls.   12.  Other Taxes                               Gross  charges  do  not  include  the  taxes  imposed  by  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  Ordinance,  the  Illinois  Telecommunications  Excise  Tax  Act,  section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the charges imposed on consumers for 911  service.  (M.C.C., 3-73-020(F) (1).)         13.  Exemption for State Governments and Universities   The  exemption  for  state  governments  and  state  universities  created  by  statute  extends  only  to  telecommunications  they  purchase  for  their  own  use.  (M.C.C.,  3-73  - 020(N)(1).)  They are not exempt from the obligation to collect and remit tax on sales of  telecommunications  to  others  when  they  act  as  retailers  of  telecommunications.    For  example, a state university is exempt from the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications  Tax  on  purchases,  by  the  university,  of  telecommunications  for  use  by  its  faculty  and  staff in the course of their duties.  However, the university is required to collect and remit  tax on sales of telecommunications to students in university dormitories.     14.  Retailers and Resellers of Telecommunications   a.   Retailers  of  telecommunications  are  persons  who  engage  in  the  business of making sales of telecommunications at retail.  (M.C.C., 3-73-020(L),  (N).)  Telecommunications retailers include, but are not limited to, persons that  operate  or  provide  radio  repeater  services,  paging  services,  radio  dispatch  services, facsimile transmission services and party line services.   b.   of   are   Resellers   telecommunications   considered  telecommunications retailers and, therefore, are required to collect and remit the  Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax based upon the gross charges they  receive  for  telecommunications.    In  the  event  that  a  retailer  who  resells  telecommunications has paid the tax to a local exchange carrier or other retailer,  the reseller may make an application (including supporting documentation) to the  department for a credit memorandum.  Telecommunications resellers include, but  are not limited to, universities and hotels.    15.  Mobile Operations Reporting Option   a.     Retailers  of  telecommunications  who  provide  cellular  phone,  mobile radio, paging or other services, where the customer’s service address is in  fact not a fixed site but rather a motor vehicle or other mobile location, shall use  the customer’s place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications  Sourcing Conformity Act, Public Law 106-252, as amended from time to time,  which as of January 1, 2003 provides that the “place of primary use” means the  street  address  representative  of  where  the  customer’s  use  of  the  mobile  telecommunications service primarily occurs, and which further provides that this  means the residential street address or the primary business street address of the  customer within the licensed service area of the home service provider.  For air- to-ground  systems  and  the  like,  ""service  address""  shall  mean  the  location  of  a  taxpayer's  primary  use  of  the  telecommunications  equipment  as  defined  by  telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.  (M.C.C., 3-73--020(O).)     Retailers    should  not    apportion  gross  charges  based  upon  the  physical  location  of  a  mobile  portable  telecommunications  device  at  the  time  service  is  provided.  For  example,  a  retailer  providing  service  to  a    place  of  primary use in Chicago must collect Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax  on all telecommunications billed to  the customer.    16.  Interstate and International Telecommunications   b.   a.   Obligation of agents.  If a local exchange carrier acting as an agent   of a long distance carrier, inter-exchange carrier, alternative operator service or  billing and collections contractor (a) bills local customers for long distance  service, local service and the taxes applicable for those services and (b) remits a  portion of the collections to its principal, then the local exchange carrier or retailer  must remit tax to the department of revenue only for the amounts it retains. The  local exchange carrier or retailer is required to maintain billing and accounting  data and to provide the data to the department of revenue upon request.   b.   Obligation  of  principals.    Principals  are  responsible  for  remitting  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  on  all  amounts  paid  over  to  them  by  their  agents.    Long  distance  carriers,  inter-exchange  carriers  and  other  retailers who retain local exchange carriers or other agents in Illinois to bill and  collect  gross  charges  from  Chicago  customers  are  considered  to  be  retailers   Interstate telecommunications means all telecommunications that either originate  or  terminate  outside  Illinois.  This  term  includes  telecommunications  that  originate  or  terminate  outside  the  United  States  of  America.  Consumers  paying  a  foreign  tax  on  telecommunications  may  file  a  claim  for  credit  with  the  department  of  revenue  in  the  same manner as with taxes paid to other municipalities. (M.C.C., 3-73-020(G); M.C.C.,  3-73-030(B).)     17.  Responsibility for Accounting and Payment of Tax                       maintaining a place of business in this state.  Thus, they are required to register  with the department and file returns.   c.   Collection fee.  The 1.0% commission authorized by M.C.C., 3-73-   040(D) may be claimed only by the retailer filing a return with the department of  revenue, not by the billing agent, unless the agent also files a remittance return on  behalf of the retailer and remits the applicable tax.    18.  Bad Debts   Gross  charges  do  not  include  bad  debts.    However,  if  any  portion  of  a  debt  deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the telecommunications retailer must report and  pay the tax on that portion of the debt paid during the reporting period. (M.C.C., 3-73- 020(F)(7).)  For purposes of this provision, the term “bad debt” means any portion of a  debt that is related to a sale at retail, for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible  or  excludable,  that  has  become  worthless  or  uncollectible  as  determined  by  relevant  federal income tax standards. (M.C.C., 3-73-020(F).)                19.  Credits        A consumer who has paid both the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax  and a similar tax imposed by another municipality on the same transmission may file a  claim  for  credit  with  the  department  of  revenue.    The  claim  must  be  accompanied  by  documentation  showing  the  taxes  charged  to the  taxpayer  and  relating  the  taxes  to  the  specific call or transaction.  A credit may be available in Chicago to the extent of the tax  imposed  by  the  other  municipality,  if  actually  paid,  but  not  exceeding  the  Chicago  Simplified Telecommunications Tax paid. (M.C.C., 3-73-030(B).)     20.  Application of State Rulings and Regulations    Published   regulations   and   rulings   promulgated     Illinois  Telecommunications  Excise  Tax  Act  (35  ILCS  630/1  et  seq.)  apply  to  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  unless  (1)  a  state  ruling  or  regulation  relates  to  a  provision  of  the  Illinois  Telecommunications  Excise  Tax  Act  that  differs  in  substance  from  the  Chicago  Simplified  Telecommunications  Tax  Ordinance  or  (2)  the  city’s  department  of  revenue  has  promulgated  a  ruling  or  regulation  relating  to  the  same  subject.     under   the   21.   Federal Regulatory Classifications   In the absence of a statute or judicial decision expressly and clearly providing       otherwise, the regulatory classification of a service shall not be controlling as to the  treatment of the service under the Chicago Simplified Telecommunications Tax  Ordinance, and the terms of the Ordinance and these regulations shall control instead.     "

General Information The Chicago Telecommunications Tax is imposed upon:  (1) the act or privilege of originating in the city or receiving in the city intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of seven percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail; and (2) the act or privilege of originating in the city or receiving in the city interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of seven percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail.  Are DSL charges subject to the Chicago Telecommunications Tax? As of July 1, 2008, DSL services purchased, used, or sold by a provider of Internet access to provide Internet access are no longer subject to the Chicago Telecommunications Tax.  Please note that these charges were taxable prior to July 1, 2008 and should be reported and paid to the Department. Are non-providers of Internet access subject to the tax?  DSL services not purchased, used, or sold by a provider of Internet access are not affected and remain subject to the Chicago Telecommunications Tax.  How do I cancel my registration for the Chicago Telecommunications Tax?

ICC,  Case  No.  98  CH  05500  in  the  Circuit  Court  of  Cook  County, the customers of all wireless telecommunications retailers, and the customers of  all  other  telecommunications  retailers  (such  as  resellers)  that  do  not  own  substantial  equipment  in  the  public  way  (such  wireless  and  other  telecommunications  retailers  hereafter referred to collectively as “wireless retailers”) were entitled to pay a reduced  telecommunications tax rate of 6.5%, rather than the full rate of 7% that would otherwise  apply pursuant to Chicago Municipal Code Section 3-73-030.     Pursuant  to  the  settlement,  the  reduced  tax  rate  was  to  remain  in  effect  for  wireless  retailers until $30.3 million in savings were realized, at which time the Department would  provide at least 60 days' written notice to wireless retailers that they must again collect  and remit the full rate of the telecommunications tax.    This notice is made pursuant that agreement. The agreed $30.3 million in savings have  been realized and all wireless retailers must again collect and remit the full rate of the  telecommunications tax (seven percent) as of June 1, 2009.      The  Chicago  Department  of  Revenue  will  change  your  registration  for  tax  code  7512  (6.5% reduced rate) to code 7501 (7% full rate) on the final effective date. You need take  no further action. Your company will be expected to file one 7512 reduced rate tax return  covering the period July 1, 2008 through May 31, 2009 and one 7501 tax return covering  June 1, 2009 through June 30, 2009.     As there are now two full months to implement this increase, we anticipate all collectors  are able to make required changes to their system in a timely manner. If however, you  will incur problems with a June 1, 2009 effective date, please advise us at:     Chicago Department of Revenue   Tax Policy Section   333 S State Street, Room 300  Chicago, Illinois 60604-3977

If you have questions or need more information, please write us.  Our address is:  City of Chicago Department of Revenue Tax Policy Division c/o Raul Medina 333 South State Street, Suite 300 Chicago, Illinois 60604-3977 rmedina@cityofchicago.org  #Chicago Tire Fee  Is the Tire Fee applied to the warranty replacement of defective tires (tires that are replaced under manufacture warranty or road hazzard warranty)?  In the case of a 100% replacement there is no fee applied because the customer pays nothing for the exchange, and it is therefore not a sale at retail.  There is however, a full $1.00 fee in the case of pro-rata replacements, because the customer does pay something, making this transaction a sale at retail.  Are mail order sales subject to the fee?  No.  Is sales tax applied to the tire fee?  No, the tire fee is independent of any sales tax imposed on the sale price of the tires.  How often is the tire fee remitted and when are returns due?  The fee is to be remitted monthly with fees collected in one month payable by the last day of the subsequent month.  The fee return for periods commencing on July 1st of each year and ending on June 30 of the subsequent year, is filed annually and is due by August 15th of each year.  TO:  Retail Sellers of New Tires  The purpose of this informational bulletin is to discuss certain issues pertaining to the Chicago Tire Fee, Chicago Municipal Code Section 11-4-142.  General Information  On and after July 1, 2005, any person selling new tires at retail or offering new tires for retail sale in the City shall collect from retail customers a fee of $1.00 per new tire sold at retail and delivered in the City to be paid to the Department.  Is this tax imposed in conjunction with the sale of motor vehicles?  No, the fee is applied in instances where tires are sold separately and not in conjunction with the sale of a motor vehicle.  What tires qualify for the Tire Fee?  The fee applies to the sale of tires to be used for vehicles defined in Section 1-217 of the Illinois Vehicle Code along with aircraft tires, special mobile equipment, and implements of husbandry.  Are used or reprocessed tires subject to the fee ?  No. Neither used nor reprocessed tires are subject to the new fee.  What is a reprocessed tire?  A reprocessed tire is a tire that has been recapped, retreaded, or regrooved and that has not been placed on a wheel rim.

A: - You must purchase and display a city vehicle sticker within 30 days of  becoming a resident of Chicago.  Vehicles that do not display a current city  sticker are subject to a $120.00 ticket.  City stickers may be purchased from the  Office of the City Clerk. Please click here for more information from the Office of  the City Clerk’s Website.    Q: - What are the requirements for license plates in Illinois?    A: - State law requires license plates in Illinois be affixed to both the front and  rear of passenger vehicles.  Other types of vehicles can be subject to this  requirement as well.  The Illinois Secretary of State requires purchase of annual  license plate renewal stickers that must be affixed to the rear license plate as  proof of current registration.  Vehicles that do not display current license plate  registration stickers are subject to a $50.00 ticket.   Please click here for more  information from the Illinois Secretary of State’s Website.    Q: - What is a residential parking permit?    A: - Some Chicago neighborhoods are zoned for residential parking.  Residential  parking zones limit parking to residents and their guests during specified hours.  This program helps to promote on-street parking for residents of densely  populated areas.  Residents must purchase and display a residential parking  permit for each vehicle that may be parked on the street in a residential zone.   Temporary permits are available for purchase by residents who can then  distribute them to guests and visitors.  Vehicles failing to display the proper  residential zone permit are subject to a $60.00 ticket.  Please click here for more  information from the Office of the City Clerk’s Website.    Q: - Are their special requirements for pick up trucks and vans?    A: - Your truck or van may be required to display a special permit to park on the  street in wards allowing truck and van parking.  Trucks and vans that fail to  display the proper permit are subject to a $120.00 ticket.  There are wards that  do not allow truck or van parking at all.  Please click here for more information  from the Office of the City Clerk’s Website.
