Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance means that the City will not ask about your immigration  status, disclose that information to authorities, or, most importantly, deny you City services  based on your immigration status.    Why does Chicago choose not to partner with Immigrations Customs Enforcement to  deport undocumented individuals?     Partnering with ICE would go against our mission to make Chicago the most immigrant friendly  city in the country and turn ours into a community of fear for immigrants. Furthermore,  enforcing immigration law would take away needed resources and time from the Chicago Police  Department. The Welcoming City Ordinance in fact helps CPD combat crime by allowing all  victims to call the police and all witnesses to come forward without fear of being caught and  deported.     Are there any circumstances in which undocumented individuals will be detained by the  Chicago Police Department?    The only situations in which Chicago will detain undocumented individuals are if they are  wanted on a criminal warrant by local or federal authorities, if they have been convicted of a  serious crime and remain in the United States illegally, or if they are otherwise a clear threat to  public safety or national security.     Will Chicago’s commitment to immigrants be affected by the President-Elect’s anti- Muslim rhetoric and his proposal to withhold funds from Sanctuary Cities?    As Mayor Rahm Emanuel has repeatedly reinforced, Chicago’s status as a welcoming city for  immigrants is not and will never be shaken. We will not cower to intimidations and refuse to  back down as Washington fails to enact comprehensive immigration reform.

Austin  Chairman, Committee on the Budget and Government Operations           To:           October 31, 2012   121   Request for Information from Annual Appropriation Committee Hearing   Sandra Alfred  Executive Director  Commission on Animal Care and Control   Maria Guerra  Mayor’s Office of Legislative Counsel and Government Affairs     From:             CC:      Date:      Re:    Ref ID:      The attached information is in response to questions posed at our department’s hearing on  October 24, 2012 to discuss the 2013 budget.      Alderman John Arena, of the 45th Ward requested information relating to dog bite investigations  by Animal Care and Control (ACC).     ACC investigates dog bites reported to the Chicago Police Department. The preliminary bite  investigation involves interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence to determine whether  violations of the Municipal Code of Chicago have occurred.  Every animal that bites must be  taken to a licensed veterinarian to be observed for signs of rabies for 10 days.     Where an animal has caused serious injury or shown a pattern of aggressive behavior, ACC  performs a dangerous dog investigation to determine if the attacking animal is safe to remain in  Chicago.  If circumstances warrant, ACC can impound the animal during the investigation.  If  the dog is determined to be dangerous, ACC may impose ownership restrictions to reduce the  possibility of future incidents.    Chapter 7-12 of the Municipal Code of Chicago outlines both the penalty for failing to restrain  one’s animal and the process of determining whether an animal is dangerous.    As always, please let me know if you have any further questions.
