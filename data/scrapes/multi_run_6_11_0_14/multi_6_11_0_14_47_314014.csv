Commissioner’s  Update:  As  we  are  very  much  aware,  we  inaugurated  a  new  President  since  our last meeting.  Commissioner Morita provided some updates on CDPH’s work as a result of  the new administration.     New Administration     CDPH continues to  work to  ensure the positive impacts  we have seen as a result of the  Affordable  Care  Act  are  not  repealed.  This  has  included  sharing  information  with  our  Congressional Delegation and working with partners to ensure more people are aware of  all the ways  we have been impacted  – not  just in  getting more people insurance, but  in  providing  us  with  direct  funds  that  have  helped  our  immunization,  lead  and  food  protection programs.     Sheri  Cohen  from  our  team  will  present  today  on  the  ACA  more  in  depth,  but  as  a  preview,  I  wanted to  share an article on the effects  of the ACA for our department  that  was featured in the Tribune last week.     As you have probably seen in the media, Mayor Emanuel has reiterated the important of  immigrants  and  refugees  to  Chicago  and  has  pledged  to  uphold  Chicago’s  status  as  a  Sanctuary City. Our staff has been instructed to reiterate this commitment to our clients  and we have created new signage in multiple languages, including Arabic and Urdu that  will  be  at  all  our  clinic  sites  in  the  coming  week  reminding  residents  that  “All  Are  Welcome.”     Though  the  President  has  repeatedly  threatened  to  cut  federal  funding  to  cities  that  welcome  all  immigrants,  we  have  received  no  word  regarding  this  threat  and  given  the  various  legal  questions  involved,  we  will  continue  to  operate  under  the  assumption  that  all  federal  contracts  will  continue  to  be  met.  That  said,  we  are  watching  this  situation  closely, as we are watching other emerging situations, and will provide any updates if and  when they occur.     Flu Season  It is  flu season. We have seen an uptick in cases, which  is par for the course this time of  year.  However, flu season has not  been as severe as the most recent  past  thus  far.  But  there are still  several weeks left. The good news is the two most common strains of flu we are seeing this year  are included in the vaccine. If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet, please do.    Mental Health  In  January,  Commissioner  Morita  joined  the  Mental  Health  Response  Steering  Committee  to  launch our first Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training for community members. We announced  plans to train more than 400 community leaders in Austin, Lawndale and Garfield Park so they  are able to better able to respond to a mental health crisis, access the city’s mental health services  and  request  a  CIT  first  responder.  This  is  part  of  our  comprehensive  effort  to  strengthen  the  city’s  overall  behavioral  health  response  system  and  follows  training  already  provided  to  Aldermanic offices and all OEMC dispatchers.    Public Works  Commissioner Morita reported they are seeing more public works projects and programs across  our sister agencies that will positively impact public health. Specifically, the city recently      Chicago Board of Health   Meeting Summary: February 15, 2017  DePaul Center, 333 South State Street   announced  modernization  for  the  Garfield  Green  line  and  Garfield  Gateway  project,  as  well  as  the modernization of the Red and Purple lines, following the improvements already made to the  Southside branch of the Red line. Additionally, there is  a new pilot  program  to  develop  vacant  homes in neighborhoods in need and the expansion of youth mentoring programs that the Mayor  announced  last  month  –  all  of  which  directly  align  directly  with  the  goals  of  Healthy  Chicago  2.0.    CDPH Recognition     For  the  second  year  in  a  row,  Chicago  has  been  named  one  of  the  nation’s  top  25  innovators by Harvard University. This year we were honored for the predictive analytics  model  developed  by  DoIT  and  used  by  our  food  protection  team  to  identify  restaurants  most likely to have critical health code violations. The model has allowed us to prioritize  those inspections, identifying problems faster and helping owners comply with the code  more quickly.     This morning, CityHealth, a project of the de Beaumont Foundation, will announce that  Chicago  is  a  gold-level  city  –  the  highest  rating.  This  was  determined  based  on  an  assessment of city policies and efforts around nine evidence-based topic areas that boost  people’s well-being, including the social determinants of health.      Additional updates reported:      Chicago  was  ranked  the  most  bike-friendly  city  in  the  United  States  according  to  the   Bicycling magazine.       Healthy Chicago 2.0 is serving as template to other health organizations and agencies.     Violence is a priority in Healthy Chicago 2.0 and CDPH’s violence prevention program   is working with varies departments and agencies.     Marilta  White,  Director  of  Violence  Prevention  will  be  asked  to  attend  an  up-coming  meeting  to  provide  information  and  status  on  the  violence  programs  and  activities  currently being worked on.      Comments  by  the  Board  President:    Dr.  Lopez  welcomed  the  students  and  provided  an  overview of the board’s history and explained the board’s advisory role in matters of infectious  disease and health issues affecting public health.      Presentation: Potential Impacts of ACA Repeal Sheri Cohen, Senior Healthy Planning Analyst    Policy Update:  None    New Business: The Chicago Board of Health passed a resolution in support of immigrant rights,  calling  on  all  medical  and  healthcare  providers  in  Chicago  to  adopt  policies  and  procedures  to  actively  protect  immigrants.  The  resolution  also  reiterates  Mayor  Rahm  Emanuel's  recent  commitment that Chicago is and will remain a Welcoming City for all of its residents.      Old Business: None    Public Comment: None     Adjourn: The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m.    Next Board Meeting: Wednesday, March 15, 2017 at 9:00 a.m.

9809`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/Vandalism/Vandalism201005.pdf`Success`Success`1`1`Not a fillable PDF.`       Revenue Department Comments on a Recent Report    Concerning Parking Meter Vandalism      A recent report implied that vandalism is on the rise.  It is not.  Vandalism has actually declined.     During the summer of 2009, the parking meter concessionaire reported only 47 incidents of  vandalism including attempts to willfully damage parking meters.  In the months of May and June,  one vandalized meter was reported by the concessionaire per day.  In July and August, the  concessionaire reported a 50% reduction: only one vandalized meter every two days.      The concessionaire reports that more than 99% of the meter system is operational on average.   Graffiti has remained fairly stable throughout the summer of 2009. Graffiti usually is limited to  “tagging” or the act of writing a name or nickname on a meter, and typically has no impact on the  operation of the meter.  The concessionaire documented about 4.4 incidents per day in May/June  and about 5.5 incidents per day in July/August.       Vandalism or graffiti are nothing new.  The City’s meter mechanics regularly dealt with  intentionally broken and tagged meters.  And Chicago is not alone in this regard.  It takes just a  quick Google search to find cities from coast to coast that have dealt (and will continue to deal)  with vandalism.    Vandalism and graffiti of any kind are not tolerated by businesses and residents.  If you park at a  parking meter that is inoperable or would like to report graffiti on a parking meter, please call the  concessionaire’s 24 hour customer support line at 877.242.7901.  Inoperable or “tagged” parking  meters are addressed in just a few hours, a significant improvement over past years.  All repairs  are made at the concessionaire’s expense.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,442 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Van Buren Street, from  S. Kostner Avenue to S. Keeler Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1891, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Chandler’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Michael Chandler                     24th Ward    1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             Do you wonder what was happening in 1891?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:          Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap   and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.                                                 VAN BUREN WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,442 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Van Buren Street, from S. Kostner Avenue to S. Keeler Avenue     Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1891 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late December 2012. Restoration will follow in late May 2013. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Van Buren outside of our working hours.  When we are  working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able  to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN MICHAEL CHANDLER   773-533-2400      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late December  2012. Restoration will be completed in late May 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you, our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our private contractor has finished preliminary construction work at W. 64th Street and S.  Central Avenue, and at W. 64th Street and S. Major Avenue. Our in-house crews will install new  sewer pipe in W. 64th Street, from S. Central Avenue to S. Major Avenue. The old pipe dates  back to 1928 and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Quinn’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,     Thomas Powers  Commissioner     Cc: Alderman Marty Quinn         13th Ward                                            1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1               SEWER PROJECT   HISTORY        Do you wonder what was happening in 1928?  That’s the year the old sewer was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:             MICKEY MOUSE IN “STEAMBOAT WILLIE”     The first air-conditioned office opened, in San Antonio, Texas.    Mickey Mouse made his first appearance, in the short film “Steamboat Willie”.    Velveeta Cheese was created by Kraft.    Movie director Stanley Kubrick was born.    Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin.    Boston Garden officially opened.    The clip-on tie was designed.             .                          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management’s private contractor has completed preliminary  construction work at W. 64th Street and S. Central Avenue, and at W. 64th Street and S. Major  Avenue. Our in-house crews will now install new sewer pipe in W. 64th Street, from S. Central  Avenue to S. Major Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1928 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by 61st  Street the north, 64th Street on the south, Central Avenue on the east, and Menard Avenue on the  west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:   In-house construction will begin in mid to late March, and is expected to be done in  mid to late April. Final restoration will follow in late May. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:      Safety  is  our  first  consideration.  You  will  always  be  able  to  reach  your  home  or  business. During sewer installation, we will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.   When  we  are  working  in  the  street,  we  may  have  to  close  it  to  traffic  for  reasons  of  safety.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.       CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN MARTY QUINN   773-581-8000      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029             FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS           Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Quinn, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 5,777 feet of 12-inch water main in W. Roosevelt Road, from  S. Albany Avenue to W. Ogden Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1883, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Fioretti’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:           COCO CHANEL      •  The first vaudeville theater opened, in Boston, Massachusetts.  •  French stylist Coco Chanel was born.  •  “Ladies Home Journal” began publication.  •  The world’s first rodeo was held in Pecos, Texas.  •  The Orient Express made its first run.  •  The Brooklyn Bridge in New York opened to traffic.  •  The first international luge race took place in Switzerland.  •  The New York Gotham’s baseball team held the first Ladies Day in professional ball,   allowing women into its ballpark at a reduced rate. Spectators at sporting events had been  virtually all men until this point.                      W. ROOSEVELT RD. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 5,777 feet of 12-inch  water main in W. Roosevelt Road, from S. Albany Avenue to W. Ogden Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1883 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in mid July 2014. This project is being coordinated with IDOT and their  department will complete all final restoration following water main construction. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Roosevelt Road outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN BOB FIORETTI   312-263-9273                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in mid  July 2014. This project is being coordinated with IDOT and their department will complete all  final restoration following water main construction. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.

The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!
