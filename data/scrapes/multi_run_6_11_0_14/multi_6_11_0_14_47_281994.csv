Zafar Sheikh, President   Licensee/Revocation    for the premises located at   4256 West Fullerton      v.

Fullerton.  This matter had gone to a   contested hearing before Deputy Hearing Commissioner Raymond J. Prosser on November 15,   2007, February 7, 2008, March 13, 2008 and April 3, 2008.  The City was represented by   Assistant Corporation Counsel Rachel Berger and 711 Senior Law Student Joseph D. Ackerman.    The licensee was represented at the contested hearing before the Local Liquor Control   Commission by Thomas Erickson of Fitzgerald and Hursey and for oral argument before this   Commission by Timothy J. Fitzgerald.                              1   At the conclusion of the hearing, Deputy Hearing Commissioner Prosser submitted   Findings of Fact that the City=s witnesses were credible and the City had sustained its burden of   proof on Charges 1 and 2, which alleged the licensee gave, sold or delivered alcoholic liquor to a   minor on September 5, 2007, in violation of the City of Chicago Municipal Code and the Liquor   Control Act of the State of Illinois.  Commissioner Prosser recommended revocation based on   the facts of this case and the prior disciplinary history of the licensee which included five   previous sales to minor in the last twelve years.  The Findings of Fact and the recommendation   of revocation were adopted by Mary Lou Eisenhauer.  A copy of the Order of Revocation was   mailed on April 17, 2008, to the licensee and a timely appeal to this Commission was filed on   April 28, 2008.  Oral argument on this matter was heard on July 9, 2008.       At the hearing before Deputy Hearing Commissioner Prosser the licensee made an oral   motion to strike evidentiary testimony based on the argument that the Ainvestigation@ of this   licensed premises was unconstitutional.  Both parties were allowed to prepare and file written   briefs on this issue.  Commissioner Prosser stated in his Findings of Fact that he would make no   ruling on this issue since an administrative agency does not have the authority to decide   constitutional issues.  This Commissioner agrees with Commissioner Prosser and also declines to   make a ruling on the constitutional arguments.  The fact that the Commission allowed oral   argument before it on the constitutional issues should not be interpreted as suggesting it has   jurisdiction to rule on those issues.  Argument was allowed to preserve these issues in the record   for possible appeal.  In addition to the general proposition of law that administrative agencies do   not have the power to rule on constitutional issues, this Commission is a creature of state statute                       2   that specifically states what authority it has in cases of appeals of revocation or suspension.     This Commissioner does not believe that the statute creating the Commission gave it power to   decide constitutional issues.      Under the state statute review by this Commission in revocation cases the Commission is   limited to three questions:    1.  Whether the Mayor, as Local Liquor Control Commissioner, has proceeded in  the manner provided by law;   2.  Whether the order supported the findings;         3.  Whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in light of the  whole record.        There was no argument that the matter did not proceed in the manner provided by law.  There is   no question that there was sufficient substantial evidence to support the findings that the licensee   sold alcohol to a minor in violation of the City of Chicago Municipal Code and the Liquor   Control Act of the State of Illinois.  The licensee=s evidence that its agent sold the alcohol to this   minor only because that agent had previously carded this minor and the minor had produced   identification that she was over 21, is at best evidence for mitigation.  It does not justify the sale   to this minor on this date.  The history of this licensee presented at this hearing shows the   following violations: Sale to Minor on February 15, 1996 and December 22, 1995, which   resulted in a 3-day closing; a Sale to Minor on May 12, 2003, which resulted in a 30-day closing;   a Sale to Minor on March 19, 1999, which resulted in a 14-day closing and a Sale to Minor on   January 16, 2007, which resulted in a Revocation (that revocation was also appealed and heard   separately at the Local Liquor Control Commission and the License Appeal Commission).                         3   A decision in that case (Case No.  07 LA 46) is being issued simultaneously with this opinion.    The order of revocation is supported by the findings and the findings are supported by   substantial evidence in light of the whole record.       The revocation of the retail liquor license and all city licenses issued to Lucky 7 Foods,   Inc., Zafar Sheikh, President for the premises located at 4256 West Fullerton is sustained.       OPINION OF COMMISSIONER KOPPEL    The record in this case is quite clear.  The licensee has a history of selling liquor to   minor.  It is the responsibility of the License Appeal Commission to determine if the revocation   of the license was appropriate.  My colleague=s statement concerning the jurisdiction was proper.    This Commission is a creature of state statute that specifically states the authority it has on   appeals of revocation or suspension.  In this case, the order of revocation is supported by the   findings of fact which include the history of this license.   Based on its continuing history the   License Appeal Commission appropriately affirms the many violations of serving liquor to   minors.  The City is hereby  affirmed.                                          4   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED That the order revoking the liquor   license of the APPELLANT is AFFIRMED.    Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a petition for rehearing may be filed with this  commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order is  deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the  Circuit Court, the petition for rehearing must be filed with this commission within TWENTY (20) days  after service of this order as such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

The change from a steam  based system to an electrically operated facility will reduce carbon emissions by nearly 70  percent, increase reliability and save the City an estimated $4.5 million annually in  operating expenses.    “From closing coal plants, to updating streetlights, to converting our water pumping  stations, Chicago is showcasing to the world the impact that cities can have on climate  change for their residents and for people around the world,” said Mayor Emanuel. “Chicago  will continue to take ambitious steps towards creating a 21st century sustainable economy  that works towards reducing our carbon footprint.”     Mayor Emanuel recently announced that Chicago has reduced its carbon emissions by  eleven percent from 2005 to 2015, bringing the City forty percent of the way to meeting its  Paris Agreement goals. At the Springfield Station alone, the switch to electric power will  save 17,000 tons of carbon emissions every year. This equates to removing nearly 3,000  cars from the road or planting 400,000 trees annually.     “This station is responsible for distributing 45-60 million gallons of water daily to local  residents and businesses, making its reliability a top priority,” said Randy Conner,  Department of Water Management Commissioner. “This conversion is a great example of  how we can incorporate sustainable solutions while saving money and creating more  reliable infrastructure for our future.”          The Springfield Pumping Station conversion also focused on green infrastructure with the  installation of solar panels, permeable pavers, an underground retention basin and a green  roof. The station is expected to receive Silver LEED certification.    An additional 12,000 square feet of new park space for use by the community was created  through the demolition of unused City property and further enhances the environmental  benefits of the conversation.    Similar conversions are planned for three more pumping stations as part of the Mayor’s  Building a New Chicago infrastructure improvement plan.    Last week, Mayor Emanuel and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy  gathered municipal leaders from across the world to sign the Chicago Climate Charter, a  first-of-its-kind international charter on climate change at the North American Climate  Summit. Chicago is a national leader in acting locally and thinking globally in addressing  climate action.    The Mayor's June 7 Executive Order established the goal of reducing citywide greenhouse  gas emissions to levels equivalent to or greater 26-28 percent reduction from 2005 levels  to 2025, the original commitment made by the Obama Administration as part of the United  States’ commitment to the Paris Agreement. The reduction in greenhouse gases over the  past decade came while the number of jobs within the city increased by seven percent and  is equivalent to shutting down a coal power plant for fourteen months.    Mayor Emanuel has continued to drive additional carbon emission reductions through a  number of new initiatives or expansion of existing programs since 2015, ranging from  increasing the number of highly energy-efficient buildings, to updating all Chicago  streetlights to smart LEDs. Through these and other efforts, the City as well as its residents  and businesses save money, conserve resources, and reduce harmful pollution while also  creating clean 21st-century, local jobs.

By late October 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,192 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Morgan  Street, from W. 14th Place to W. 18th Street. The old water main dates back to 1871, and needs to be  replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  11th Ward Office: 773-254-6677  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635        Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.   Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

I want to be certain  you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you  have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 300 feet of 8-inch water main in W. 35th Street,  from S. Cottage Grove to 400’ to the east. The old main dates back to 1884 and  needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Burns’ office, and he has made clear we are to  put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas H. Powers, P.E.   Commissioner       cc: Alderman Will Burns        4th Ward                                                     Do you wonder what was happening in 1884? That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                 STATUE OF LIBERTY           Alaska became a U.S. territory.    The Ringling Brothers Circus premiered.    Grover Cleveland was elected President.    The first long distance telephone call was made.    The Statue of Liberty was presented to the U.S. in Paris.    The first known photograph of a tornado was taken near Howard, South Dakota.    Mark Twain wrote The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.                 PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 300 feet of 8-inch water main in  W. 35th Street, from S. Cottage Grove to 400’ to the east            Reason: The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1884, and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Work starts shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in late June. This includes  restoration. This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected developments in the  street, or other circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. 35th Street without interruption, but we will have to  restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   ALDERMAN WILL BURNS   773-536-8103   3-1-1         312-742-1029   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June. This  includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of  other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

We do not agree with his decision on the issue of whether the   order of a $3,000.00 fine is supported by the findings.          The Deputy Hearing Commissioner found that the City met its burden of proof on   Charges 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.  Her decision specifically stated that she felt that a $3,000.00   fine was, in part, an appropriate penalty in light of the present violations. (emphasis   added)  This statement suggests that it was the combined findings on six charges that   supported the $3,000.00.  Since all of the Commissioners have reversed findings on four   of these counts there are only findings in favor of the City on Counts 3 and 4.  Without   those other four findings there is no rationale for a $3,000.00 fine to be considered an   appropriate penalty.  The Deputy Hearing Commissioner could have indicated that the      1   fine was concurrent on all counts or could have broken the fine down to a set amount on   each finding of a violation but that was not done.  The language of the finding supporting   a $3,000.00 fine specifically refers to present violations.  With four of those findings   being reversed, the order of a $3,000.00 fine is not supported by the findings sustained by   all three Commissioners.          While we have reversed on this issue and need not address the question of   whether a $3,000.00 fine in this case would be so arbitrary and capricious as to justify   reversal in and itself, it is appropriate to point out certain problems in this record.  The   previous disciplinary history was allowed in evidence.  It shows a warning on January 20,   2006, for failure to notify the police and a $2,500.00 voluntary fine for a 100.100   violation.  There is nothing in the record that defined what a “100.100” violation was   and/or is.  It would be extremely difficult to determine the appropriateness of a fine   without knowing what conduct found the reason for the earlier fine.  Even with that   information it appears to us a $3,000.00 fine for failure to post an occupancy sign and   post a tavern license is very close to arbitrary and capricious since there is no question   that the licensee had valid licenses.          In order to avoid similar decisions in the future we respectfully request that   Deputy Hearing Commissioners specifically indicate if fines and/or suspensions and/or   revocations are entered concurrent on all findings or indicate the portion of the fine that   applies to each finding.          2      The order of a $3,000.00 fine is not supported by the findings.  The decision of   the Local Liquor Control Commission is reversed.       OPINION OF CHAIRMAN FLEMING IN DISSENT          The Licensee received notice that a hearing was to be held on October 12, 2007,   in connection with proceedings to revoke City of Chicago Retail Liquor License and all   other City of Chicago licenses issued to the licensee for the premises at 157 W. Ontario,   Chicago, Illinois.  The first two charges in the notice of hearing alleged incidents that   occurred on July 8, 2007.  Since no evidence was presented on those charges and they   were not sustained by the Deputy Hearing Commissioner this decision did not address   them.          The charges relevant to this decision are that on July 23, 2007, the licensee, by   and through its agent:                                                                          3.           4.             5.          Failed to conspicuously post illuminated, substantially secured,   signs indicating the number of persons who may legally occupy the  licensed premises at the main entrance to each room used as a   place of assembly in violation of Title 13, Chapter 84, Section 410,  Municipal Code of Chicago.    Conducted, engaged in, maintained, operated, carried on, or   managed a business or occupation for which a tavern license is   required without posting said license in a conspicuous place at the   premises where the business or occupation is being conducted, in   violation of Title 4, Chapter 4, Section 210 of the Municipal Code   of Chicago.    Conducted, engaged in, maintained, operated, carried on, or   managed a business or occupation for which a late hour license is   required without posting said license in a conspicuous place at the   premises where the business or occupation is being conducted, in    3                                                                            6.             7.             violation of Title 4, Chapter 4, Section 210 of the Municipal Code   of Chicago.    Conducted, engaged in, maintained, operated, or carried on or   managed a business or occupation for which a public place of   amusement license is required without posting said license in a   conspicuous place at the premises where the business or   occupation is being conducted, in violation of Title 4, Chapter 4,   Section 210 of the Municipal Code of Chicago.      Conducted, engaged in, maintained, operated, or carried on or   managed a business or occupation for which a tavern license is   required without posting said license in a conspicuous place at the   premises where the business or occupation is being conducted, in   violation of Title 4, Chapter 4, Section 210 of the Municipal Code   of Chicago.    After the case was continued on several occasions testimony from a City witness   was taken on April 3, 2009.  The matter was continued to May 15, 2009, and then to June   19, 2009, and finally to July 31, 2009, for additional City witnesses.  As no other officers   appeared the City rested its case on July 31, 2009, and the case was continued for the   defense to present its case on September 4, 2009.  On that date the matter was continued   until September 11, 2009.  The transcript of that date reflects Mr. Weber was not present   and further notes the Deputy Hearing Commissioner left a phone message continuing the   case until September 25, 2009, and at that hearing the City was allowed to introduce   City’s Exhibit 4 which is an Order of Prior Disposition.  The Deputy Hearing   Commissioner took the matter under advisement.  On October 2, 2009, Mr. Weber   presented a motion to vacate the September 25, 2009, order.  The motion was denied.  On   October 23, 2009, Mr. Weber presented a motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to   vacate.  The transcript reflects this motion was filed but does not reflect any ruling on the   motion.          4      The Hearing Commissioner entered findings of fact that the City met its burden of   proof on charges three through eight.  In light of the present violations and the prior   disciplinary history she found a $3,000.00 fine was an appropriate penalty.    Commissioner Norma Reyes adopted these findings as those of the Department of   Business Affairs and Consumer Protection/Local Liquor Control Commission.  The   licensee filed a timely appeal with this Commission.          Since this case involves an appeal of a fine review by this Commission is limited   to the questions:                                       a.     b.   c.     Whether the local liquor control commissioner has proceeded in   the manner provided by law;   Whether the order is supported by the findings;   Whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in light  of the whole record.   Counsel for the licensee has argued that the Local Liquor Control Commissioner   has  not proceeded in a manner provided by law in that the Hearing Commissioner’s   denial of his motion to vacate her order of September 25, 2009, taking the case under   advisement was an abuse of discretion that requires reversal by this Commission.  Mr.   Weber’s argument is that the Hearing Commissioner did not take into consideration the   facts set out in his motion and the harm to his client.  The transcript of the hearing of   October 2, 2009, shows Mr. Weber was allowed to set out his reasons that the previous   order should be vacated and that the Hearing Commissioner listened to those arguments   and denied the motion.  The fact that there was an adverse decision to Mr. Weber and his   client does not prove an abuse of discretion. A second point is that it is questionable if      5   this Commission has the authority to grant the relief sought.  This Commission does not   have the power to remand and can only reverse if the hearing did not proceed in a manner   provided by law.  That would suggest that the hearing itself was not conducted in a   manner prescribed by state statute or the Chicago Municipal Code.           The next issue is whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in   light of the whole record.  While this is a very broad standard and findings must be   affirmed if there is any evidence supporting the finding, findings must be reversed when   they are not supported by any evidence.          With respect to Counts 7 and 8 alleging failure to post a retail food license and   retail tobacco license respectively, there is no evidence in the record to support a finding   that food or tobacco were being sold.  The testimony from Sergeant Byrne was that he   saw no one eating food that night and did not observe any cigarettes or tobacco being   sold.  He could not recall any tobacco or cigarettes being held out for sale. Since there is   no evidence the licensee was conducting or engaged in the retail food or retail tobacco   business, there would be no need for such licenses to be posted.  The findings of the   Deputy Hearing Commissioner on these counts are reversed.          Count 5 alleged a failure to post a late hour liquor license.  Section 4-60-130 of   the Chicago Municipal Code sets forth the allowable hours of operation a retail of   alcoholic liquor may sell until 2:00 a.m. Mondays through Saturdays and until 3:00 a.m.   on Sunday mornings.          6      An essential element of proving the allegation in Count 5 would be establishing   that the date and time of the sale of alcohol required a late hour license.  Sergeant Byrne   testified he entered the premises at 2:15 a.m. but when asked about the day of the week   responded he could not remember specifically.  He added “there were a lot of people   there so that it was probably later in the week; Thursday, Friday, Saturday night.”    Counsel for the City did not attempt to refresh the Sergeant’s recollection as to the day of   the week.  Without evidence establishing the specific day of the week the City has failed   to prove that it was not on a Sunday morning.  If it was Sunday morning the licensee was   allowed to sell under 3:00 a.m.  The finding of Count 5 is reversed.          Count 6 alleges a failure to post a public place of amusement license.  In order to   affirm a finding that the violation occurred the record must have evidence that the   licensee engaged in a business or occupation that required a public place of amusement   license.  Section 4-156-300 requires a public place of amusement license if an owner,   lessee or manager produces, presents, or conducts, for gain or profit, any amusement.    There is no evidence in the record of any owner, manager or lessee presenting any   amusement for gain or profit.  While there was evidence that people were dancing and   music playing the record does not contain even an estimate from Sergeant Byrne as to the   capacity of the venue.  Section 4-156-305 (c) excepts from the public place of amusement   requirement “music, dancing, or other amusement, if: (1) it is offered in a venue with a   capacity of less than 100 persons and (11) no admission fee, minimum purchase   requirement, membership fee or other fee or charge is imposed for the privilege of   entering the premises or the portion of the premises where the music, dancing or other      7   amusement is provided or permitted.  The record is also devoid of any evidence that there   was an admission or cover charge.  The finding in favor of the City on  Count 6 is   reversed.          The City did meet its burden of proof on Counts 3 and 4 which alleged a failure to   post the occupancy sign and failure to post the tavern license.  The testimony of Sergeant   Byrne is sufficient to affirm the findings of the Deputy Hearing Commissioner on those   charges.          The final matter to be reviewed is whether the order of a $3,000.00 fine is   supported by the findings.  The specific question in this case is whether the $3,000.00   fine is supported by the two counts which have been affirmed?  Does the fact that the   findings in favor of the City on four of the counts have been reversed require that this   Commission find the $3,000.00 fine is not supported by the findings.          This Commission is placed in a compromising position.  Since it does not have   the power to remand the case to the Local for a review of the fine in light of the reversal   of the four counts it must either reverse outright or affirm the fine.  This Commission’s   decision would have been easier if the Deputy Hearing Commissioner had indicated in   her opinion that the $3,000.00 fine was concurrent on all findings.  Without that   indication this Commissioner must look at this fine in light of the fact that two charges   have been sustained and the fact that the licensee has a past history of a voluntary fine of   $2,500.00 and one voluntary warning.       8      Section 4-4-280 of the Chicago Municipal Code allows the Mayor to fine a   licensee if it is determined that the licensee has violated any of the provisions of the   Municipal Code or state statutes.  Since a fine is allowed for one violation of ordinance   and there were two sustained charges in this case the question is whether the $3,000.00   fine is so arbitrary and capricious that it should not be affirmed.  Since there was a   previous $2,500.00 fine for a single violation and another previous warning a $3,000.00   fine for findings on two counts is not so arbitrary and capricious that it must be reversed.    The fact that this Commissioner may not have arrived at that amount of a fine is not   relevant to this decision.          Counsel for licensee has provided citations to cases where reviewing courts have   remanded cases for reconsideration of sanctions when some, but not all, findings of   liability are reversed.  These cases are Dugan’s Bistro v. Daley 56 Ill App3d 463 and Sip   and Save Liquors, Inc. v. Daley 275 Ill App3d1009.  It is true that those cases deal with   similar fact situations to this case.  The difference is that this Commission does not have   the power to remand.  If that is the proper disposition for this case it must be ordered by   the Circuit Court.          This Commissioner affirms the decision of the Local Liquor Control Commission   based on the affirmance of Counts 3 and 4 in the Notice of Hearing.                                                     Dennis M. Fleming   Chairman         9      IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the order to Fine the      Appellant the sum of $3,000.00 is REVERSED.     Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a petition for rehearing may be filed  with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the  mailing of this order is deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an  administrative review action in the Circuit Court, the petition for rehearing must be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order as such petition is a  jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you, our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.      Our crews will soon install a new sewer in W. 68th Street, from S. Western Avenue to S. Bell  Avenue. The old sewer dates back to 1912 and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Thomas’ office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.               Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner         Cc: Alderman Latasha Thomas         17th Ward                          1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1       Do you wonder what was happening in 1912?  That’s the year the old sewer main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:            Prizes were included in Cracker Jack boxes for the first time.    The RMS Titanic made its first and last voyage.    Fenway Park in Boston opened.    Chicago Sun-Times columnist Irv Kupcinet, painter Jackson Pollock, and American chef   Julia Child were born.     LifeSavers candy made its debut.    Mail was carried by airplane for the first time.    A chemist named Kazimierz Funk coined the term “vitamins”.                                         PROJECT DESCRIPTION       Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon install a new sewer in W. 68th Street,  from S. Western Avenue to S. Bell Avenue.    Reason:  The old sewer main dates back to 1912 and needs replacement. The area bounded by  Marquette Road on the north, 69th Street on the south, Bell Avenue on the east and Western  Avenue on the west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work starts in October, and we expect the sewer replacement to be completed in  November. Restoration will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors.  If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:  We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.               CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN LATASHA THOMAS   773-723-0908             FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS           Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Thomas, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

But these references are also  denied to or at least indistinct for their audience. In the end, they leave us  not with knowledge, but with the self-understanding of our own boundar­ ies for the possibility of knowing. After that, all that is left is the darkness as  something that is, perhaps, aesthetically pleasurable, conceptually dystopic  yet compellingly challenging.   What becomes immediately clear upon viewing Girson’s paintings is their  insistence on the formal qualities of the work. Indeed, at first approach, one  is left with little but form. The paintings stand out from the wall insisting on  their status as objects, for example. But, of course, what is most unrelenting  is the darkness all around. No clear imagery is apparent but rather they ap­ pear like contemporary iterations of Modernist abstraction, stripes, blocks  and squares of color floating in space. They insist on their formal devices be­ cause it is initially quite difficult to make out any subject matter or content  beyond some awareness of the repetition of murky vertical lines of paint.  This formal opaqueness seems to suggest that, from a distance, we may be  able to compartmentalize the work as so much decorative, dark background  noise. And yet, conversely, they demand that we engage the work at a closer,  more  intense  level.  The  darkness  forces  us  to  look  for  the  light,  for  that  which is hidden. As though we are in a room with no light, the paintings ask  us to grope around slowly to determine their meanings in both aesthetic and  iconographic terms. In this regard, they are deeply absorptive.   This is particularly true of the largest paintings that seem to surround the  viewer in their scale. Fiction (2012), for example, draws you in and encom­ passes your body, much as traditional history painting used to do. Once up  close, the viewer is aware of the subtle and variable modulation of the dark  paint, which turns out not to be black but a veritable rainbow of blacks.  Your  concentration  is  rewarded  as  you  enter  this  environment  realizing,  first, the variations in color but then the different patterns of spaces and  books, of curtain and binding. Close looking favors an experience of visual  complexity.   Behind this lingers the specter of the philosopher Walter Benjamin’s well- known analysis of the auratic function of art.1  For Benjamin, works of art  like paintings insist on their aura because of their one-of-a-kind status, their  physicality, their inability to be replicated mechanically. Girson in this sense  is certainly a painter’s painter, working his surfaces to such a degree to give   Non-Fiction, 2013 Oil on Canvas, 60 x 80”   Gallery Talk  with Matthew Girson and Curator Greg Lunceford  Wednesday, June 4, 12:15pm   Panel Discussion  with Paul Jaskot, Lise McKean and Matthew Girson  Saturday, June 28, 1pm   Musical Performance  Saturday, August 2, 7pm  Coppice will perform compositions for live electronics and bellows in the galler  - ies exhibiting The Painter’s Other Library.

While private libraries have long stood for the intellectual  and social status of individuals—whether in ancient Rome or China, in the  monastery or the palace—the public library, accessible to all, has been wide­ spread as a phenomenon only in the modern world. Such an expansion of  the library’s function has also received a corresponding aesthetic expression.  For example, Henri Labrouste, the prominent 19th-century French architect,  gave his Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève (Paris, 1850) an impressive row of  iron columns in the interior to emphasize its break conceptually and aestheti­ cally with the masonry past, and he had sculpted representations of gas lights  on the façade to remind the public that it was accessible at night, i.e. as a  respite even for the worker after a long day, knowledge for all. By the 1893  World’s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago, no modern city was considered  complete without a grand edifice that proclaimed a city’s commitment to the  rational education of its citizenry. The result here was the dramatic and opti­ mistic public library that is now the Chicago Cultural Center.   Matthew Girson’s newest work, entitled “The Painter’s Other Library,” en­ gages the idealism embodied in this world of books with paintings that are  formally rich and deeply absorptive. Simultaneously, though, his approach to  the potential for knowledge’s critical function in the contemporary world is  just as thoroughly ambiguous. The tension between the possibilities of what  reason can achieve but also what devastation can be wrought by the most  advanced thought (Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer’s “dialectic of the  Enlightenment”) trouble Girson’s subjects and his aesthetic choices. He paints  a library that attracts, that insists on concentration and close looking. At the  same time, it is a library that resists knowledge, that obscures above all in  its resolute darkness. Girson thus thematizes the very limits of knowing in  the guise of pushing the status of representation to its extreme, focusing on  the  outer  edges  of  what  can  be  seen.  His  works  hinge  on  an  engagement  with multiple aesthetic and iconographic sources, from the darkest shadows   1    them the status of an icon and using the smallest variation of color that  makes them all but useless as reproductions. They exist only as objects of ab­ sorption. There is in addition a ritualistic quality both to their installation as  well as to the emphasis on the repetition of a series. One processes through  these paintings, stopping to move in to view a small work that rewards close  attention, or halting before the large-scale canvases to admire the effects on  the eye.   Benjamin is not a random philosophical reference, but rather points to that  which  conceptually  troubles  in  Girson’s  work.  Benjamin  wrote  his  essay,  “The Work of Art in the Age of its Mechanical Reproducibility,” in 1934,  at a moment when Hitler’s interest in aestheticized spectacles had become  all-too apparent. In his architectural projects from Munich to Berlin, Hitler  styled himself as the architect of a new Germany and a new world order; he  used aesthetic debates as a tool both to express his racialized world view and  to influence artistic practices. Further, the emphasis on his cult-like status  as leader was also aestheticized and rendered endlessly fascinating to a mass  German  audience,  most  famously  in  the  1935  film Triumph  of  the Will  (1935;  dir.  Leni  Riefenstahl).    It  was  this  “aestheticization  of  politics”  as  Benjamin called it that rendered Fascism so dangerous. It used film and art  to emphasize the aura, the cultic status of works and, simultaneously, the  seductive aspects of an authoritarian state. Benjamin critiqued this position  by counter-posing the materialist and seemingly rationalist function of art  under Communism (naturally, a position more difficult to maintain after  the exposure of the Stalinist purges of the late 1930s). For Benjamin, the  absorptive quality of an artwork contributed to its aura and thus to its abil­ ity to seduce.   Girson is more than aware of this history, as indeed he references the Nazi  past and its cultural expression both directly and indirectly. The fire series,  for example, derives its basic form from a short segment from Reifenstahl’s  film. More indirectly and broadly, in previous work (such as his Scotoma  series) Girson has dealt with the troubling intersection of intellectual knowl­ edge and blindness often assigned to the core dynamic of the Nazi state; after  all, the same scientific breakthroughs that produced Albert Einstein and the  same culture that fostered Thomas Mann would also result in the barbarity  of the Nazi genocide.2   In addition, early on as he was thinking about this   Allegory, Allegory, Part 1 (3 of 24 panels), 2014, Oil on Aluminum, each panel 8 x 16”   series, Girson visited the site not only of the Party Rally Grounds in Nurem­ burg where Riefenstahl filmed but also the Party library in Munich (now  the Central Institute of Art History). The latter site was a location where, in  the Nazi period, knowledge was used for its most destructive possibilities,  while today it has been turned here to the seemingly humanist study of art.  In these dark paintings, he thus toys with the tension between a form that  conjures up the gloss, fascination and ambition of the grand tradition of  painting and, at the same time, an obscured content that signals the most  grotesque function that human cultural goals have justified. The genocide  depended on the racist idealism at the heart of Hitler’s cultural and political  ambitions. This is the endgame of modernity.   The general question of the status of art and knowledge that Girson’s work  poses is at least on the surface at times too uncomfortably engaged with the  Nazi past and the seductive interest it continues to raise in the general pub­ lic and mass culture. Susan Sontag discussed this allure in her foundational  essay “Fascinating Fascism” which dealt with the fetishistic, aesthetic power  of Nazi culture in postwar society and how our aesthetic return to Riefens­ tahl and other sources masked or even makes beautiful the political brutal­ ity of the regime.3  For Sontag writing in 1974, the uncritical appropriation  of Fascist aesthetics blunted the possibility of a productive and necessary  ideological critique of past and present reactionary politics. Such a critical  position, however, became more confused with the explosion of artists like  Anselm Kiefer who in the 1970s and 1980s directly thematized perpetrators  and violence in his paintings or with the more deeply ironic responses to  Nazi crimes of a younger generation of artists more recently as in the 2003    exhibition “Mirroring Evil”.4   In the stream of this tradition, there is no denying that Girson’s paintings  refuse to take a clear critical stance towards the past. Girson has little faith  in a mantra of ideology critique, and indeed no faith in rationality alone,   per se. For this reason, his books are inaccessible, his sources obscure and  varied, his points of reference ambiguous. Simultaneously, the deep look­ ing required of the viewer and the play between rich matte surfaces draws  us in to the auratic and fascinating qualities of the paintings. It is on this  level that Girson can push us too close to an insistence on pleasure at the  expense of knowledge. (Could there be a more transparent politics here?)  At the same time, though, he saves himself from that seemingly uncritical  ledge through the incessant repetition of forms and motifs, clearly reflect­ ing a traumatic inability to escape the very past or concept of modernity  with which we are fascinated. And after all, however pleasant the experi­ ence may be, it is also one that is constantly frustrated and obscured in the  dark and dreary inkiness of those variably black surfaces. We are encour­ aged and rejected simultaneously.    These paintings thus intrigue but challenge our fascination with the sup­ posed progress of modernity. Yet, Girson also does not allow for any easy  postmodern posture that assumes ironic detachment. It is to work through  and thematize this contradiction that he has, on the one hand, surrounded  us with books of all shapes, sizes and colors, showing us the wealth of  knowledge that art provides, while, on the other, he has made the books  and indeed the library unusable, filled with a darkness that barely allows us  to distinguish the object of the volume let alone read it. This is knowledge  that is right there for us, drawing us in, and at the same time stubbornly  obscure.   The great challenge that the Nazi regime posed to the concep­ tion of modernity as the rational trust in knowledge lingers like a scrim  over these already difficult images.      Girson’s work toggles back and forth between that potential for manipu­ lation  and  dominance  but  also  the  possibility  for  knowledge  and  even  progress. Thus, fascinating and absorptive as these images may be, there is  also his insistence on a critical experience of frustration. That frustration   reminds us of the limits of knowledge but also of our interest in pushing  against such limits. Representation offers a moment for clarity at the same  time that it is a site of enigma. In many ways, the enigmatic qualities of the  work teach us more about ourselves.  Matthew Girson wants to draw you  in close to think about the possibilities of the visual. In the end, these are  complicated works that do not resolve, or rather that resist resolution. The  closer we look, the better we see, but the further we are from the truths em­ bodied in these books of knowledge. We are in a dark library. What such a  site implies for both our enlightenment as well as our downfall becomes the  real core of his paintings and his conceptual concerns.   Paul B.

Influenza activity  has not peaked in Chicago; it is not too late to get a flu shot.   Vaccination is the best way to protect against influenza infection and all Chicagoans aged six months and older are  encouraged to get vaccinated.  Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine  availability.  For those without a healthcare provider or whose healthcare providers do not have the influenza  vaccine, a schedule of City of Chicago influenza vaccination clinics2 is available on the City website and by calling  311.  To locate the closest City of Chicago clinic or retail pharmacy, go to www.chicagoflushots.org.                                 What is the risk?   Currently, the risk of influenza infection is low.                                                                                                                                Figure 1.

Data on influenza virus test results are reported by  Chicago laboratories performing influenza RT-PCR.  For the week of November 12-18, 2017, with 5  laboratories reporting, 4 of the 548 (<1%) specimens  tested for influenza were positive (1 A (H3N2) and 3  unknown subtype) (Figure 2).     Since October 1, 2017, 24 of 3,677 (<1%) specimens  tested for influenza have been positive; 21 typed as  influenza A (16 H3N2, 5 unknown subtype [subtyping  not performed or not all subtypes tested]) and three  typed as influenza B.

How much influenza-like illness is occurring?                                                                                        CDPH receives data from several hospitals in  Chicago that provide emergent care, which report  on a weekly basis the total number of emergency  department visits, and of those visits, the number  with influenza-like illness (fever of 100°F or greater  and cough and/or sore throat).  Influenza-like  illness is not lab-confirmed influenza, but is used to  monitor emergency department and doctor’s office  visits for people with flu-like symptoms.    For the week of November 12-18, 2017, with seven  hospitals reporting, 2.4% of emergency department  visits were due to ILI (Figure 3).     In addition to emergency departments, several  outpatient clinics throughout Chicago participate in  CDC’s Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) by also reporting on a weekly basis the total number of  outpatient clinic visits, and of those visits, the number with influenza-like illness (ILI).     For the week of November 12-18, 2017, with 22 facilities reporting, 2.7% of outpatient clinic visits were due to  influenza-like illness (Figure 4).     1https://www.chicagohan.org/ViewsFlash/servlet/viewsflash?cmd=showform&pollid=IMMZ!IMMZVoucher2017; 2https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/ supp_info/health-protection/2017-influenza-walk-in-clinic-schedule.html   Page  1 of 2  All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.       ESSENCE is an electronic syndromic surveillance system  used to monitor influenza-like illness by utilizing the chief  complaints of patients visiting emergency departments.   Currently, all Chicago hospitals submit data to  ESSENCE on a daily basis, covering every emergency  department visit in the city.    Figure 3. Percent of emergency department visits attributed to  influenza-like illness based on manual reports by individual  hospitals, Chicago, by week, for the current season (2017-2018)  and previous three seasons, October-May.   For the week of November 12-18, 2017, 477 of the  23,805 (2%) emergency department visits among the  59 Chicago zip codes analyzed were due to influenza- like illness (ILI).  Among age groups, children under  five years of age had the highest percentage of visits  due to influenza-like illness at 9.0%, followed by those  5-17 years of age at 3.2%; those 18-44, 45-64, and 65  and older were at 1% or less.     Figure 5 represents the percentage of emergency  department visits due to influenza-like illness  aggregated by patient zip code.  For the week of  November 12-18, 2017, 40 of 59 (68%) zip codes had  ILI activity levels in the minimal to low categories and 19  (32%) had ILI activity levels in the moderate to high  categories; the median percent ILI was 1.6% with a  range from <1% to 6.2% (Figure 6).

Indicator Description   This indicator looks at the incidence of Lyme disease in the United States since 1991. Lyme disease is a  tick-borne bacterial illness that can cause fever, fatigue, and joint and nervous system complications.  The spread of Lyme disease is affected by tick prevalence; populations and infection rates among host  species; human population patterns, awareness, and behavior; habitat; climate; and other factors. Lyme  disease may be useful for understanding the long-term effects of climate change on vector-borne  diseases because shorter-term variations in weather have less of an impact on ticks than on other  disease vectors such as mosquitoes. This is the case for several reasons (Ogden et al., 2013):     •  Ticks have a relatively long life cycle, including stages of development that take place in the soil,   where temperatures fluctuate less than air temperatures.   •  Tick development rates have a delayed response to temperature changes, which minimizes the   effects of short-term temperature fluctuations.   •  Ticks can take refuge in the soil during periods of extreme heat, cold, drought, or rainfall.  •  Ticks are associated with woodland habitats, where microclimates are buffered from   temperature extremes that occur in treeless areas.   •  Unlike other disease vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks do not have nonparasitic immature   feeding stages whose survival is susceptible to short-term changes in weather.     Consequently, in some locations in the United States, Lyme disease incidence would be expected to  increase with climate change.    Components of this indicator include:     •  Annual incidence of Lyme disease in the United States (Figure 1).  •  Change in reported Lyme disease incidence in the Northeast and Upper Midwest (Figure 2).  •  Change in incidence and distribution of reported cases of Lyme disease in the Northeast and   Upper Midwest (1996 and 2014 maps).     2.  Revision History   Indicator published.  Updated indicator on EPA’s website with data through 2013.   May 2014:   June 2015:  August 2016:  Updated indicator with data through 2014.     Technical Documentation: Lyme Disease   1   Data Sources   3.  Data Sources   This indicator is based on annual numbers of confirmed Lyme disease cases, nationally and by state,  compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Division of Vector-Borne Diseases  (DVBD). Incidence was calculated using the most recent mid-year population estimates for each year  from the U.S. Census Bureau. The 1996 and 2014 comparison maps also came from CDC.    4.  Data Availability   All of the data for this indicator are publicly available on CDC and Census Bureau websites.    EPA obtained the data for this indicator from CDC’s website. Prior to 2008, CDC compiled only confirmed  cases, but in 2008 it also began to track probable (but unconfirmed) cases. CDC’s database allows users  to query just the confirmed cases, which EPA used for this indicator.    Although data are available for 1990, this indicator starts in 1991 because Lyme disease did not become  an official nationally reportable disease until January 1991. In 1990, some states reported Lyme disease  incidence using the standardized case definition that went into effect nationwide in 1991, but other  states did not.    CDC’s national and state-level data are available online. Through the years, these data have been  published in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR), which are available at:  www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_nd/index.html. Data from 2003 onward are also available in tabular form  at: www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/mmwr.html. Underlying county-level data are not available publicly—or  they are combined into multi-year averages before being made publicly available—because of concerns  about patient confidentiality. Annual maps of reported cases of Lyme disease, as shown in the  1996/2014 comparison for this indicator, are posted online at: www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/index.html.    Following CDC’s standard practice, incidence has been calculated using population estimates on July 1 of  each calendar year. These population estimates are publicly available from the U.S. Census Bureau’s  Population Estimates Program. Pre-2010 data are available at:  www.census.gov/popest/data/intercensal/index.html. Data for 2010 and later are available at:  www.census.gov/popest/data/index.html.    Methodology   5.  Data Collection   This indicator is based on the annual reported number of Lyme disease cases as compiled by CDC.     State and local health departments report weekly case counts for Lyme disease following CDC’s case  definitions through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). The NNDSS is a public- health system for the reporting of individual cases of disease and conditions to state, local, and  territorial health departments, which then forward case information to CDC. The provisional state-level   Technical Documentation: Lyme Disease   2   data are reported in CDC’s MMWR. After all states have verified their data, CDC publishes an annual  surveillance summary for Lyme disease and other notifiable diseases.     Health care providers nationwide follow a standardized definition for what constitutes a “confirmed”  case of Lyme disease, but this definition has changed over time (see Section 8). The first standardized  surveillance case definition was established in 1990 by the Council of State and Territorial  Epidemiologists (CSTE). In January 1991, Lyme disease became a nationally notifiable disease in the  United States, using the CSTE’s 1990 definition. As such, state and local health departments work with  health care providers to obtain case reports for Lyme disease based upon the CSTE case definition.    6.   Indicator Derivation   Figure 1. Reported Cases of Lyme Disease in the United States, 1991–2014    National incidence of Lyme disease was calculated using the total number of confirmed Lyme disease  cases and the national population for each year from 1991 through 2014. EPA calculated incidence by  dividing the number of confirmed cases per year by the corresponding population on July 1 in the same  calendar year. EPA then multiplied the per-person rate by 100,000 to generate a normalized incidence  rate per 100,000 people. This is CDC’s standard method of expressing the incidence of Lyme disease.    Figure 2. Change in Reported Lyme Disease Incidence in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, 1991–2014    EPA used ordinary least-squares linear regression to determine the slope of the trend over time for each  state. Of the 50 states plus the District of Columbia, 36 have a long-term linear trend in Lyme disease  incidence that is statistically significant to a 95-percent level, and 31 have trends that are significant to a  99-percent level. Many of these trends, however, have a very small slope. Taking the regression slope  (the annual rate of change) and multiplying it by 23 years (the length of the period of record) to  estimate total change, more than half of the states had a total change of less than 1 case per 100,000 in  either direction.     In this analysis, 14 states stand out because they have Lyme disease rates more than 10 times higher  than most of the other states, average rates of more than 10 cases per 100,000 per year during the most  recent five years of data, and in all but three of these states, statistically significant total increases of 10  to 100 cases per 100,000 between 1991 and 2014. These 14 states are:     •  Connecticut  •  Delaware  •  Maine  •  Maryland  •  Massachusetts  •  Minnesota  •  New Hampshire  •  New Jersey  •  New York  •  Pennsylvania  •  Rhode Island  •  Vermont    Technical Documentation: Lyme Disease   3   •  Virginia  •  Wisconsin     Together, these 14 states account for about 95 percent of the nation’s reported cases of Lyme disease in  2014, as the map in Figure TD-1 indicates.       Figure TD-1. Reported Cases of Lyme Disease in the United States, 2014   Data source: CDC: www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/maps.html. Accessed December 2015.      Figure 2 shows the total change (annual rate of change [regression slope] multiplied by 23 years) for the  14 states listed above. Trends are not shown for Connecticut, New York, and Rhode Island in Figure 2  because of too much year-to-year variation in reporting practices to allow trend calculation (see Section  12).    Reported Lyme Disease Cases in 1996 and 2014     This comparison uses two maps—one for the year 1996 and one for the year 2014—to illustrate changes  in the incidence and distribution of reported cases of Lyme disease in the United States over time. CDC  created these maps. Each dot on the maps represents an individual case placed randomly within the  patient’s county of residence, which may differ from the county of exposure.     Indicator Development    In the course of developing and revising this indicator based on peer review and comments from CDC  experts, EPA considered several ways to present the data. For example:     Technical Documentation: Lyme Disease   4   •  The incidence of a disease can be tracked with total case counts or with incidence rates that are   normalized by population size. EPA chose to display rates for this indicator so as to eliminate  state-to-state population differences and changes in population over time as confounding  factors. This approach is also consistent with data for EPA’s Heat-Related Deaths indicator,  which is displayed using incidence rates.   •  EPA considered focusing the analysis of reported Lyme disease on a subset of states. One   approach was to consider “reference states” as defined by CDC  (www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss5710.pdf). Upon clarification from CDC, however, this set of  reference states has not been used operationally since CDC’s Healthy People 2010 effort, which  concluded in 2010, and they do not necessarily represent a consistent baseline from which to  track trends. EPA chose to use more objective, data-driven thresholds for selecting states to  show readers all change in reported Lyme disease incidence as in Figure 2. However, there is  scientific evidence (e.g., Diuk-Wasser et al., 2012; Stromdahl and Hickling, 2012) that notes the  geographic differences in Ixodes scapularis (the deer tick or blacklegged tick) in North America— and that increases in Lyme disease cases in many states south of 35°N latitude are likely due to  non-climate-related expansion of northern I. scapularis tick genotypes. Analyzing data for a set  of states in the northern part of the range of I. scapularis might lead to better understanding of  changes in Lyme disease cases as related to a warming climate. Thus, future work on this  indicator will attempt to reflect the effects of climate change on expansion in the range of I.  scapularis, increasing abundance of I. scapularis where it already occurs, increases in the  prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi (the bacteria that actually cause Lyme disease) in host- seeking ticks, and/or updated understanding of other known environmental drivers, such as  deer density and changes in landscape, habitat, and biodiversity.   •  EPA considered mapping rates or trends by county; however, county-level case totals are only  publicly available from CDC in five-year bins, in part because of the very low number of cases  reported in many counties.           7.  Quality Assurance and Quality Control   Each state has established laws mandating that health providers report cases of various diseases  (including Lyme disease) to their health departments. Each state health department verifies its data  before sharing them with CDC. The NNDSS is the primary system by which health surveillance data are  conveyed to CDC for national-level analyses.     Starting in 1990, CDC launched the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance  (NETSS), replacing mail and phone-based reporting. In 2000, CDC developed the National Electronic  Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) Base System (NBS). This central reporting system sets data and  information technology standards for departments that provide data to CDC, ensuring that data are  submitted quickly, securely, and in a consistent format.     Using CSTE case definitions, CDC provides state and local health departments and health providers with  comprehensive guidance on laboratory diagnosis and case classification criteria, ensuring that all health  providers and departments classify Lyme disease cases consistently throughout the United States.    State health officials use various methods to ascertain cases, including passive surveillance initiated by  health care providers, laboratory-based surveillance, and “enhanced or active surveillance” (Bacon et al.,   Technical Documentation: Lyme Disease   5   2008). State officials check the data and remove duplicate reports before submitting annual totals to  CDC.    CDC has undertaken a review of alternative data sources to see how closely they align with the disease  counts captured by the NNDSS. These alternative sources include medical claims information from a  large insurance database, a survey of clinical laboratories, and a survey that asks individuals whether  they have been diagnosed with Lyme disease in the previous year. Preliminary results from this review  suggest that the NNDSS may be undercounting the true number of cases of Lyme disease (CDC, 2013).  See Section 10 for further discussion about this possible source of uncertainty.    Analysis   8.  Comparability Over Time and Space   Lyme disease data collection follows CDC’s case definition to ensure consistency and comparability  across the country. The national case definition for Lyme disease has changed twice since Lyme disease  became a notifiable disease, however: first in 1996 and again in 2008. Prior to 1996, a confirmed case of  Lyme disease required only a skin lesion with the characteristic “bulls-eye” appearance. In 1996, CDC  expanded the definition of confirmed cases to include laboratory-confirmed, late-manifestation  symptoms such as issues with the musculoskeletal, nervous, and cardiovascular systems. In 2008, the  case classifications were expanded again to include suspected and probable cases.     These definition changes necessitate careful comparisons of data from multiple years. While it is not  possible to control for the case definition change in 1996, CDC provides the numbers of confirmed cases  and suspected and probable cases separately. The granularity of the data enables EPA to use confirmed  cases in the incidence rate calculation for all years and exclude the probable cases that have been  counted since 2008, ensuring comparability over time.    In addition to the national changes, several state reporting agencies have changed their own definitions  at various times. These state-level changes include California in 2005, Connecticut in 2003, the District of  Columbia in 2011, Hawaii in 2006, New York in 2007, and Rhode Island in 2004. The extent to which  these changes affect overall trends is unknown, but it is worth noting that Connecticut and Rhode Island  both have apparent discontinuities in their annual totals around the time of their respective definitional  changes, and these two states and New York all have statistically insignificant long-term trends (see  Section 12), despite being surrounded by states with statistically significant increases. Because of these  state-level uncertainties, Figure 2 shows only state-level trends that are statistically significant. In this  case, the p-value for each displayed state is less than 0.01.    9.  Data Limitations   Factors that may have an impact on the confidence, application, or conclusions drawn from this  indicator are as follows:     1.  For consistency, this indicator includes data for only confirmed cases of Lyme disease. However,   changes in diagnosing practices and awareness of the disease over time can affect trends.    Technical Documentation: Lyme Disease   6   2.  CDC’s national Lyme disease case definitions have changed twice since Lyme disease became a  notifiable disease. As discussed in Section 8, it is not possible to control for the case definition  change in 1996, which adds some uncertainty to the indicator. State agencies have also changed  their definitions at various times, as described in Section 8.   3.  As described in Section 10, public health experts believe that many cases of Lyme disease are   not reported, which means this indicator underestimates the true incidence of the disease (CDC,  2013). The reporting rate may vary over time and space as a result of differences in funding and  emphasis among state surveillance programs. In addition, Lyme disease can be difficult to  diagnose. Cases in locations where Lyme disease is not endemic are at particular risk of being  unidentified or misdiagnosed.   4.  As an indicator of climate change, Lyme disease is limited due to several confounding factors:               •  Pest extermination efforts and public health education may counteract the growth of   confirmed cases expected due to warming climates.   •   Importantly, there are several factors driving changes in incidence of Lyme disease other  than climate. Several of these factors have not been well-quantified or studied. Possible  factors include range expansion of vector ticks, which is not always climate-related;  proximity of hosts; changes in deer density; changes in biodiversity; and the effects of  landscape changes such as suburbanization, deforestation, and reforestation.    •  Pathogen transmission is affected by several factors including geographic distribution,   population density, prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens, and the pathogen load  within individual hosts and vectors (e.g., Cortinas and Kitron, 2006; Lingren, 2005; Mills et  al., 2010; Raizman, 2013).   •  Human exposure depends upon socioeconomic and cultural factors, land use, health care   access, and living conditions (Gage et al., 2008; Gubler et al., 2001; Hess et al., 2012;  Lafferty, 2009; Wilson, 2009).   5.  Lyme disease surveillance data capture the county of residence, which is not necessarily the   location where an individual was infected.   10.  Sources of Uncertainty   The main source of uncertainty for this indicator stems from its dependence on surveillance data.  Surveillance data can be subject to underreporting and misclassification. Because Lyme disease is often  determined based upon clinical symptoms, lack of symptoms or delayed symptoms may result in  overlooked or misclassified cases. Furthermore, surveillance capabilities can vary from state to state, or  even from year to year based upon budgeting and personnel.    Although Lyme disease cases are supposed to be reported to the NNDSS, reporting is actually voluntary.  As a result, surveillance data for Lyme disease do not provide a comprehensive determination of the  U.S. population with Lyme disease. For example, it has been reported that the annual total number of  people diagnosed with Lyme disease may be as much as 10 times higher than the surveillance data   Technical Documentation: Lyme Disease   7   indicate (CDC, 2013). Consequently, this indicator provides an illustration of trends over time, not a  measure of the exact number of Lyme disease cases in the United States.    Another issue is that surveillance data are captured by county of residence rather than county of  exposure. Reports of Lyme disease may therefore occur in states with no active pathogen populations.  For example, a tourist may be infected with Lyme disease while visiting Connecticut (an area with high  incidence of Lyme disease) but not be identified as a Lyme disease case until the tourist returns home to  Florida (an area where blacklegged ticks cannot survive). This may result in underreporting in areas of  high Lyme disease incidence and overreporting in areas of low Lyme disease incidence.    For a discussion of the uncertainties associated with the U.S. Census Bureau’s intercensal estimates, see:  www.census.gov/popest/methodology/intercensal_nat_meth.pdf.     11.  Sources of Variability    The incidence of Lyme disease is likely to display variability over time and space due to:     •  Changes in populations of blacklegged ticks and host species (e.g., deer, mice, birds) over time.  •  Spatial distribution of blacklegged ticks and changes in their distribution over time.  •  The influence of climate on the activity and seasonality of the blacklegged tick.  •  Variability in human population over time and space.       This indicator accounts for these factors by presenting a broad multi-decadal national trend in Figures 1  and 2. EPA has reviewed the statistical significance of these trends (see Section 12).    12.  Statistical/Trend Analysis   Based on ordinary least-squares linear regression, the national incidence rate in Figure 1 increases at an  average annual rate of +0.22 cases per 100,000 people (p < 0.001).     Of the 14 states shaded in Figure 2, 11 had statistically significant increases in their annual incidence  rates from 1991 to 2014 (all p-values substantially less than 0.01), based on ordinary least-squares linear  regression. The shading in Figure 2 shows the magnitude of these trends. The other three states did not:  Connecticut (p = 0.74), New York (p = 0.11), and Rhode Island (p = 0.23). A broader analysis described in  Section 6 found that more than half of the 50 states had significant trends in their annual incidence rates  from 1991 to 2014, but most of these states were excluded from Figure 2 because their overall  incidence rates have consistently been at least an order of magnitude lower than the rates in the 14 key  Northeast and Upper Midwest states where Lyme disease is most prevalent.

SECURE all openings to prevent unlawful entry.     Openings with secure doors and windows, without broken or cracked glass, may   be left as-is so long as they remain secure and in good condition.     Openings may be boarded with plywood or secured by other reasonable means.    At least one exit must be maintained (more for larger buildings).   If a property has repeated break-ins, additional measures may be required.      2.  REGISTER the vacant building on the Department of Buildings web site. (see below)     A registration fee ($500) is required at the time of initial registration.    The registration must be renewed every 6 months for as long as the building  remains vacant, and material changes in the registration information must be  reported through the website within 20 days.  There is no fee for renewal.  3.    POST signs on the building, visible and legible from the nearest street and alley.     The signs must include the name, address, and phone number of the registered  mortgagee (or mortgagee’s agent) and the vacant building registration number.  4.  MAINTAIN the property and inspect regularly to verify the exterior is clean and secure.     Keep the lot clean. Maintain fences and gates. Cut the grass, remove weeds,   garbage, debris, dead trees and fallen limbs. In winter, shovel any accumulated  snow to allow public use of the adjacent sidewalk and keep the property free  from pests such as rats and other rodents.     Winterize the building’s heating and plumbing systems.    Maintain the exterior of the building (walls, windows, doors and roof) and stairs   and steps leading to the main entrance.   These requirements are subject to certain limitations and defenses.  Consult the Municipal Code  of Chicago for complete details.  Failure to comply with these requirements may result in serious  penalties.  Registration of a vacant building will not prevent the City of Chicago from seeking  authority to demolish or secure a vacant building as authorized by law  A property must be deregistered if the loan is transferred or released or if the building is  reoccupied, sold, or demolished. A new owner registration must be created by any person  who takes title to a vacant building following a judicial sale or other foreclosure-related transfer,  including REO, within 30 days of taking ownership.
