To make sure your helmet fits right, put it on and then use the “eyes/ears/mouth” test. Eyes: When you look up you should see the front rim. If not, your helmet won’t protect your forehead. Ears: The side straps should come to a “V” just below each ear. Mouth: When  you  open  your  mouth  wide,  you should feel the helmet push down on your head. If your  helmet  doesn't  pass  the  test,  adjust  the straps or add bigger pads to get the right fit. Ventilation- Good  air  flow  comes  from long, wide vents that channel air through the helmet to keep you cool.   Cost- You can spend well over $100 for the  latest  space  age  helmet,  but  a  good safety-rated helmet goes for around $30.  Replace your helmet if it becomes dam- aged in an accident. Also replace a helmet every two  years.  The  foam  inside  becomes  hard  and stale and will not absorb shock as well as it should.  yes  no  6  STUDENT CYCLING IN CHICAGO w w w .

Daley  Mayor  Steven J. Lux  City Comptroller  March 14, 2008  BENEFITS BULLETIN  IT’S TIME FOR SPRING SCHOOL TERM   PROOF OF STUDENT STATUS  If your continuous service date shows you were hired on or after August  1,  1984,  and  if  you  are  not  a  sworn  police  officer  or  a  uniformed  firefighter,  medical  benefits  for your eligible dependent(s) will terminate at midnight prior to their 19th birthday.  Medical benefits can be extended until their 22nd birthday, if you submit satisfactory “proof of student status” in both the Spring and Fall each year (within required time frame) confirming  that  your  eligible  dependent(s)  are  full-time students at an accredited college or university.  Important  Note: The  student’s  school  determines  the  definition of full-time.  Dental  benefits  will  terminate  for  your  eligible  dependent(s) at midnight prior to their 19th birthday whether they are full-time students or not.   Call  the  Health  Care  Services  Corporation (HCSC)  at  1-888-541-7107  to find  out  more  about continuation  of  dental  and/or  medical  coverage through the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) program.  If you are a sworn police officer or a uniformed firefighter, or  if  your  continuous  service  date  shows  you  were  hired before August  1,  1984,  proof  of  student  status  is  not required for your eligible dependents.  For  complete  details  about  dependent  age  limits  for medical  and  dental  benefits, please  visit  the  “general information”  section  of  the  Benefits  Management Division  website  www.cityofchicago.org/benefits and click on the words: Frequently Asked Questions.  Important Reminder: The deadline for the current Spring school term proof of  student status for continuation of medical benefits is Monday, March 31, 2008. The following two documents must be submitted to the Benefits Management Division  twice a year or your eligible dependent(s) will not have medical benefits through the  City of Chicago for the full calendar year:  1) Original letter dated after 2/1/08 from the school’s Registrar’s Office confirming  full-time student status for the current school term.  2) Copy of full or partially paid tuition bill or grants for the current school term.  (SEE REVERSE SIDE)  3/08  UNDERSTANDING PROOF OF STUDENT STATUS GUIDELINES  • The letter from the school’s Registrar’s Office is often issued on the school’s  multicolored letterhead or has a raised seal. It cannot be a photocopy or a facsimile (fax). It cannot be dated prior to February. 1, 2008 for the current Spring school term. It must state the student is enrolled on a “full-time” basis.  • The student’s name must appear on the copy of full or partially paid tuition bill or  grants for the current school term.  Various forms of proof of payment are acceptable including a copy of the student’s grant letter or student account printed from the Internet. The bill must be at least partially paid.  UNDERSTANDING FAMILY STATUS CHANGE GUIDELINES  If you wish to add or drop an eligible dependent from your coverage, you must wait until the annual open enrollment period unless you experience a qualifying Family Status Change during the year:  Examples of family status changes  include the following:  Here are some examples of changes NOT considered family status changes:  • your marriage or divorce • your enrollment or termination of an eligible  domestic partner  • birth or adoption of a child • death of a spouse or covered dependent • a covered dependent reaching the   limiting age, or   • a change in employment status for you   or your spouse  You must submit an enrollment form to the Benefits Management Division to add/delete within 30 days  of family status changes. You must also submit acceptable documentation to support the change in coverage within 60 days of your request.  1) You get married but you don’t notify the  Benefits Management Division for six months. Since you didn’t request coverage for the spouse within 30 days of your marriage, you will have to wait until the next open enrollment period to add your new spouse.  2) You decide that you no longer want coverage  for your children. Since this is not a family status change, you’ll have to wait until the next open enrollment period to drop coverage for your children.  IMPORTANT REMINDER IF YOU DIVORCE YOUR SPOUSE:  You Must Drop All Ineligible Dependents Including Divorced Spouses Or   You Will Be Billed The Cost Of Coverage And/Or Risk Financial Consequences.  3/08

In late September 2017, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 322  feet of new 8-inch water main in S Hoyne Ave from W Washburne Ave to W 13th St, 647 feet of new  8-inch  water  main  in  W  13th  St  from  S  Damen  Ave  to  S  Wolcott  Ave  and  360  feet  of  new  8-inch  water main in S Wolcott Ave from W Washburne Ave to W 13th St.  The old water main dates back to  1896, and needs to be replaced.     If  you  would  like  to  receive  regular  email  updates  about  the  progress  of  the  project,  please  go  to  BuildingANewChicago.org  to  register  for  the  WaterALERT  program.    Simply  enter  your  name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By  signing  up  for  the  WaterALERT  emails,  you  will  be  notified  as  the  project  enters  each  new  construction  phase  –  from  our mobilization of  equipment  onto  the site,  to  the  installation of  new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We  know  that  construction  always  involves  inconveniences  and  noise.  We  will  do  everything  possible  to  maintain  your  quality  of  life  throughout  these  projects,  and  conducting  ourselves  as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    28th Ward Office:  773- 533-0900    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose  spigot,  laundry  sink  faucet  or  bathtub)  to  where  the  water  comes  into  the  home  that  is  not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap  and  let  the  water  run  for  at  least  5  minutes.   Next  flush  any  other  cold  water  faucets  on  that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call  311.    For  additional  advice  and  information  visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank  you  in  advance  for  your  patience  and  cooperation  during  this  important  infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner   Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

Top Notch Beetburger Shop  Respondents.    TO:  Matthew P. Weems  Law Office of Matthew P.  Weems  180 N.  Stetson St., Suite 3500  Chicago, IL 60610   Case No.:  09-P-31    Date of Ruling:  June 15, 2011   Date Mailed:  June 23, 2011    Diran Soul ian, President  Top Notch Beefburger, Inc.  2116 W. 95""' St.  Chicago,  IL 60643   FINAL ORDER ON ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS   YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED  that on June  15,  2011,  the Chicago Commission  on  Human Relations  issued a Final Ruling on  Attorney Fees and Costs in  favor of Complainant in  the above-captioned matter.  The Commission orders Respondent to  pay attorney fees  of $2,400 and costs of $22.03, for a total award  of $2422.03.  The findings and specific terms of the  ruling are enclosed. Respondent is ordered to  pay the  total amount to Complainant's attorney at the address stated above.   Pursuant to  Commission  Regulations  100(15)  and  250.150,  a  party  may  obtain  review  of this  order  by  filing  a  petition  for  a common  law  writ  of certiorari with  the  Chancery  Division of the Circuit Court  of  Cook County  according  to  applicable  law  at  this  time.  Compliance  with  this  Final  Order and  the  Final  Order on Liability  and Relief entered  on  February  16,  2011,  shall  occur  no  later than  28  days  from  the  date of mailing of this order.'  Reg.  250.210.   Notice  Regarding  Respondent's  Correspondence:  The  Commission  acknowledges  and  appreciates  receipt  of payment  by  Respondent of the  fine  imposed  in  the  Final  Order on  Liability  and Relief.  The  correspondence  from  Respondent's  owner,  Diran  Soulian,  included  documentation  of  payments  for  restroom  alterations  to  provide  wheelchair  accessibility.  The  Commission  thanks  Respondent  for  this  documentation  but,  as  a  reminder,  notes  that  a  copy  must  also  be  served  on  Complainant's  attorney  of  record  pursuant  to  the  Final  Order on Liability  and  Relief,  and  Respondent's  correspondence  does  not  clarify whether that was done.  See CCHR Reg.  270.210. In his correspondence, Soulian also asked where  to direct payment of the damages owed to Complainant.  These damages are payable to  Complainant,  not  the  Commission.  Thus  any  check  or  money  order  for  the  damages  should  be  made  payable  to  Complainant,  Anthony  Cotten,  but  because  Cotten  is  represented by  an  attorney,  the  payment should be  sent  to  the  attorney,  Matthew  Weems.  Payment  of the  attorney  fees  and  costs  now  ordered should  be  made payable and sent to  Attorney Weems.   CHICAGO COMMISSION ON HUMAN RELATIONS  Entered:  June  15, 2011   1  COMPLIANCE INFORMATION:  Parties must comply  with a final  order after administrative  hearing no  later than 28 days from the date of mailing of the later of a  Board of Commissioners' final  order on  liability or any  final  order on attorney fees  and costs, unless another date is  specified.  CCHR Reg.  250.210.  Enforcement procedures for  failure to comply are stated in Reg.  250.220.   Payments of attorney fees  and costs are to  be made to Complainant's attorney is of record.   City of Chicago    COMMISSION ON HUMAN RELATIONS    740 N.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY   On  February  16,  2011,  the  Commission  on  Human  Relations  issued  its  Final  Order  on  Liability  and  Relief in  this  matter,  in  favor  of Complainant  Anthony  Cotten  on  his  claim  that  Respondent Top  Notch  Beetburger Shop  discriminated against him on the basis  of disability by  failure  to  ensure  that he  as  a  wheelchair user received  equivalent  service  to  the  extent possible  without the  imposition of undue hardship.  The Final  Order was  mailed to the  parties on March  3, 2011.  The Commission ordered payment of $500 plus  interest in emotional distress damages,  plus  a  $500  fine  for  violation  of  the  Chicago  Human  Rights  Ordinance.  The  Commission  ordered injunctive relief to bring Respondent into compliance with the Human Rights Ordinance.  The Commission also awarded Complainant his  reasonable attorney fees  and costs subject to the  petition process set forth  in CCHR Reg.  240.630.   On  April  1,  2011,  Complainant's  attorney  filed  a  timely  petition  for  attorney  fees  including  his  affidavit  and  statement  of  time  spent  on  the  case.  Respondent  did  not  file  a  response.  The  hearing  officer  mailed  her  recommend  ruling  to  the  parties  on  May  18,  2011.  follows  by an amended recommended ruling  mailed on May  23,  2011.  which included notice of  the procedures for  filing  and serving objections to  the recommended ruling.  No objections were  received from either party.   Complainant's  counsel,  Matthew  Weems,  seeks  attorney  fees  of  $3,000  for  time  expended  plus  $22.03  in  travel  costs.  He  submitted an  affidavit  for  20  hours  of time  expended  and seeks compensation at the rate of $150 per hour.   II.   APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS   Section  10-120-510(1)  of the  Chicago  Municipal  Code  allows  the  Commission  to  award  reasonable  attorney  fees  to  a  prevailing  party  represented  by  counsel.  CCHR  Reg.  240.630(a)  requires  that  a  petition for  fees  be  suppmted  by  a statement  of time  in  segments  no  larger than  one-quarter  hour  that  also  identifies  the  manner  of  work  performed.  The  petition  must  also  establish  that  the  per-hour  rate  sought  is  the  normal  per-hour  rate  for  the  attorney.  The  Commission  uses  the  lodestar  method  for  determining  attorney  fees,  meaning  that  the  Commission  determines  whether  the  hours  spent  on  the  matter  were  reasonable  and  then  multiplies  those  hours  deemed  reasonable  by  the  normal  hourly  rate  charged  by  the  attorney.  See,  e.g.,  Leadership Council for Metropolitan  Open Communities v.  Souchet,  CCHR No.  98-H­ 1 07  (May  17,  2001 ).  The party seeking fees  has the burden of proving the request is  reasonable.   See,  e.g.,  Brooks  v.  Hyde  Park  Realty  Co.,  CCHR  No.  02-E-116  (June  16,  2004).  The  Commission  is  not required  to  award  attorney  fees  in  an  amount  proportional  to  the  amount  of  damages  awarded.  Lockwood  v.  Professional  Neurological  Services,  Ltd.,  CCHR  No.  06-E-89  (Jan.  20, 2010).   In  Lockwood,  the  Commission  further  explained  the  standards  it  utilizes,  incorporating   what are known as  the ""Hensley factors"":   law,   the  Commission  follows   the  ""lodestar""  method  of  As  under  federal  multiplying  reasonable  hourly  rates  by  hours  reasonably  expended  as  a  starting  point and treats  an  attorney's  actual  billing  rate  as  presumptively appropriate  for  use  as  the  market  rate.  If unable  to  determine  an  attorney's  actual  billing  rate,  then the Commission turns  to the next best evidence,  the rate charged by  lawyers  in  the  community  of  reasonably  comparable  skill,  experience,  and  reputation.  Once  the  amount  of fees  is  determined  using  the  lodestar  method,  then  the  fee  award may be adjusted by the ""Hensley factors""  ... although, as  the court noted in  lPeople Who  Care v.  Rockford Board of Education, 90 F.3d 1307,  1310-11  (7 Cir.  1996)1.  ""most  of  those  factors  are  usually  subsumed  within  the  initial  lodestar  calculation.""   The Hensley factors  are (1) the  time and labor required,  (2)  the  novelty  and difficulty of  the  questions,  (3)  the  skill  requisite  to  perform  the  legal  service  properly,  (4)  the  preclusion  of  employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case, (5) the customary fee,  (6)  whether the  fee  is  fixed or contingent, (7)  time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances, (8) the  amount  involved  and  the  results  obtained,  (9)  the  experience,  reputation  and  ability  of  the  attorneys,  ( 1 0)  the  ""undesirability""  of the  case,  ( 11)  the  nature  and  length  of the  professional  relationship  with  the  client,  and  (12)  awards  in  similar  cases.  S.  Rep.  No.  1011,  94th  Cong.2d  Sess. 6 (1976), as  cited in People Who  Care at n.  1; Hensley v.  Eckerhart, 461  U.S. 424 at 434 n.  9,  103  S.Ct.  1933 at 1940 n. 9.   Ill.  REASONABLE HOURLY RATE   The  applicant  bears  the  burden  of proving  that  the  requested  hourly  rate  is  reasonable.  Sellers  v.  Outland.  CCHR  No.  02-H-73  (May  17,  2004  and  April  15,  2009)  following  the  reasoning  set forth  in  Small v.  Richard Wolf Medica/Instruments  Corp.,  264 F.3d 702  (71 h  Cir.  2001).  The attorney's normal billing rate is  deemed presumptively the market rate. !d.   Here  Atty.  Weems  seeks  $150  per  hour  for  his  services.  His  affidavit  states  that  this  amount is  his normal per hourly rate charged for  such  services.  Respondent did not submit any  objections  to  the Complainant's petition.  The Commission awarded Atty.  Weems $140 per hour  in  matters during 2010; this  was  an  increase from $125 per hour awarded for  services performed  in  2009.  Cotten  v.  La  Luce Restaurant,  CCHR  No.  08-P-34  (October 20,  2010).  The hearing  officer recommend  that  the  hourly  rate  of $150  be  found  reasonable,  as  it  is  a  modest  increase  from  earlier  awards  to  Atty.  Weems  and  is  supported  by  an  affidavit  stating  it  is  the  attorney's  normal rate for  services  of this nature.  The Commission agrees  with  the unopposed request and  recommendation and so awards fees  at the rate of $150 per hour.   2    IV.   REASONABLE EXPENDITURES OF TIME    Atty.  Weems  is  requesting  fees  for  20 hours  of time  spent on this  matter.  His  time log,  submitted  in  15  minute  increments  as  required,  supports  this  time request.  The  hearing  officer  found,  however, that some of the combined totals  are not supported by the quality or quantity of  work  she  observed  in  presiding  over  the  hearing  and  pre-hearing  process.  The  hearing  officer  was  concerned  that  Atty.  Weems  is  seeking  only  .5  hour  for  meeting  with  his  client  over the  entire duration of this  case, and that was  at the beginning of the case.  She found that amount not  unreasonable but rather  insufficient as  revealed by the conduct of the hearing.  She recommend  that the time listed be found reasonable with the following exceptions:   Atty.  Weems  seeks  1.5  hours'  compensation to  draft a request to  produce.  Most,  if not  I.  all,  of  the  request  to  produce  is  clearly  repeated  from  the  numerous  other  accessibility  cases,  including  restroom accessibility cases,  in  which  Weems  represented this  Complainant.  In light  of the  limited  originality  of the  work,  the  hearing  officer  recommended  that  the  compensated  time be reduced by .5  hour to one hour.   2.  Atty.  Weems seeks 2.5  hours'  compensation to prepare for hearing.  Normally this  would  be  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  to  prepare  for  this  type  of  hearing.  However,  there  is  no  evidence that  Atty.  Weems  met  with  his  client prior to  the  hearing  (indeed the  only mention of  his  client  in  the  attorney  time  record  is  11  months  prior to  the  hearing)  and  the  hearing  officer  found  ample  observable  evidence  that  Atty.  Weems  was  not  prepared  at  the  hearing.  Atty.  Weems claims to have spent two hours drafting questions for the hearing, yet asked perhaps only  20  very  basic  questions.  His  one  exhibit  was  not  prepared  for  hearing.  It  was  clear  to  the  hearing  officer  that  Atty.  Weems  was  unprepared  to  ask  the  appropriate  questions,  had  not  prepared his witness adequately for the hearing, and had not prepared his  exhibit for the hearing.  Based on that performance,  she  recommended  that the  requested  hours  spent  in  preparation for  hearing should be reduced from 2.5  to  1.5.   3.  Atty.  Weems  seeks  2.5  hours'  compensation for  reviewing  the  recommended  ruling  on  liability and relief and  an additional 1.25 hours for reviewing the final order.  The hearing officer  found  this  excessive  and  recommended  that  the  total  for  both  activities  be  reduced  from  3.75  hours to 2.5  hours.   4.  Atty.  Weems  seeks  1.75  hours'  compensation for  preparing his  fee  petition.  Preparation  of  fee  petitions  is  compensable.  Huezo  v.  St.  James  Properties,  CCHR  No.  90-E-44  (Oct.  9,  1991).  However,  Atty.  Weems  has  sought compensation in  amounts  greater than  1.5  hours  for  this  activity  without  success  in  two  previous  cases,  yet  tries  once  again.  Cotten  v.  CCI  Industries,  Inc.,  CCHR No.  07-P-109  (May  19, 2010) and  Cotten  v.  La  Lace  Restaurant,  CCHR  No.  08-P-34 (Oct.  20, 2010).  The fee  petition submitted by Atty.  Weems is  a ""fill in the blanks""  variety;  indeed the blanks are clearly visible in the document.  The hearing officer recommended  that the Commission recognize once again that completing such a petition is  a simple matter and  reduce the compensated amount from  1.75  hours to  .5  hour.   In  Warren  et al  v.  Lofton &  Lofton Management d/b/a McDonatd:s et al.,  CCHR No.  07­  P-062 (May  19,  2010),  the Commission explained that a prevailing  complainant's counsel  shall  be compensated for all  time reasonably expended on the case,  and that in determining what time  expenditure  is  reasonable,  the  Commission  will  consider  the  specific  facts  of  the  case.  In  addition,  ""the hearing  officer  may  use  his  or her  own experience,  knowledge,  and  expertise  to  determine  the  amount  of time  reasonably  required  for  such  work.""  !d.;  see  also  Hutchison  v.  lftekaruddin,  CCHR No.  08-H-21 (June  16,  2010).   3    The  Commission has  regularly  awarded  lower  attorney  fees  where  requested  hours  are  found  excessive  for  the  work  performed.  See,  e.g.,  Edwards  v.  Larkin,  CCHR  No.  01-H-35  (Nov.  16,  2005);  Richardson v.  Chicago Area Council  of Boy Scouts,  CCHR No.  92-E-80 (Nov.  20,  1996) reversed on other grounds, 322 Ill.  App.  3d 17  (1st Dist.  2001), dismissed on remand,  CCHR  No.  92-E-80 (Feb.  20,  2002),  reducing the requested fee  by 25%;  Soria  v.  Kern,  CCHR  No.  95-H-13  (Nov.  20,  1996); and  White  v.  !son, CCHR No.  91-FH0-126-5711  (July 22,  1993).  6954  N.  See  also  the  Commission's  recent  discussion  of  excessive  charges  in  Rankin  v.  Sheridan,  Inc.,  DLG Management,  et al., CCHR No. 08-H-49 (May  18, 2011).   Here,  Complainant has  not objected to the hearing officer's  recommended  reductions  of  compensated  time  for  certain  activities,  nor  has  Respondent  objected  to  the  hearing  officer's  recommended  award.  The  Commission  finds  the  hearing  officer's  recommendations  well­ supported  and  approves  her  proposed  line-item  reductions.  Like  the  hearing  officer,  the  Commission  is  troubled at  the  minimal  preparation  and  presentation  by Atty.  Weems  on behalf  of his  client in this  case while seeking compensation for time and effort not well-reflected in his  work  product.  Especially  now  that  he  has  had  handled  a  number  of similar  cases  before  this  Commission,  Atty.  Weems  should  be  well-aware  of what  is  needed  to  demonstrate  his  client's  entitlement  to  relief.  The  Commission  has  decided  not  to  impose  an  additional  percentage  reduction  of  his  fee  award  in  this  case  given  the  lack  of  objection  and  the  approval  of  a  significant reduction of 20% from the total hours claimed based on the hearing officer's analysis.  See Rankin,  supra.  However, pursuant to  the  Hensley factors  cited  above,  the Commission will  continue to scrutinize whether a prevailing attorney's charges for  particular and overall work are  reasonable  in light of all  circumstances  in  the case,  including the level  of difficulty of the  work  performed and the observable work product.   The  approved  line-item  reductions  result  in  a  total  deduction  of  four  hours  from  the  requested  20  hours,  for  a total of 16  hours  approved as  reasonable.  At the approved hourly rate  of $150, this results in an award of attorney fees  of $2,400.   V. 	  COSTS   Complainant's  counsel  seeks  $22.03   the  Commission.  Atty.  Weems  stated the distance from his  home to  the Commission as  10.8  miles  and sought $.51  per mile  for  two  round  trips,  a total  of $22.03.  The hearing  officer found  this  request reasonable.  The Commission agrees and approves $23.03 in costs.   to   in  costs,  for  mileage  for   two  trips   VII. 	 CONCLUSION   The Commission finds  that Complainant is  entitled to reasonable attorney fees  of $2,400  and  associated  costs  of $22.03,  for  a  total  of $2,422.03  payable  to  Attorney  Matthew  Weems.  Respondent  is  ordered to  pay this  amount to  Atty.  Weems  as  provided by Section 2-120-510(1),  Chicago Muni. Code, and CCHR Regs. 240.630 and 250.210.
