Commissioner’s Update: Julie Morita, Commissioner provided the following updates:    CDPH 2017 BUDGET   Mayor Emanuel recently released his 2017 Budget Proposal to the City Council. CDPH has been very  intently preparing for our City Council Budget Hearing, which is scheduled to be held on Wednesday  October  26  at  10am  in  the  City  Hall  Council  Chambers.    Commissioner  Morita  reported  that  she  is  especially  proud  of  our  work  to  align  CDPH’s  budget  proposal  with  the  vision  laid  out  in  Healthy  Chicago 2.0. She believes that the expanded support for drug treatment, violence prevention, our school  based vision program, and mental health services will not only improve outcomes in Chicago but also  help close the health disparities that adversely impact our most vulnerable communities and looks forward  to working with other departments and agencies in 2017 as CDPH continues to expand our Health in All  Policies efforts.    Commissioner Morita highlighted a few key priorities in CDPH’s 2017 budget and how they aligned with  the vison to improve health equity.  •   In 2016, CDPH and our partners at the Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago provided seed  funding to six community-based organizations to jump start new initiatives in communities with the  greatest need. Our 2017 budget builds on this promise of Healthy Chicago 2.0 by providing additional  seed  grant  dollars  that  will  help  build  the  capacity  and  knowledge  of  small,  community-based  organizations to launch new, evidence-based initiatives to help develop their communities.   •  Substance  use  disorder treatment  will  expand  by  50  percent  by  increasing  our investment  with  an  additional $700,000. These dollars will help counter the national opioid epidemic here in Chicago by  increasing the availability of treatment services   •  Since its launch in 2013, CDPH’s school-based vision program has provided more than 64,000 pairs  of eyeglasses to students at no cost to them or their families, helping ensure our children have every  opportunity to succeed in the classroom. CDPH plans to build on this enormous success by investing  an additional $250,000 into the program, helping us expand to more schools and provide more exams  for more children.   •  Understanding that violence is a problem that requires a holistic approach across city agencies, CDPH  plans to build on our successful prevention and response programs in 2017. This includes investing an  additional $250,000 in the Crisis Recovery and Response Program which deploys crisis responders to  offer immediate psychological first aid and bereavement support to survivors, including family and  community members, of gun violence. Survivors are assisted with their immediate needs including  referrals to mental health services to minimize trauma and reduce further acts of violence. More than  597 families have been helped with this program since its launch. CDPH plans to grow our Crisis  Intervention Program (CIP). When a resident in a mental health crisis is interfacing with the police, a  community-based  group  will  provide  mental  health triage  services in  a  hospital  setting  to  link  the  individual to appropriate mental health services. Following a successful pilot, CDPH looks to expand  funding by an additional $100,000 in 2017.     MENTAL HEALTH EXPANSION  •  Cook  County  Health  and  Hospitals  System  will  manage  mental  health  services  at  our  Roseland   Neighborhood Health Center early next year, which will expand services for youth    and children and also allow our mental health team members to expand their work at other locations  across the city.            Chicago Board of Health   Meeting Summary: October 19, 2016  DePaul Center, 333 South State Street   SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS (SBHC)  •  On September 23rd, Commissioner Morita joined Mayor Emanuel, 3rd Ward Alderman Pat Dowell,  CPS  officials,  and  other  stakeholders,  as  CDPH  announced  a  new  School  Based  Health  (SBHC)  Center at Drake Elementary School in Armour Square on the South Side. This will be the 33rd SBHC  in the city and the second to be built under a pledge from Mayor Emanuel to use revenue from the e- cigarette tax to increase health services for CPS students. Once open, the site will serve as a primary  medical home for 400 students and community members, providing more opportunities for our youth  to get healthy and stay healthy.      ILLINOIS VACCINES FOR CHILDREN UPDATE  •  Due  to  changes  made  to  the  VFC  program  by  IDPH  and  HFS,  as  of  October  1,  2016,  children  enrolled in the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (not Medicaid or Medicaid expansion) are  no  longer  be  eligible  for  vaccines  through  the  VFC  program.  Healthcare  providers  serving  these  children now need to purchase private stock vaccine and submit claims to their patients’ insurance  companies for reimbursement.  Responding to provider and professional organization concerns, both  Illinois VFC and Chicago VFC programs acquired approval for 317 CDC emergency fund vaccine on  September 30, 2016.  It is available to a limited number of providers for a 6-8 week transition period  after the October 1, 2016 implementation date or until funds are depleted.       •  CDPH has made vaccine available for Title 21 patients at 5 Fast Track Immunization clinics. We do  not expect the 317 vaccine to cover every Title 21 child that requires vaccination but hope that it will  give providers more time to purchase private vaccine for these patients.  There is a focused effort  underway with CDPH, HFS and MCOs to ensure that the vaccine reimbursement process for Title 21  insured children is updated in a timely manner.  CDPH continues to maintain close communication  with professional provider organizations, IDPH and HFS to identify challenges associated with the  transition.     FLU CLINICS  •  Flu Season is almost here, and the Immunization Team is working hard to get CDPH and Chicago  prepared. CDPH already launched our 2017 flu clinics, which for the second year in a row, includes  events in all 50 wards. In addition, CDPH will host five Family Flu clinics on November 5th and  November  12th.  Our  ad  campaign,  #IGotMine,  has  started  appearing  on  buses  and  social  media,  running through the end of the year. CDPH will provide flu shots at select CDPH and City of Chicago  locations.      ENROLL CHICAGO  •  City  of  Chicago  efforts  to  enroll  residents  in  quality,  affordable  health  coverage  continues  with  coordination from CDPH’s Enroll Chicago initiative. The 4th open enrollment period for the private  insurance  Marketplace  under  the  Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA)  begins  on  November  1  and  ends  on  January  31.  Enrollment  in  Illinois  Medicaid,  for  low  and  moderate  income  residents,  is  all  year  around.  CDPH  is  closely  coordinating  with  City  Departments,  Sister  Agencies,  and  community  stakeholders on resident engagement, education and enrollment. These efforts align with the Health  Chicago 2.0 strategic priorities.   •  CDPH recently coordinated with the Office of Emergency Management and Communications     (OEMC) to have a message played to 311 callers during the open enrollment period: ""IF YOU ARE  LOOKING  FOR  HEALTH  INSURANCE,  YOU  MAY  BE  ELIGIBLE  FOR  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  THROUGH  THE  AFFORDABLE  CARE  ACT.

Comments by the Board President:  Dr. Lopez welcomed the students and provided an overview of the  board’s history and explained the board’s advisory role in matters of infectious disease and health issues  affecting public health.    Policy Update:  Jesse Lava provided the following policy updates:  •  The Heroin Task Force report was released and included a variety of recommendations. I'll  get to   those in the presentation so I'll hold back on that now.   •  Commissioner Morita submitted public comments to HFS on the proposed 1115 waiver for Medicaid  As  you  may  recall,  the  waiver  will  request  $1.2  billion  targeting  behavioral  health,  with  the  expectation that these investments will save dollars over the long run. Our public comments said the  vision is right and the strategies are promising. Investing in behavioral health is a great way to serve  human needs while reducing costs since the subset of the population with behavioral health issues  now consume a disproportionate amount of our state's Medicaid resources. Now it's time to flesh out  the details to ensure the vision is fulfilled. These details include financing priorities, the need for rate  reform, and other areas.   •  The Health in All Policies Task Force has created a working group that is meeting monthly and will  soon be developing recommendations on how City departments can work more effectively to promote  health.

The report contained 28 recommendations to increase employment opportunities for youth,  promote restorative justice in our schools, keep more youth out of the juvenile justice system,  improve relationships between officers and youth, treat trauma, and increase access to safe  places and activities. The Commission worked collaboratively over three months and talked  to over 200 youth in 20 different neighborhoods to develop these recommendations. The  complete report is available at www.cityofchicago.org/saferchicago.    Over the past three months, members of the Commission – including City staff and community  partners – have been hard at work implementing the report’s recommendations. Below is  a detailed progress report, prepared by the Commission’s co-chairs, on the Commission’s  accomplishments during the first quarter of 2015.    Working Group Updates  Youth Employment  Co-Chairs:   Torrey Barrett, KLEO Center      Evelyn Diaz, Commissioner, Department of Family and Support Services Andrea Zopp, Chicago Urban League       In  Chicago,  the  neighborhoods  experiencing  the  highest  rates  of  violence  are  also  some  of  the  most  economically  challenged.  During  the  Commission’s  conversations  with  youth  and community members, a common theme emerged: to stop violence, youth need to be  prepared to work and have access to jobs. Over the past three years, the City has expanded  youth summer jobs from 14,000 to 22,500.  While a summer job is an important first step  toward higher education and career success, the Commission recognized that many youth  need additional support and training in “21st Century skills” before they can translate that  summer job into unsubsidized private sector employment.   I 1 I      Commission Recommendations:   - Develop a common curriculum focused on workforce readiness and career planning and     pilot it with several summer jobs providers in 2015   - Design a training bridge to continue workforce skills training after the completion of a     summer job    - Cultivate richer employment partnerships to increase the availability of job opportunities     for youth and prepare youth to be successful in those jobs   - Survey 1000 One Summer Chicago Plus participants to assess their skills, interests, and     educational needs, and    - Use those survey results to connect One Summer Chicago Plus participants to existing     year-round education and employment opportunities.   First quarter achievements include the following:  • Inspired by the Commission’s work and vision for youth employment, Earvin Johnson and      Mark Walter will invest $10M over the next 2 years to support the expansion of the One    Summer Chicago Plus (OSC+), a youth employment program for justice-involved youth.    This summer, that investment will support the expansion of the program from 1000 to    2000 youth.   • Earlier this year, the Chicago Department of Family and Support Service (DFSS) issued    its request for proposals (RFP) for both of the City’s summer jobs programs – One    Summer Chicago and One Summer Chicago Plus, and the RFP period just closed. This    year, for the first time, payroll for youth summer jobs will be handled centrally.   • Starting in April, youth will be able to apply for One Summer Chicago jobs online. The    Commission will circulate a link to the application as soon as it is live.     • The Commission has enlisted the Civic Leadership Foundation to develop a new    workforce training program and skills assessment for OSC+ providers to use during the    summer.   I 2 I    Health and Healing  Co-Chairs:   Colleen Cicchetti, Ann & Robert H Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago      Colleen Jones, Metropolitan Family Services Marlita White, Chicago Department of Public Health       To continue reducing violence, the Commission agreed it must expand efforts to address  trauma in some of Chicago’s most vulnerable young people. The Health and Healing working  group recommended that the City and its partners respond to homicide incidents and expand  training in trauma-informed care and the impact of adverse childhood experiences (“ACEs”), so  that people who come into contact with youth and families are equipped to interrupt the cycle  of violence by assisting those youth and families and referring them for necessary services. The  group made 6 key recommendations:   Commission Recommendations:   - Pilot a homicide crisis response protocol to provide immediate support for victims and     families in the wake of a homicide and to facilitate referrals to ongoing services   - Develop common core training standards for trauma-informed care and identifying the     impacts of ACEs   - Pilot the incorporation of ACEs screenings into standard intake procedures for healthcare     providers   - Map opportunities to engage families impacted by trauma to analyze service gaps and     identify frontline workers who need training on best practices   -Expand teen dating violence prevention education to make it available to all educators and     school employees and    -Launch a campaign to engage communities in efforts to address the effects of childhood     exposure to trauma.  I 3 I  First quarter achievements include the following:  • In 2014, the Chicago Department of Public Health received funding from the Department     of Justice to pilot a homicide crisis response system to minimize trauma and reduce     further acts of violence. The City is partnering with Thresholds and Chicago Survivors to       develop and test that response system in 2015. Training is underway for the pilot, which     is on track to launch later this spring. Trained responders will be dispatched to provide     immediate support and services to victims’ families and to link families to long-term     services.     • Commission representatives have met with and presented to several groups in Chicago     that work on issues of childhood trauma and exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences     (ACEs,) to discuss how to coordinate around common core training and outreach efforts.   • Working group members are in active discussions with three physicians’ groups to     discuss piloting the inclusion of ACEs screenings in health care settings.   Creating Restorative School Communities  Co-Chairs:   Jadine Chou, Chief Safety and Security Officer, Chicago Public Schools        Father David Kelly, Precious Blood Ministry of Reconciliation  Karen VanAusdal, Directior of the Office of Social Emotional Learning,  Chicago Public Schools         A high school diploma is one of the most important protections against violence. Chicago   Public Schools, members of the Commission, and other stakeholders have worked to develop   strategies to replace the exclusionary discipline practices that were funneling some youth to   the criminal justice system with restorative practices that prevent and de-escalate conflict.    The  Creating  Restorative  School  Communities  working  group  focused  on  expanding  that   work  to  promote  a  more  restorative  school  culture  and  engaging  entire  communities  -   especially parents - to strengthen outcomes. The group made six key recommendations:  I 4 I   Commission Recommendations:   - Establish 3 new community-based restorative justice hubs to support and complement     the restorative practices work being undertaken in schools   - Train and place parents into at least 4 new schools to participate in and help lead     restorative practices through Parent Peace Centers   - Seek funding to create a principal challenge grant program to encourage principals to     develop and implement proposals to employ restorative practices in their schools   - Develop a restorative practices “toolkit” of techniques and support materials to help      schools expand their use of restorative practices.   - Conduct coordinated principal outreach and peer-to-peer education and   - Develop and promote a restorative practices education campaign for parents and     community stakeholders.  First quarter achievements include the following:  • In 2015, CPS and COFI/POWER-PAC, with support from the Illinois Juvenile Justice    Commission (IJJC), partnered to open 4 new Parent Peace Centers at Melody, Reavis,    Nixon, and Courtenay elementary schools. CPS also recently secured funding from the    IJJC to expand to 3 additional sites in Englewood before the end of the school year. The    Parent Peace Centers use trained “peacemakers” from the community to provide    restorative techniques like peace circles, restorative conversations, and future planning to    address student conflict and misconduct. The Peace Centers complement changes to the    CPS student code of conduct and discipline policies to encourage the use of restorative    practices instead of exclusionary discipline.   • On February 5, CPS hosted a restorative practices education panel, in which principals,    deans, and coaches who have experience using restorative practices with school climate    supports engaged in peer-to-peer education with principals who are newer to the process      and will be receiving restorative practices coaches from the Office of Social and Emotional     Learning.   • CPS and restorative justice practitioners throughout the city are in the process of    collaborating to develop the restorative practices toolkit. By gathering materials from    several organizations engaged in this work and agreeing on common principles and    definitions, CPS will soon be prepared to offer a comprehensive set of proven techniques    and tools to schools interested in expanding their use of restorative practices.  I 5 I  • A coalition of organizations, including United Methodist Church (Commission Member       Reverend Biekman) and Community Justice for Youth Institute have received a grant for     training and technical assistance to support capacity-building for restorative justice work     within community organizations.  Safety and Justice  Co-Chairs:  Eddie Bocanegra, Co-Director of Violence Prevention, YMCA of     Metropolitan Chicago                 Chief Robert Tracy, Chicago Police Department  Janey Rountree, Deputy Chief of Staff for Public Safety, Chicago Mayor’s Office  The Safety and Justice working group, recognizing the need to reconsider youth’s contact   with  law  enforcement,  focused  on  two  separate  but  related  issues:  expanding  diversion   programs, and improving youth-police relationships.   Commission Recommendations to keep more youth out of the juvenile justice system:   - Expand the RISE diversion pilot to serve more arrested youth   - Identify best practices for engaging parents to help identify the drivers of misconduct        and connect families to services and   - Develop alternatives to arrest for first-time youth offenders.  Commission Recommendations to improve relationships between youth and officers:    - Expand a new program, Bridging the Divide, created by the YMCA and Chicago      Police Department to engage youth and police in meaningful conversation, healing, and      relationship-building   - Host a CAPS competition to encourage and recognize officers who develop innovative      ways to build better relationships with youth and   - Create a grant program through which youth can seek funding in support of youth-led      peace projects.

Under 65  ILCS  5/11-74.4-3(q)(7), such incremental ad valorem taxes which   pursuant to the Act have been collected and are allocated to pay redevelopment project costs  and obligations  incurred in the payment thereof (""Increment"") may be used to pay all or a  portion of a taxing district's capital costs resulting from a redevelopment project necessarily  incurred or to be incurred in furtherance of the objectives of the redevelopment plan and project,  to the extent the municipality by written agreement accepts and approves such costs.  Increment collected from the 63rd/Ashland Area shall be known as the"" 63rd/Ashland  Increment"" and placed into the ""63rd/Ashland Area TIF  Fund"".   I.   Pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-74.4-4(q) of the Act, the City can use Increment from   one redevelopment project area for eligible redevelopment project costs in another  redevelopment project area that is  either contiguous to, or is separated only by a public right of  way from, the redevelopment project area from which those Incremental Taxes is received (the  ""Transfer Rights"").   J.   In accordance with the provisions of the Act, and  pursuant to ordinances adopted   on  May 9,  1996 and published in the Journal for said date at pages 21486-21579 and 21581- 21594, the  City Council: (i) approved and adopted a redevelopment plan and project (the ""60th  and Western Plan"") for a portion of the City known as the ""60th and Western Redevelopment  Project Area"" (the ""60th and Western Area""); (ii) designated the 60th and Western Area as a  ""redevelopment project area""; and (iii) adopted tax increment allocation financing for the 60th  and Western Area (collectively (i)-(iii), the ""Original 60th and Western Ordinances"").  Increment collected from the 60th and Western Area shall  be known as the ""60th and Western  Increment"" and placed into the"" 60th and Western Area TIF  Fund"".   K.   Pursuant to the amendments adopted by the City Council on October 7,  1998  and published in the Journal for said date at pages 78244-78401  and 78404-78409, the City  Council amended the Original 60th and Western Ordinances to add certain parcels to the 60th  and Western Area (the ""Amendment"" together with the Original 60th and Western Ordinances  are referred to herein as the ""60th  and Western Ordinances"").   L.   The 63rd/Ashland Area is either contiguous to, oris separated only by a public   right of way from the 60th and Western Area.   M.   HED wishes to exercise its Transfer Rights pursuant to the Act and the 60th and   Western and 63rd/Ashland Redevelopment Plans and will  transfer a portion of the 60th and  Western Increment from the 60th and Western Area TIF Fund into the 63rd/Ashland Area TIF  Fund, in an  amount not to exceed $400,000 (the ""TIF Assistance""), to pay or reimburse the  Park District for expenses incurred in the rehabilitation and  improvement of the Property (the  ""TIF-Funded Improvements"") in the 63rd/Ashland Area to the extent and in the manner  provided in this Agreement.   2   N.   The 63rd/Ashland Plan contemplates that tax  increment financing assistance   would be provided for public improvements, such as the Project, within the boundaries of the  63rd/Ashland Area.   0.   P.   The Park District is a taxing district under the Act.   In accordance with the Act, the TIF-Funded Improvements shall  include such of   the Park District's capital costs necessarily incurred or to be incurred in furtherance of the  objectives of the Plan, and the City has  found that the TIF-Funded Improvements consist of the  cost of the Park District's capital improvements that are necessary and directly result from the  redevelopment project constituting the Project and, therefore, constitute ""taxing districts' capital  costs"" as defined in Section 5/11-74.4-3(u) of the Act.   Q.   The City and the Park District wish to enter into this Agreement whereby the Park   District shall undertake the Project and the City shall pay or reimburse the Park District for the  TIF-Funded Improvements made pursuant to the Project.

This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,278 feet of 8-inch water main in W. North Shore Avenue,  from N. Glenwood Avenue to N. Sheridan Road. The old pipe dates back to 1904, and needs to  be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman O’Connor’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,278 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. North Shore Avenue, from N. Glenwood Avenue to N. Sheridan Road.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1904 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by mid May 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. North Shore Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                                                 ALDERMAN PATRICK O’CONNOR   3-1-1   773- 769-1140   312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid May 2013.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,121 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Harding Avenue, from  470 feet north of W. Argyle Street to W. Ainslie Street. The old pipe dates back to 1909, and  needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Laurino’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,121 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Harding Avenue, from 470 feet north of W. Argyle Street to W. Ainslie Street.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in early January 2014. Restoration will follow in mid April 2014. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Harding Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN MARGARET LAURINO   773- 736-5594                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in early  January 2014. Restoration will be follow in mid April 2014. We always hesitate to promise  specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere  in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

This proposed budget provides for operations, maintenance and debt  service of Chicago O’Hare and Midway International Airports.     2013 continues to be a very big and historic year for Chicago’s airports.     -  We commissioned new Runway 10C-28C under the O’Hare Modernization   Program.                   -  O’Hare welcomed four international carriers that together will create $515 million   in annual economic impact for the region.     -  Midway had the busiest year in its 85-year history with more than 19.5 million   passengers in 2012 and it has added service to 12 new markets including two  international markets this year.      -  We implemented 1-Stop and Automated Passport Control to improve efficiency   and reduce passenger wait times for customs processing at O’Hare.     -  We opened a new $55 million Consolidated Rental Car Facility at Midway.      -  The CDA secured a $288 million TIFIA loan from the USDOT to help finance   construction on an $800 million multi-modal joint-use facility at O’Hare that will  create 3,000 construction and 100 permanent jobs.    -  We launched a completely redesigned and more user-friendly FlyChicago website   for O’Hare and Midway.   -  We are nearing completion of a $26 million redevelopment of O’Hare’s   International Terminal 5 concessions program.    -  We are introducing several new, exciting retail and service concessions at   O’Hare.     Chicago Department of Aviation Mission  The CDA independently manages both O’Hare and Midway International Airports as  Enterprise Funds, segregated and separate from all other City funds. As Enterprise Funds,  the airports are independent, self-supporting entities reliant upon the funds generated at  each respective airport and do not receive any local taxes or revenues. Revenues consist  of those from landing fees and terminal rents derived from the airlines, as well as revenue  generated from car rental, parking, food and beverage and retail. Combined, these  revenues cover the full cost of airport operations, maintenance and debt service and the  costs incurred by other City departments providing support to the CDA.    All major capital improvement projects at Chicago’s airports are also financed without  the use of city property tax and/or state tax revenues. Funding for these projects comes  from airline-backed bonds, Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs), Customer Facility  Charges (CFCs) and Federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funds.   1      The CDA manages and accounts for airports in a manner similar to that of a business  venture, with a premise of increasing value to “our shareholders” which include our  airline partners, the business community, the traveling public and the City of Chicago.     The Chicago Department of Aviation’s core mission is the following:     -  Ensure safe and efficient travel through O’Hare and Midway International   -  Enhance economic activity and job creation within the City of Chicago and the   -  Continue to grow Chicago’s airports’ competitive positions in the global aviation   Airports.   region.   marketplace.   -  Provide the very best services and amenities in an environment that reflects   Chicago’s rich, diverse and unique character.   -  Successfully implement the O’Hare Modernization Program (OMP).  -  Continue to be the international leader in airport sustainability by integrating   environmental best practices into all aspects of the airports.      State of the Industry    Consolidation among U.S. airlines has left fewer competitors in the marketplace. In 2008,  Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines merged to become the new Delta. In 2010,  United Airlines and Continental Airlines merged to become the world’s largest airline.  That same year, Southwest Airlines acquired AirTran Airways, and is now in the process  of integrating into a single brand. This year, US Airways and American Airlines  announced their intention to merge.    Consolidation has helped airlines implement strategic and structural changes to achieve  positive net margins. Airports have been affected differently.     Fortunately, the Chicago market has grown thanks to the commitment of our major  carriers: United, American and Southwest Airlines.     Economic Power of Chicago’s Airports  Chicago’s airports continue to be powerful economic engines, generating nearly $45  billion in economic activity and 540,000 jobs in our city, the region and state. In addition,  the OMP will create up to 195,000 new jobs and add $18 billion to the region’s economy.  Approximately 45,000 badged employees work at Chicago’s airports.    O’Hare and Midway provide significant tax revenue to the City’s Corporate Fund. In  fact, Chicago’s airports were responsible for providing more than $122.7 million in tax  revenue to the City in 2012, compared with $113.6 million in 2011.    State of the Airports  Chicago’s airports continue to maintain their financial and operational strength. An  airport’s operational strength is measured by its volume of passengers and operations.

Air Cargo Operations  The air cargo industry plays a major economic role in Chicago and the region. According  to Airports Council International (ACI) rankings, O’Hare ranks seventh in the U.S. in  terms of air cargo tonnage with more than 1.2 million tons of air cargo handled in 2012.  With about $115 billion worth of freight handled annually, O’Hare ranks second among  all U.S. airports for the monetary value of its cargo. The airport currently serves more  than 30 cargo airlines that fly to business centers around the globe.

There was a $67.945 million increase in the overall O’Hare budget which is mostly  attributed to increases in new contracts, contractual price escalations and debt service.    Safety and Security   Ensuring safety and security for travelers and airport employees is the CDA’s top  priority. A full complement of Chicago Police Department officers, Aviation Security  officers and private security guards, as well as more than 30 federal, state and local  partner agencies, support the CDA’s multi-layered safety and security mission.    In 2013, the CDA implemented an online airport badging application process at both  airports to improve efficiency.     A Facilities Inspection Team Program comprised of the CFD Fire Prevention Bureau,  CDA terminal managers, CDA Assistant Chief Operating Engineers, CDA Real Estate  and CDA Safety employees was also created to identify hazards and risks and coordinate  the necessary corrective actions to mitigate. This program has resulted in reduced  insurance premiums for both airports.    We implemented a security checkpoint wait time monitoring pilot program at Midway  which utilizes Bluetooth and WiFi technology to provide real-time data to the TSA so  they can better manage checkpoint wait times. A similar program was launched at  O’Hare in September 2013. The CDA expects to complete the pilot program in 2014 and  select a vendor to install a permanent technology to monitor wait times.    The CDA regularly hosts and participates in classes and exercises with its federal, state,  city and airport partners in order to test its preparedness to react and respond to any type  of incident.     In 2013, a new Chicago Fire Department Command (CFD) Van 2-7-8 was added to the  airports’ fleet of emergency response vehicles. The command van is compliant with the  National Incident Management System (NIMS). It features state-of-the-art  communications equipment (cellular, radio and satellite), a conference room equipped  with communications equipment and large screen monitors, built-in video cameras and  basic amenities for command staff.      4        The CDA and CFD will conduct a full-scale airport emergency exercise at O’Hare in  2014 which is required by the FAA to be completed every three years.    Health and safety of airport employees  The health and safety of airport employees is also a priority for the CDA. Empowering  and motivating employees to maintain good physical health and overall well-being are an  important part of the CDA’s ability to manage and operate the airports.    In addition, the fourth Annual Safety, Health and Wellness Expo will be held November  19th at O’Hare and November 20th at Midway. The event is intended to increase  employee safety awareness on the job, and to empower CDA employees to improve their  health and well-being through a variety of health screenings, education and activities to  support positive lifestyle changes. Participants include Gatorade, Costco, Healthways,  Chicago Department of Public Health and many more.    Airport Operations  The CDA works tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure safe and efficient operations at  O’Hare and Midway.     Both airports continually meet FAA safety guidelines and standards routinely monitored  during FAA compliance and airfield inspections. Midway received a perfect score on the  FAA Part 139 annual inspection in 2013 and O’Hare passed with flying colors.    Human Resources/Training  The CDA has partnered with the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) to  develop comprehensive online training for the Security and Airfield Operations (Part  139) divisions of O'Hare and Midway. Both trainings are required by the TSA and FAA  and support the CDA’s mission of bringing more online content training to its employees.  This training is web-based and includes a Learning Management System (LMS) that  scores tests and tracks employee training. With this system, the CDA can train hundreds  of employees without incurring additional personnel cost. The CDA completed O’Hare  and Midway Security Identification Display Area (SIDA) training. In 2014, Midway  expects to complete the AAAE Midway Part 139 Certification Online Training.    The CDA is in the process of upgrading its Labor Management System (LMS) to include  automation of disciplinary appeal and review forms; creation of auto send emails of pre- discipline notices to Union representatives; and automatic close out of untimely union  responses to grievances. Upgrades are scheduled to be complete by November 1, 2013.    Community Outreach, Transparency and MBE/WBE/DBE Participation  The CDA is committed to seeking any and all available opportunities for M/W/DBEs to  participate in aviation related work. We continue to engage in significant outreach efforts  to ensure that any and all firms in Chicago are aware of upcoming CDA contracting  opportunities. To that end, the CDA either hosted or participated in 20 outreach sessions  all over the City.         5      reached an agreement with Westfield that provides outstanding results for our airport, the  traveling public and the City. The redevelopment will create over 400 new concession  jobs by the time it’s complete.    Westfield began the $26 million redevelopment program in 2012. The work includes a  renovated interior, new, upgraded restrooms, a redesigned and more efficient TSA  checkpoint and enhanced retail and dining offerings past the security checkpoint.    To date, Westfield has opened 13 new concessions spaces post-security while  maintaining an active terminal.     The new dining options that have already opened include Tortas Frontera by Rick  Bayless, Big Bowl by Lettuce Entertain You, Kofe powered by Intelligentsia and Tocco,  a local concept featuring rustic Italian fare. More innovative, high quality dining  establishments from Lettuce Entertain You are coming as part of a new airside food  court. The Goddess & Grocer, a local gourmet deli shop, will open pre-security early next  year.    For retail, local chocolatier Vosges Haut Chocolat, Swatch, 2 new duty-free stores by  Dufry, four new Hudson stores and O’Hare’s first-ever spa/salon, XpresSpa have already  opened. Next month, a local shop called I Love Chicago will open with products such as  original artwork and unique accessories by local artists. More new retail to come includes  luxury shops from renowned designers Michael Kors, Salvatore Ferragamo, Emporio  Armani, and a luxury watch boutique.     Since the redevelopment began in earnest in July 2012, sales have increased by over 15  percent, even with fewer concessions units open as the program transitions from pre- to  post-security.    As shown below, concessions sales per enplanement continues to increase at Terminal 5.       2011:     2012:       2013 (forecast):  2014 (forecast):    $15.78 (prior to redevelopment)  $16.80 (6.5 percent increase over 2011)  $18.51 (10.1 percent increase over 2012)              $26.00 (41 percent increase over 2013)     Technology  The CDA’s website, FlyChicago.com, has more than three million unique visitors each  year. In May 2013, the CDA and its airport Wi-Fi provider, Boingo, launched “The Good  Stuff” portal, which provides travelers at both airports with complimentary Wi-Fi access  to over 30 websites. Limited time complimentary Wi-Fi service was also offered  periodically throughout the year through sponsorship opportunities.     Growing Non-Airline Revenue  The CDA entered into an agreement in 2013 to develop, install and operate new indoor  commercial advertising concessions at both airports. The new advertising platform will  replace static ads with interactive, digital displays and will generate approximately $25  million annually. In addition, for the first time the CDA has procured an outdoor      9
