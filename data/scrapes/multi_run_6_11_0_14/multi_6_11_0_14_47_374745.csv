This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,683 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Keeler Avenue, from W.  55th Street to W. 57th Street, and W. 56th Street, from S. Keeler Avenue to S. Pulaski Road. The  old pipe dates back to 1924, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Quinn’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:          MARLON BRANDO      In New York City, the first Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade was held.     The IBM Corporation was founded.      The first crossword puzzle book was published.    Judy Garland, age 2, made her show business debut as “Baby Frances.”      Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming became the first female to be elected U.S. Governor.    British comedian Benny Hill, former New York Mayor Ed Koch, cosmetics/fashion   entrepreneur Gloria Vanderbilt, and American actor Marlon Brando were born.     Calvin Coolidge became the first President of the United States to deliver a radio   broadcast from the White House.                             KEELER AVE. & 56TH ST. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,683 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Keeler Avenue, from W. 55th Street to W. 57th Street, and W. 56th Street, from  S. Keeler Avenue to S. Pulaski Road.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1924 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in early May 2014. In addition, following the completion of the water main  work, a new sewer main will be installed. Final restoration will follow the completion of the  sewer main installation. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is  any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Keeler Avenue and W. 56th Street outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN MARTY QUINN   773-581-8000   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                                                     FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in early  May 2014. In addition, following the completion of the water main work, a new sewer main will  be installed. Final restoration will follow the completion of the sewer main installation. We  always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather  and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

Authority and Purpose    The  rules  and  regulations  set  forth  herein  are  promulgated  pursuant  to  the  authority  granted  to  the  Chief  Procurement  Officer (“CPO”) of the City of Chicago (“City”) pursuant to Section 8-10-16(a) of the Municipal Purchasing Act for Cities of  500,000 or More Population, 65 ILCS 5/8-10-1 et seq. (“Purchasing Act”), and Section 2-92-010 of the Municipal Code of  Chicago (“Code”).    The purpose of these rules and regulations is to set forth the parameters, policies and procedures for the City of Chicago  with respect to the participation of Established Businesses in the City’s MBE/WBE Program pursuant to the new Section  2-92-470 of the Code.  Unless otherwise explicitly stated herein, mandatory language is directed at employees of the City  of Chicago.      II. Priorities     A. Participation.  The reason that DPS provides an open, fair and timely public procurement process is to furnish  the  people  of  Chicago  with  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  business  of  City  government.    DPS’  commitment  to  its  MBE, WBE, BEPD, DBE, ACDBE, small and local businesses remains of paramount importance.     In order to maximize diversity in the City’s contracting, Established Businesses, i.e., firms for which annual average gross  receipts  have  surpassed  the  limits  stated  in  Section  2-92-470  of  the  Code,  will  remain  eligible  to  receive  MBE  or  WBE  credit,  albeit  at  reduced  levels,  for  up  to  three  years  beyond  the  point  at  which  the  firms  have  become  Established  Businesses.     At any time, should the MBE or WBE firm be able to show evidence that it meets the requirements for eligibility for listing  in the City’s directory of certification eligible businesses (“C.E.B.s”), the firm may electronically reapply for certification.      B.  Creating  Opportunities.    During  their  first  year  as  an  Established  Business,  MBE  and WBE  firms  will  receive  75% credit for participation in new City contracts, i.e., for each dollar ($1.00) paid to such firms, the prime contractor will  be credited for seventy-five cents ($0.75) of participation.  For new contracts in the second year the firms will receive 50%  credit, and will receive 25% credit during the third year if starting a new contract.     Prime  contractors  must  still  utilize  good  faith  efforts  to  achieve  the  goals  stated  for  their  contract.    Where  a  prime  contractor  submits  a compliance plan for  a City  project  utilizing an  Established  Business,  the  percentage  of  compliance  will be counted at the same level throughout the life of that contract.  For example, if an Established Business is entitled to  have its participation counted at the 75% level at the start of a contract, then, for the duration of that particular contract,  that  vendor’s  participation  would  be  counted  at  75%  for  purposes  of  applying  MBW/WBE  credit  for  that  contract.   Accordingly, for each new or subsequent contract, the percentage applied throughout the life of the contract would be that  allowed  by  the  ordinance  as  of  the  date  the  contract  is  awarded.  Similarly,  if  a  certified  MBE  or  WBE  becomes  an  Established  Business  subsequent  to  award  of  the  contract,  the  firm  will  be  counted  as  if  it  were  still  a  certified  MBE  or  WBE for that contract.  Further, if the Established Business is added to an existing contract after award, its participation  would be counted  based on the  amount allowed  as  of  the  date the business  is  added to  that contract, not  the  date the  contract was originally awarded.     Prime contractors are required to accurately indicate the correct percentage reduction per dollar committed to Established  Businesses  as  part  of  the  prime’s  compliance  plan  on  the  Schedule  D  forms  submitted  with  any  bid  or  proposal.   Established  Businesses  are  required  to  accurately  indicate  the  correct  percentage  reduction  per  dollar  committed  to  on  any Schedule C submitted to a prime contractor for submittal with a bid or proposal.     The contract compliance officer must, for a period of three years follwing a firm becoming an Established Business and no  less than 30 days prior to the anniversary date of a firm becoming an Established Business, issue a letter informing the                             Mayor Rahm Emanuel              City of Chicago                  Established Business Graduation Phase-Out Program      Policy Statement                                      firm  of  its  status  as  an  Established  Business  and  informing  it  of  the  percentage  of  credit  it  is  eligible  to  receive  for  the  coming year.     C. Communication.  DPS, and most particularly its compliance section, will need to communicate consistently and    effectively with the operational departments in the City in order to assist them in reviewing the compliance plans for their  contracts and assisting them in meeting their contract goals with the participation of Established Businesses.     III. The City’s Directory of MBE and WBE Firms   Pursuant  to  Section  2-92-490(d)  of  the  Code,  DPS  maintains  an  electronic  directory  of  certified  C.E.B.s  describing  the  firms  by  name, business  address,  classification  and type  of  business.    As  amended  by  the  ordinance  implementing  the  new  Section  2-92-470,  this  directory  will  now  include  participating  Established  Businesses,  i.e.,  those  Established  Businesses that remain eligible to receive partial credit for participation in the City’s MBE/WBE program.      IV. Applicability to Firms That Became Established Businesses Prior to Passage of the Ordinance    The  ordinance  applies  retroactively  to  businesses  that  became  established  in  calendar  year  2011.    All  businesses  that  became Established Businesses in 2011 are  eligible to receive credit applied  as follows: using the date of becoming an  Established  Business  as  a  starting  point,  for  the  firm’s  first  year  as  an  Established  Business,  the  firm  will  receive  75%  credit for participation in City contracts, i.e., for each dollar ($1.00) paid to such firms, the prime contractor will be credited  for  seventy-five  cents  ($0.75)  of  participation.    For  the  second  year,  as  determined  by  the  anniversary  date  of  the  firm  becoming an Established Business, the firm will receive 50% credit, and  will receive 25% credit during the  third  year as  determined by the anniversary date of the firm becoming an Established Business .      V.  Diversity Credit Program    Established Businesses will remain eligible for participation in the MBE/WBE program  through the City’s Diversity Credit  Program for the same period of time and at the same levels of credit granted for work performed directly on City projects,  which  credit  is  further  reduced  to  one  dollar  for  every  three  spent,  as  required  by  City  ordinance.    For  example, for  the  firm’s first year as an Established Business, the Prime contractors are eligible to receive twenty-five cents ($0.25) of credit  for every  dollar earned by  the  Established  Business.  (This is calculated as follows: For each dollar ($1.00) paid to such  firms, the prime contractor will be credited for thirty-three cents ($0.33), pursuant to the Diversity Credit ordinance.  That  amount is then further reduced by twenty-five percent for a total of twenty five cents ($0.25) of participation.).  In the firm’s  second  year  as  an  Established Business,  Prime contractors  are  eligible to receive seventeen cents  ($0.17)  of  credit  for  every dollar earned by the Established Business. (This is calculated as follows: For each dollar ($1.00) paid to such firms,  the prime contractor will be credited for thirty-three cents ($0.33), pursuant to the Diversity Credit ordinance.  That amount  is then further reduced by fifty percent for a total of eighteen cents ($0.18) of participation.).   In the firm’s third year as an  Established Business, Prime contractors are eligible to receive eight cents ($0.08) of credit for every dollar earned by the  Established Business. (This is calculated as follows: For each dollar ($1.00) paid to such firms, the prime contractor will  be credited for thirty-three cents ($0.33), pursuant to the Diversity Credit ordinance.  That amount is then further reduced  by seventy-five percent for a total of eight cents ($0.08) of participation.                                                               Mayor Rahm Emanuel              City of Chicago                  Established Business Graduation Phase-Out Program      Policy Statement                                      Rev. 07/2013                             Mayor Rahm Emanuel              City of Chicago                  Established Business Graduation Phase-Out Program      Policy Statement

This is, overall, 96% of all employees and elected officials scheduled to complete annual ethics training by year’s end.  On November 22, letters were sent to training administrators and department heads of each of the departments that are not yet 100% compliant, with lists of their employees who have yet to complete their training.  On December 12, a list of departments with outstanding employees left to complete the training was sent to the Mayor’s Office.  Staff is working closely with these departments to ensure that all of their employees complete the training by year’s end.   Staff held 9 sessions here in our offices for approximately 35 employees, who completed the training via video. These sessions were held on December 4, 11 and 18–3 each day.  Staff will again hold 2 sessions next week.  Emails were sent Monday to each department and training administrator informing them of these sessions and how to register their employees for them.  C.

Any person who owns, leases, rents, operates, manages, or in any  way  controls  a  public  accommodation  has  an  affirmative  duty  to  maintain  the  facility  free  of  harassment on the basis of membership in a protected class.      Harassment in a public accommodation is defined as slurs and other verbal or physical conduct  relating  to  an  individual’s  membership  in  a  protected  class,  when  that  conduct:  (1)  has  the  purpose  or  effect  of  creating  an  intimidating,  hostile  or  offensive  environment;  (2)  has  the  purpose  or  effect  of  unreasonably  interfering  with  an  individual’s  full  use  of  the  public  accommodation;  or  (3)  otherwise  adversely  affects  an  individual’s  full  use  of  the  public  accommodation.

The  Commission  investigates  and  rules  on  each  discrimination complaint through a neutral process which gives complainants and respondents  the opportunity to present evidence and legal arguments to support their positions.                                             Marital Status  Parental Status  Source of Income  Military Status  Credit History (employment only)                                 If someone files a discrimination complaint against you under Chicago’s ordinances, you will be  notified by mail and given an opportunity to present your defenses.  The Commission follows  specific legal rules and procedures for deciding whether discrimination has occurred, which may  include an administrative hearing before a neutral hearing officer.   Penalties for violations of the Human Rights Ordinance include—   -     Fines of $100 to $1,000 per incident, paid to the City.  -     Damages and attorney’s fees, paid to the complaining party.  -     An injunction ordering specific actions to eliminate discriminatory practices.

The prohibition contained  in this section shall not apply to the following:  (a)  a  private  club  or  other  establishment  not  in  fact  open  to  the  public,  except  to  the  extent  that  the  products, facilities or services thereof are made available to the general public or to the customers or  patrons of another establishment that is a public accommodation;   (b)  any facility, as to discrimination based on sex, which is distinctly private in nature, such as restrooms,      shower rooms, bathhouses, dressing rooms, and health clubs;….   (e)  …any person may use a public accommodation or any of its products, facilities or services that are  open to persons of his or her sex.   For purposes of this subsection, “sex” includes both biological  category and gender identity.

In May, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 2,847 feet of new 8- inch water main in N. Lavergne Avenue (Thomas-Superior) and in W. Cortez Street (Lavergne- Lamon). The old water main dates back to 1894, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    37th Ward Office: 773-379-0960    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

Currently, the risk of influenza infection in the Chicago area is low.  At the national level, CDC has reported a low percentage of  specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza.  The majority have been seasonal influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B viruses.   Although few viruses have been available for testing at CDC,  isolates that have been tested remain susceptible to the antiviral  drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).  Vaccination is the best way to protect against human seasonal influenza  infection and all Chicagoans aged six months and older are encouraged to get vaccinated. Chicagoans should ask their healthcare  provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  Uninsured individuals and those with insurance that does not cover flu shots  can obtain a voucher for a free flu shot at Walgreens by submitting a request at www.citychicago.org/health and clicking on Free  Walgreens Flu Vaccine Vouchers1 in the Alerts Section.  The Chicago Department of Public Health continues to hold influenza  vaccination clinics throughout the city.  A complete schedule of City of Chicago influenza vaccine clinics2 is available on the  City website and by calling 311.   Figure 1.

Weekly reported percent of outpatient clinic visits  attributed to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current  season (2011-2012) and previous season (Chicago and Illinois),  October-May.     Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   No influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were re- ported for week 46 (November 13-19, 2011).  Suspected  novel influenza, pediatric influenza-associated deaths and  influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations should all be  reported to CDPH via INEDSS3.  Outbreaks of influenza- like illness in a congregate setting are also reportable; in  Chicago these reports can be made by phone to (312) 746 -5911.  To date,  no cases meeting the reporting criteria  have been reported to CDPH.         How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   For the week of November 13-19, 2011, with 12 hospi- tals reporting, 2.4% of emergency room visits were due  to ILI (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with cough or sore  throat) (Figure 1).  Several outpatient clinics throughout  Chicago participate in the Influenza-like Illness Network  (ILINet) by reporting the percentage of clinic visits due  to ILI.  From November 13-19, 2011, with 16 outpatient  clinics reporting, 1.8% of outpatient clinic visits were due  to ILI.  This is similar to levels reported during the same  surveillance week in 2010 (Figure 2).       Which influenza strains are circulating?   Data on influenza virus test results are reported by Chi- cago laboratories performing influenza subtyping. For  the week of November 13-19, 2011, with 3 laboratories  reporting, none of the 83 specimens tested for influenza  were positive.  Since October 2011, less than one percent  of the total 854 specimens tested for influenza have been  positive.      Where can I get more information?   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s       FluView4 report provides national updates and trends  related to the intensity of influenza activity across the  United States, as well as detailed information on antivi- ral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics. Up- dates specific to Illinois5 and Suburban Cook County6 are    also available online.    1http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/flu/alerts/2011/nov/free_walgreens_fluvaccinevouchers.html;2http:// www.cityofchicago.org/content/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/flu/svcs/_cdph_flu_shot_sitesacrosschicago.html;3https://dph.partner.illinois.gov/; 4http:// www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm;5http://www.idph.state.il.us/flu/surveillance.htm;6http://www.cookcountypublichealth.org/data-reports#Influenza

Since the last Board meeting, we have held 2 classes in our offices, on August 14 and 28.  17  persons attended.  There are 19 participants scheduled for September 11 and 22 for  September 25.   On August 22, staff made a 60 minute presentation to a visiting delegation of 4 public  officials from the municipal government of the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, at the  request of the Mayor’s Office.   On September 23, staff will conduct a class for 24 members and directors of HACIA (the  Hispanic American Construction Industry Association), focusing on campaign contributions,  at the request of HACIA’s  Executive Director.

Four (4)  aldermen have completed the (separate aldermanic) program.  The 2014-2015 lobbyist  program is currently being written.    As of today, there are 615 registered lobbyists, and we have collected $335,635.00 in 2014  registration fees.  Reminders of the October 20 filing deadline for third quarter activity  reports will be sent to all lobbyists on September 30.    Since the August 2014 meeting, the agency issued 417 confidential advisory opinions.  The  leading categories were business travel, political activity, gifts, and campaign financing, and  post-employment.   Staff continues to work with the Department of Innovation & Technology on a “beta”  version of a secure, searchable database for all such informal advisory opinions.  This will  enable Board staff to receive instantaneous reports of opinions issued by topic, department,  title, date, etc.      The City has been phasing out all mainframe applications for years.  We still have one  program that resides on the mainframe, for mandatory quadrennial face-to-face ethics  education.  We are meeting later this week with the senior programmers in the Department  of Innovation and Technology to discuss migrating that program to a more contemporary  format with contemporary web architecture.    Since the last regularly scheduled Board meeting, the office has received one new request  under the Freedom of Information Act. It was for one alderman’s statements of financial  interests, other disclosures, and any complaints filed against the alderman. For the first  part, we sent those statements of financial interests we had and provided the link to the City  Clerk’s website, where the other requested statements are posted. For the second part, we  asked the requestor to clarify and narrow the request so we could respond accurately. For  the third part we advised that the law prohibits us from turning over complaints.         OLD BUSINESS   Freedom of Information Act   Mainframe Application   E.   F.        IV.

In addition, The Board voted to adjourn into Executive Session under 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(4) to hear and  discuss evidence or testimony in closed hearing as specifically authorized pursuant to Governmental Ethics  Ordinance Section 2-156-395 (the Ordinance applicable to this matter) and the Board’s Rules and  Regulations, 4A-2, “Hearings on Complaints Against Aldermen” as amended, effective February 26, 2010,  presented to a quasi-adjudicative body, as defined in the Illinois Open Meetings, provided that the body  prepares and makes available for public inspection a written decision setting forth its determinative  reasoning.    At 4:45 p.m., the Board VOTED 6-0 to reconvene into open session.   The Board confirmed it had approved the Executive Session minutes of the August 20, 2014  meeting by a 6-0 VOTE in executive session.    1.  Case No. 12035.OLIG, Consideration of Probable Cause [2012OLIG0007]   The Board VOTED 4-2 to make a finding of “no probable cause,” dismiss and close  the matter. The Board voted after it considered the Office of Legislative Inspector  General’s request, pursuant to its Confidential Closing Report, for a finding of  probable cause under §§2-156-385(1) and (3) of the Governmental Ethics  Ordinance. The Board found that the evidence in the Report did not show that there  was probable cause to believe that an alderman and/or two staff members had  violated any provision of the Ordinance. The complaint alleged improper  termination of an aldermanic employee, use of City property for political purposes,  violation of fiduciary duty for failure to obtain proper permits to renovate an  aldermanic office, and improper hiring of the alderman’s relative.   2.

Advisory Opinion   The Board deferred its consideration of these cases because the Office of Legislative  Inspector General failed to provide required notice to subjects, and the subjects did  not waive that failure.     Case No. 14034.A, Reverse Revolving Door  5.   The Board VOTED 6-0 to approve the draft advisory opinion determining that an  incoming City employee is subject to the Ordinance’s two year “reverse revolving  door” prohibition from acting in a decision-making capacity with respect to the City  employee’s immediate prior employer. Also, effective after the date of the City  employee’s hire, the prior employer will merge with another corporation. As a  result, the prior employer will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the other  corporation. The Board also determined that, if the merger occurs, then the newly- hired City employee will not be prohibited from acting in a decision-making capacity  as to the parent corporation; provided, however, that the City employee may not  work on or make decisions with respect to the parent’s existing or new City  contracts or projects if the subsidiary (the City employee’s prior employee) has had  or will have any participation or involvement in those contracts or projects.  6.    Case No. 14033.C, No Jurisdiction     The Board heard status report on this case.     The Board reviewed the pending case list.

Sedgwick, Suite 400, Chicago, IL 60654        Phone 312/744-4111, Fax 312/744-1081, TTY 312/744-1088  www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations        GENDER IDENTITY DISCRIMINATION   (in Public Accommodations, effective June 22, 2016)   Discriminatory conduct may also violate state or federal laws.  A finding of discrimination may affect the  continued licensure of a business by the City of Chicago as well as City contractor or vendor status.    A person who claims to have been subjected to discriminatory treatment based on gender identity may file  a discrimination complaint at the Commission on Human Relations.  The Commission may also initiate a  complaint.  The Commission investigates and rules on each discrimination complaint through a neutral  process  which  gives  complainants  and  respondents  the  opportunity  to  present  evidence  and  legal  arguments to support their positions.   See the back of this flyer for selected ordinance and regulation provisions.  For more information, see  www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations.   The  Chicago  Human  Rights  Ordinance  now  prohibits  public  accommodations  from  requiring  patrons  to  show  government  issued  identification  upon  request  to  access  facilities  that  are  private in nature based on a person's biological category, his or her gender identity, or both.   Gender identity is defined as the actual or perceived appearance, expression, identity, or behavior of a  person as being male or female—whether or not it is different from what is traditionally associated with  the person’s designated sex at birth.   Facilities  considered  private  in  nature  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  changing rooms.   Business operators and staff must allow individuals to choose the restroom or private facility of their  choice without being asked to present identification or otherwise prove their gender.    Business  operators and staff may not  question a person about gender identity  in ways that are not  legitimate or reasonable.   Business operators may be held liable for discriminatory conduct of their employees.    Penalties for violations of the Human Rights or Fair Housing Ordinance include—   -     Fines of $100 to $1,000 per incident, paid to the City.  -     Damages and attorney fees, paid to the complaining party.  -     An injunction ordering specific actions to eliminate discriminatory practices.               SELECTED LEGAL PROVISIONS ON GENDER IDENTITY DISCRIMINATION     Section 2-160-020(f), Chicago Municipal Code (Human Rights Ordinance)  Definition of Gender Identity  “Gender identity” means the actual or perceived appearance, expression, identity or behavior, of a person as being  male or female, whether or not that appearance, expression, identity or behavior is different from that traditionally  associated with the person’s designated sex at birth.    Section 2-160-070, Chicago Municipal Code (Human Rights Ordinance)  Discriminatory Practices in Public Accommodations  No person that owns, leases, rents, operates, manages or in any manner controls a public accommodation  shall withhold, deny, curtail, limit or discriminate concerning the full use of such public accommodation  by any individual because of the individual’s race, color, sex, gender identity, age, religion, disability,  national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, military status, credit history  (employment only), criminal history (employment only), or source of income.  The prohibition contained  in this section shall not apply to the following:  (a)  a  private  club  or  other  establishment  not  in  fact  open  to  the  public,  except  to  the  extent  that  the  products, facilities or services thereof are made available to the general public or to the customers or  patrons of another establishment that is a public accommodation;   (b)  any facility, as to discrimination based on sex, which is distinctly private in nature, such as restrooms,   shower rooms, bathhouses, dressing rooms, and health clubs;….   (e)  …any person may use a public accommodation or any of its products, facilities or services that are  open to persons of his or her sex.   For purposes of this subsection, “sex” includes both biological  category and gender identity.  Each person determines his or her own gender identity; no proof shall  be required except his or her expression of his or her gender.     CCHR Reg. 520.100  Discriminatory Conduct in Public Accommodations  ….Discriminatory acts include, but are  not limited to: denying admittance to persons in a Protected Class; using  different terms for admittance of persons in a Protected Class; harassing persons in a Protected Class (whether or not  allowed admittance); and failing to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability.    CCHR Reg. 520.150  Harassment in Public Accommodations  (a)  Harassment on the basis of actual or perceived membership in a Protected Class…is a violation of the HRO.   Any person who owns, leases, rents, operates, manages or in any manner controls a public accommodation has  an  affirmative  duty  to  maintain  a  public  accommodation  environment  free  of  harassment  on  the  basis  of  membership in a Protected Class.   (b)  Slurs  and  other  verbal  or  physical  conduct  relating  to  an  individual’s  membership  in  a  Protected  Class…constitutes  harassment  when  the  conduct:  (i)  has  the  purpose  or  effect  of  creating  an  intimidating,  hostile or offensive environment; (ii) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s  full  use  of  the  public  accommodation;  (iii)  otherwise  adversely  affects  an  individual’s  full  use  of  the  public  accommodation.

RECITALS   The foregoing recitals are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference.   SECTION  2.   [intentionally omitted]   SECTION 3.  THE PROJECT   (a)  The parties acknowledge that the Project shall begin in 2012 and shall be  completed   not later than December 31,  2014.   (b)  The CTA shall provide the City any plans and specifications pertaining to the Project   that the City may reasonably request from time to time during the Term of this Agreement, and  shall notify HED of any significant changes to said plans.   (c)  The CTA hereby certifies that the Project has to date and shall continue to comply  with all applicable federal,  state and  local laws,  statutes,  ordinances, rules,  regulations, codes  and executive orders as may be in  effect at the time of the Project's completion.   (d)  The CTA hereby certifies to the City that the City Funds shall be sufficient to   complete the Project.   SECTION 4.  FINANCING   (a)  City Funds shall be  used to pay the CTA for its incurred costs of TIF-Eiigible   Improvements, contingent upon receipt by the City of documentation satisfactory in form and  substance to HED evidencing such costs.  ""TIF-Eiigible Improvements"" means those  improvements of the Project which (i) qualify as Redevelopment Project Costs as defined in the  Act,  (ii) are eligible costs under the Amended Plan, and  (iii) the City has agreed to pay for out of  the City Funds, subject to the terms of this Agreement.  The City agrees that Exhibit A hereto   -2-  represents certain TIF-Eiigible Improvements for the Project and sets forth,  by approximate line  item amounts, the minimum amount of TIF-Eiigible Improvements the CTA plans for the Project.  The CTA may implement changes to the Project that cause variations in the line item amounts  shown on  Exhibit A,  provided that all the changes qualify as TIF-Eiigible Improvements.   (b)  Subject to the terms and  conditions of this Agreement, the City shall  pay to the CTA   an  amount not to exceed $10,000,000 in  City Funds from Available Incremental Taxes to pay  the Project Costs.  If the actual Project Costs total less than  $10,000,000, then the maximum  the City shall be  liable for under this Agreement is  100% of those Project Costs that constitute  TIF-Eiigible Improvements.  If the actual Project Costs exceed $10,000,000, then the CTA shall  be solely responsible for such excess costs.   (c)  ""Available Incremental Taxes"" means such taxes which,  pursuant to the TIF   Adoption Ordinance and Section 5/11-74.4-S(b) of the Act,  are allocated to and when collected  are paid to the Treasurer of the City of Chicago for deposit by the Treasurer into the Near South  TIF Fund established to pay Redevelopment Project Costs and obligations incurred in the  payment thereof,  and which are not encumbered or pledged for the payment of Prior  Obligations.   (d)  The City warrants that it has available and has segregated on the books of the City  an  amount of City Funds sufficient to pay the Project Costs,  and covenants that the City Funds  will  not be  used for any purpose other than the Project Costs during the Term of this Agreement.   (e)  The City Funds being provided hereunder are being granted on a conditional  basis,   subject to the CTA's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.   SECTION 5.  PAYMENT of CITY FUNDS   (a)  The CTA shall  prepare and provide to HED,  on  a quarterly basis,  in advance,  the   estimated amounts of City Funds that will  be required to pay the costs of the Project during the  next succeeding ninety (90) days (""Request for Payment""). Requests for Payment shall consist  solely of likely expenditures that qualify as TIF-Eiigible Improvements,  such as design and  planning fees and rehabilitation construction costs.  Within thirty (30) days following  receipt of a  quarterly estimate and Request for Payment,  HED shall process the Request for Payment and  remit payment of City Funds to the CTA, which payment shall consist of the estimated amounts  required for payment of the qualified costs of the Project during the next succeeding ninety (90)  day period as such amounts may be  adjusted from time to time by mutual agreement of the  parties.  In the event that City Funds have not been paid to the CTA within thirty (30) days  following the receipt of such Request for Payment, the CTA shall have the right to suspend its  performance under this Agreement until  payment is received.   (b)  The CTA will deposit such funds in  a segregated sub-account it controls and will  use   such funds to pay TIF-Eiigible Improvements costs of the Project from time to time.  The CTA  shall provide the City with a cash flow analysis of the segregated sub-account for the Project  upon request.   (c)  Any balance remaining in the segregated sub-account 90 days after the date of final   completion of the Project shall be promptly repaid to the City upon demand of HED.   (d)  Once per quarter, the CTA shall submit documentation to HED substantiating its   -3-  applicable incurrence and payment, during the prior 90 days,  of Redevelopment Project Costs  (including TIF-Eiigible Improvements). In addition to the items expressly set forth therein, such  documentation shall constitute a certification to the City that:   (i) the costs represent the actual amount already incurred by the CTA for its own  work or incurred by the CTA by its general contractor(s),  subcontractors or other  parties who have performed work on  or otherwise provided goods or services in  connection with the Project for the CT A;   (ii) the CTA has approved all work and materials for the  Project reflected in the  report;  and   (iii) the work was performed in  accordance with  all applicable federal,  state and  local laws,  statutes, ordinances, rules,  regulations, codes and executive orders at  the time of its completion.   HED shall review each report for,  among other things, evidence that the CTA incurred and  paid  TIF-Eiigible Expenditures in  an  amo.unt that equals or exceeds the amount of City Funds that  had been pre-paid to the CTA prior to that time,  and  HED shall inform the CTA of any questions  or comments about same as soon as practicable.   SECTION 6.  TERM   The term of this Agreement (""Term"") shall commence on the Closing Date and shall   expire on  December 31,  2014 or on the date of termination of this Agreement according to its  terms, whichever occurs first.   SECTION 7.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS; SAFETY; INSPECTION   (a)  The City makes no covenant,  representation or warranty as to the environmental   condition of the Project or the suitability of the Project for any public rapid transit use  whatsoever.   (b)  The CTA shall be solely responsible for the safety and protection of the public in   connection with the Project.   (c)  The City reserves the right to inspect the Project from time to time as it is being   undertaken or after its completion.   SECTION 8.  INSURANCE   (a)  The CTA is  self-insured.  During the term of this Agreement, the CTA shall provide  and maintain,  at the CTA's own expense,  or cause to be provided,  insurance or self-insurance  equivalent to the coverages and requirements specified below concerning all operations related  to this Agreement.   (b)  Workers Compensation and  Employers Liability.  Workers Compensation as   prescribed by applicable law covering all employees who are to provide a service under this  Agreement and Employers Liability coverage with limits of not less than $100,000 each accident  or illness.   -4-  (c)  Commercial General Liability (Primary and  Umbrella).  Commercial General Liability  Insurance or equivalent self-insurance with limits of not less than $1 ,000,000 per occurrence for  bodily injury,  personal injury,  and property damage liability.  Coverages shall include the  following: All premises and operations,  products/completed operations, explosion,  collapse,  underground, separation of insureds, defense, and contractual liability. The City of Chicago will  be considered an  additional insured on a primary,  non-contributory basis for any liability arising  directly from the work.  For those contracts already let or for work already performed prior to the  Closing Date, the CTA shall  recognize the City of Chicago as an  additional insured on a  primary,  non-contributory basis for any liability arising directly from such work.   (d)  Automobile Liability (Primary and  Umbrella).  When any motor vehicles (owned,  non(cid:173) owned and hired) are used in  connection with work to be performed, the CTA shall provide self(cid:173) insured Automobile Liability coverage with  limits of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence for  bodily injury and property damage.   (e)  Professional Liability.  When any architects,  engineers or professional consultants   engaged by the CTA perform work in connection with this Agreement, the CTA shall provide  self-insured Professional Liability covering acts,  errors,  or omissions with limits of not less than  $1 ,000,000.   (f)  Prior to the Closing Date, the CTA will furnish the City a letter of self insurance   evidencing the required coverage to be in force on the Closing Date.  After the Closing Date, the  CTA will furnish the City similar evidence if the coverages change from  self-insurance to  purchased insurance during the term of this Agreement and prior to the completion of the  Project.  The receipt of any self-insurance does not constitute agreement by the City that the  insurance requirements in this Agreement have been fully met or that the self-insurance is in  compliance with all Agreement requirements.   (g)  Non-conforming self-insurance shall  not relieve the CTA of the obligation to provide   or cause to be provided insurance as specified herein.  Nonfulfillment of the  insurance  conditions may constitute a violation of this Agreement,  and the City retains the right to stop the  CTA's work until proper evidence of insurance is provided,  or this Agreement may be  terminated.   (h)  The required general liability self-insurance shall provide for sixty (60) days prior   written notice to be given to the City or the CTA in the event coverage is substantially changed,  canceled,  or non-renewed.

Diversey Parkway, and in W. Diversey Parkway, from N. Mildred Avenue  to N. Halsted Street.    Reason:  The old sewer main dates back to 1885 and needs replacement. The area bounded by  Wolfram Street on the north, the alley south of Diversey Parkway on the south, Halsted Street on  the east, and the alley went of Mildred Avenue on the west will benefit from improved drainage  and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work starts shortly, and we expect their job to be completed in late September.  Restoration will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is  any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:   To perform the sewer installation in Diversey, the following detour plans will be  implemented:    Stage I:  From July 7, 2014 to August 2, 2014  Westbound  traffic  on  W.  Diversey  Parkway  will  be  detoured  for  four  (4)  weeks  from  Halsted  south  to  Fullerton  to  Sheffield  and  back  to  Diversey.  Eastbound  traffic  on  Diversey  will  be  maintained at all times. The contractor will provide and maintain access for local and emergency  vehicles during the construction period.    Stage II:  From August 3, 2014 to August 16, 2014.  To finish the sewer work at the intersection of Halsted and Diversey, southbound Halsted will be  detoured  from  Belmont  to  Sheffield  and  south  to  Diversey.  Northbound  traffic  on  Halsted  and  eastbound  traffic  on  Diversey  will  be  maintained  at  all  times.  The  contractor  will  provide  and  maintain access for local and emergency vehicles during the construction period.    Otherwise, we will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 5pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.       CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN THOMAS TUNNEY   773-525-6034      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029             FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS           Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Tunney, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

By late March 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 5,086 feet of new 8-inch water main in E. 93rd Street,  from S. Jeffery Avenue to S. Colfax Avenue and S. Clyde Avenue, from E. 92nd Street to E. 93rd Street.  The old water main dates back to 1895, and needs to be replaced.   If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  8th Ward Office: 773-874-3300  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635              2                                         1       Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.        If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.
