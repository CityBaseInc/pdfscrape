By late February 2016, the Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark  Construction Company crews will begin the work to install 625 feet of new 8-inch and  1,031 feet of new 12-inch water main in S. Throop Street, from W. 31st Street to W. 32nd  Place and W. 32nd Place, from S. Throop Street to S. Racine Avenue. The old water main  dates back to 1878, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to www.buildinganewchicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply  enter your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this  letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.      Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  11th Ward Office: 773-254-6677  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for several  minutes.  The aerator screens located at the tip of your faucets should be removed prior to  flushing.    This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, or any  particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line as a result of  the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.   Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner

Western Ave.    June 2017      June is National Pet Preparedness Month: Are You Prepared?    Tornadoes. Storms. Floods. These and other natural and unnatural  disasters can require a swift exit from the home. Are you and your pet  prepared for an emergency?  Planning ahead—and having a plan—is  essential. Here are a few tips to ensure that your pet remains safe.    1.  Research nearby hotels and motels that permit pets and check with  nearby family members to see if they are willing to board your pet in  case of emergency.    2.  Keep a well-stocked emergency toolkit containing first aid supplies; a   leash and/or carrier; medications your pet needs; a copy of your  pet’s medical records; and pet food, water, and bowls.   3.  To aid emergency responders, place a sticker on your home’s   windows and doors that indicates how many pets are inside your  house.    Additionally, in the event anything should happen to you, have a clear plan  for your pet, including a care-giver arrangement. Be sure to tell your family  of your wishes for your pet.     Check out these helpful sites containing more information and tips:     The Humane Society of the United States   www.humanesociety.org/issues/animal_rescue/tips/pets-disaster.html       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   www.cdc.gov/features/petsanddisasters/       The Federal Emergency Management Agency   www.ready.gov/animals        Join Us Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:30 for the Grand Opening of  CACC’s Renovated Facility!

Western Ave.             Too often pets that have bitten or scratched people or other animals end up at  CACC for a 10-day rabies observation because their owners did not get them  vaccinated. If the pet had its rabies shot and CACC did not have to impound him,  the pet could have been observed the 1st and 10th day at the veterinarian’s office.  Vaccinating for rabies doesn’t just protect those who do the biting, it protects the  bitten as well. It’s also the law. All animals that receive rabies vaccinations are  issued a rabies tag, which also serves as identification that can reunite lost pets  with their owners. CACC has a low-cost vaccine clinic the third Wednesday of each  month. The next one is 6/21 at 9 a.m. Cook County Animal and Rabies Control also  offers a number of low-cost vaccine clinics in 2017, visit  www.cookcountyil.gov/service/low-cost-rabies-clinic to learn more!                     Adopt  Don’t Shop! *Adoption Fee Only $65* includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, collar, tag and leash!                  BOOMER (A162696) has lots of  energy and is learning how to  chase balls (next class is  “bringing them back”!). He  might be part hound, because  he loves to sniff and sniff!  Boomer also attends our dog  playgroup where he likes to get  in some good chasing and  rowdy play! If you are active  and want a hiking partner, two- year-old Boomer would be a  good dog for you!                     PERSEPHONE (A162880) is a  wonderful lap dog! She LOVES  people and is very affectionate.  At three-years-old she has a  nice even energy level, too. This  discerning girl loves people  more than dogs, so we  recommend that she be your  one and only!      BILLY (A163571) loves to go to  playgroup where he helps the  team test and learn about new  dogs. He has been described as  a “nice social dude.” Two-year- old Billy is a big puppy with lots  of energy and doesn’t know any  commands (yet!) but he is food  motivated and eager to please  which will help with his  training.        Squeak! This is the cute noise  that ALI (A164487) makes to  call people over to rub her big  soft belly! This affectionate cat  is as sweet as can be. She  arrived at the shelter as a stray,  so we don’t know much about  her past, but we know this  charming, sleek kitty has a  bright future ahead!       Poor SAMANTHA (A164756)  was confiscated from a home  after her person died, so she is  understandably sad. But this  adorable two-year-old cat also  seems curious about her  surroundings and loves meeting  new people. We know she’ll be  so grateful and loving with a  new family. Please give her the  second chance she deserves!          Two-year-old BORIS  (A164904) and nine-year-old  SPENCER (A164905) found  themselves in the shelter after  their former guardian had to  move and couldn’t take them.  These bonded boys are best of  friends, and a couple of cool  cats. We’d love to find someone  who appreciates their strong  bond and wants to bring home  the good vibes these guys will  add to their new household!

La  Salle   Chicago,  IL 60602   Re:   Case No. 05025.Q   Dear Alderman   This  letter  confirms  the  advice  given  orally  to  your  office  earlier  today  regarding  ownership  of  common  stock  of  [A  Co.]  .  As  provided  in  §§  2-156-010  U),  (I)  and  -080(b)(2)(ii)  of  the  City's  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance,  a City employee or official would  not have an  economic interest  in,  financial  interest  in,  or  a  business  relationship  with,  [A  Co.]  (or  any  company whose  shares  are  registered  on  a  national  securities  exchange),  unless  that  employee's  or  official's  ownership  of the  company's  common  shares  is  one  percent  or  more  of that  company's  shares-that  is  the  case  regardless  of the  value  of the  shares  or  of dividends  on  such  shares.  If  that City employee or official  does  not have  an  economic interest,  financial  interest or business relationship  in  or with  [A Co.]  (or any company whose  shares  are  registered  on  a  national  securities  exchange),  then  that  City  employee  or official would  not  be  subject to  the  prohibitions  in  the  sections  of the  Ordinance cited  above with  respect to  matters involving  [A  Co.]  (or  any other such company).   Our conclusion  in  this  matter is  based  solely on  the application  of the City's  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance to  the facts  described  in  this  letter.  If that  description  is  incorrect or incomplete,  please notify us  immediately,  as  any  change may alter our conclusion.   We  appreciate  your  inquiry  and  your  concern  to  abide  by  the  standards  embodied in the City's Governmental Ethics Ordinance.   Yours very truly,   Steven I.

Thus,  persons  who  do  not  fall  into  any  of the  above  categories  may,  under  this  section  of the  CFO,  make  campaign  contributions  in  any  amount  to  Aldermen  or  aldermanic  candidates  (they  are,  of  course,  subject to the restrictions imposed by  §§  2-164-020,  -030 and -040(b) and (c) of the CFO, but  these restrictions do  not~ se limit the amount of campaign contributions).   Additionally,  please  be  aware  that  §2-164-041  of the  CFO  provides  that  no  person  shall  make  any  cash  contribution  to  any  ""candidate""  (a  term  defined  in  §2-164-0lO(b))  in  an  amount  in  excess  of  $250.  The  Board of Ethics  has  held that the  term cash includes  cashier's  checks  and money orders.  See  Case  No.  97032.A  (enclosed).  Finally,  please  be  aware  that  in  Case  No.  90066.A  (enclosed),  the  Board  held  that  the  limit  on  contributions  to  aldermanic  candidates  per  reporting  year  from  persons  subject  to  the  limitations  in  § 2-164-040(a)  of the  CFO  is  $1,500,  even  if there  are  run-off   Case No.  99016.Q  March 11,  1999  Page 3   elections involving those candidates.  This is  true despite the sentence in  §  040(a)  which states  ""the  ...  effect of these provisions is intended to permit total contributions up to but not exceeding $3,000.00  in a reporting year in which a candidacy occurs.""  The Board reasoned that these aldermanic run-offs  are neither primary nor separate general elections.   For your convenience,  we  enclose copies  of the City's Governmental Ethics  and Campaign Financing  Ordinance,  in  which  we  have  highlighted  the  provisions  referred  to  in  this  letter.  We  also  remind  you  that  a list  of  lobbyists  currently  registered  with  the  Board  (as  well  as  complete  texts  of  both  Ordinances) can be found on our agency's page on the City's Mosaic on the Internet:   www. ci. chi.il. us/W orksMart/Ethics   We hope this  letter answers  the  questions  [your staff member]  expressed.  We appreciate the inquiry  and  your  exemplary  concern  to  abide  by  the  standards  embodied  in  the  City's  Governmental  Ethics  and Campaign Financing Ordinances.  Of course, please feel free to call us  if you need more specific  guidance.   Yours very truly,  SIGNED   Steven I. Berlin  Deputy Director   approved:  SIGNED   Dorothy J.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you, our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our private contractor will soon begin preliminary construction at 117th Street and Normal  Avenue. Following, our in-house crews will install a new sewer in Eggleston Avenue, from 116th  Street to 118th Street, and in 117th Street, from Normal Avenue to Stewart Avenue. The old sewer  dates back to 1899 and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Austin’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.    Sincerely,    Thomas Powers  Commissioner              cc: Alderman Carrie Austin         34th Ward                                1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            Do you wonder what was happening in 1899? That’s the year the old sewer main was  installed beneath your street. Among other things:           ALFRED HITCHCOCK        The pain reliever acetylsalicylic acid was named “aspirin” and sold by Bayer   around the world.     The first auto repair shop opened in Boston.    The Gideon Society was established to place Bibles in hotels.    Carnation processed its first can of evaporated milk.    Voting machines were approved by the U.S. Congress for use in federal elections.    The Bronx Zoo opened in New York.    Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock was born.                             PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  Our private contractor will soon begin preliminary construction at 117th Street and  Normal Avenue. Following, our in-house crews will install a new sewer in Eggleston Avenue,  from 116th Street to 118th Street, and in 117th Street, from Normal Avenue to Stewart Avenue.    Reason:  The old sewer main dates back to 1899 and needs replacement. The area bounded by  116th Street on the north, 118th Street on the south, Stewart on the east, and Normal on the west  will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Our contractor’s work starts shortly, and we expect their job to be completed in late  August. In-house construction is expected to start in late August, and expected to be completed  in late October. Restoration will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other  factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:   We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 5pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Austin, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

WATER PROJECT        PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,415 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. 101st Street, from S. Lowe Avenue to S. Eggleston Avenue.    Reason: The old main consist of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further old pipe  dates back to 1893 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the job to be  completed in late September 2015. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. 101st Street outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.     Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late September  2015. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If  there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
