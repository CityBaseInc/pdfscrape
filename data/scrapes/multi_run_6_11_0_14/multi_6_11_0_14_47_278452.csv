Starting in early February, the Department of Water Management’s crews will install a new  sewer main in W. Chase Avenue, from Clark to Paulina. The old sewer dates back to 1955  and needs to be replaced.     This project includes making a connection to the existing sewer at the intersection of Chase  and Clark and as such, the full and continuous closure and detour of Clark is required for a  few days. Otherwise, when we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety  reasons, but you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working  hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    49th Ward Office: 773-338-5796    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner

Employees of a business should limit   how much they handle, deliver, pour or store   the alcohol for the customer.   A business should obtain liability insurance to               protect against potential lawsuits. A business is allowed to provide  a glass and ice for the customer.

Jeśli masz grzejnik typu space heater lub myślisz o jego kupnie, Straż  Pożarna w Chicago podaje następujące informacje, istotne dla bezpieczeństwa.         BEZPIECZEŃSTWO I GRZEJNIKI   •  Upewnij się, że czujniki dymu i czadu działają.  •  Nigdy nie używaj sprzętu, spalającego jakiekolwiek paliwo, bez właściwej wentylacji. Palące się paliwo (np. nafta, węgiel,   •  Upewnij się, że grzejnik jest sprawny. Wszystkie grzejniki wymagają regularnych przeglądów i czyszczenia. Brudny lub   propan) wydziela trujące opary.   zaniedbany grzejnik może grozić pożarem.   •  Używaj właściwego dla danego grzejnika paliwa.   •  Nie przechowuj nafty, benzyny lub innych łatwopalnych płynów w domu.  •  Używaj właściwego pojemnika do przechowywania łatwopalnych płynów.  •  Grzejniki powinny znajdować się co najmniej 3 stopy od wszelkich łatwopalnych przedmiotów (np. ubrań, zasłon, łóżek) i   ścian.    •   •  Nigdy nie pozostawiaj dzieci bez opieki w pomieszczeniu z grzejnikiem typu space heater.  •  Nie pozwalaj małym dzieciom zbliżać się do grzejników, zwłaszcza, kiedy mają na sobie koszule nocne, które mogą być   wciągnięte do grzejnika i zapalić się.  Jeśli używasz grzejnika elektrycznego, upewnij się, że masz w domu właściwe przewody elektryczne. Nie przeładowuj  instalacji elektrycznej. Staraj się nie używać zwykłych przedłużaczy, tylko używaj takich, które mają korki.   Nigdy nie przekraczaj mocy gniazdka elektrycznego.      •  Nigdy nie przykrywaj dywanem lub meblem kabla do grzejnika. Kabel może się przegrzać i zapalić.  •  Staraj się nie używać elektrycznych grzejników w łazience. Nigdy nie dotykaj elektrycznego grzejnika, kiedy jesteś mokry.  •  Kiedy dolewasz nafty do grzejnika, staraj się nie przelać. Jeśli nafta jest zimna, rozszerzy się przy podgrzaniu i może zalać   grzejnik. To może spowodować płomienie.   •  Nigdy nie dolewaj nafty do palącego się grzejnika.  •  Wyłącz grzejnik lub zmniejsz ogrzewanie przed pójściem spać.  •  Kiedy używasz grzejnika na paliwo, otwórz okno, aby uzyskać odpowiednią wentylację.  •  Używaj tylko grzejników, które spełniają warunki bezpieczeństwa. Grzejniki te powinny mieć nalepki z U.I. lub A.G.A.   poświadczeniem.

WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 4,423 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Root Street, from S. Emerald Avenue to S. Princeton Avenue and S. Wallace  Street, from W. 41st Street to W. 43rd Street.    Reason: The old pipe dates back to 1906 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the job to be  completed in late November 2015. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Root Street and S. Wallace Street outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late November  2015. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!            "

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you,  our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     The Department of Water Management will soon install a new sewer in W. Huron Street, from  N. Cicero Avenue to N. Kenton Avenue, and in N. Kenton Avenue, from W. Ohio Street to W.  Superior Street. The old pipe dates back to 1914, and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Ervin’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Jason C.

That’s the year the old sewer main was  installed beneath your street. Among other things:       BABE RUTH             Fettuccini Alfredo was first created in 1914 by Alfred Di Lelio. The dish supposedly   helped restore the appetite of his wife after she gave birth to their son.     Baseball legend Babe Ruth made his major league debut with the Boston Red Sox.    The first ship passed through the Panama Canal.    W. H. Carrier patented the air conditioner.    Congress established Mother’s Day.    The first traffic light was installed, at the intersection of Euclid Avenue and East 105th     The U.S. Post Office began using automobiles to collect and deliver mail.   Street, in Cleveland.                                        PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing a new sewer in W.  Huron Street, from N. Cicero Avenue to N. Kenton Avenue, and in N. Kenton Avenue, from W.  Ohio Street to W. Superior Street.     Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1914 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by  Chicago Avenue on the north, Ohio Street on the south, Kenton Avenue on the east, and Cicero  Avenue on the west will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work begins shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in late November.  Restoration of the damaged streets/parkways will follow. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:  We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we may have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to  reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working  hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am-4pm,  M-F). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

ERVIN   773-533-0900   3-1-1            312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Ervin, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.             Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Weekly reported percent of emergency department visits  attributed to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current  season (2011-2012) and previous two seasons, October-May.   What is the risk?  Currently, the risk of influenza infection in the Chicago area is low.  At the national level, CDC confirmed this week two  human infections with novel influenza A viruses in individuals in Maine and Indiana.  These viruses were characterized  as swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) and both patients had close contact with pigs preceding their illness.  There is no  evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses.  Vaccination is the best way to protect against hu- man seasonal influenza infection and all Chicagoans aged six months and older are encouraged to get vaccinated. Chica- goans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  The City of Chicago will be offer- ing free flu shots on Saturday, November 5th at Arturo Velasquez Institute, Wright and Daley Colleges.  A com- plete schedule of City of Chicago influenza vaccine clinics1 is available on the City website and by calling 311.    Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   No influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were  reported for week 43 (October 23-29, 2011).  Sus- pected novel influenza, pediatric influenza-associated  deaths, influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations and  outbreaks of influenza-like illness in a congregate  setting should all be reported to CDPH via INEDSS2.         How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   For the week of October 23-29, 2011, with 16 hospi- tals reporting, 2.8% of emergency room visits were  due to ILI (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with cough  or sore throat). This is less than one percentage point  lower than levels reported during the same surveil- lance week in 2010 (Figure 1).  Several outpatient  clinics throughout Chicago participate in the Influ- enza-like Illness Network (ILINet) by reporting the  percentage of clinic visits due to ILI.  From October  23-29, 2011, with 17 outpatient clinics reporting,  2.0% of outpatient clinic visits were due to ILI.  This  is the second consecutive week that an increase has  been noted (Figure 2).       Which influenza strains are circulating?   Data on influenza virus test results are reported by  Chicago laboratories performing influenza subtyping.  For the week of October 23-29, 2011, with 4 labora- tories reporting, none of the 108 specimens tested for  influenza were positive.     Where can I get more information?   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s       FluView3 report provides national updates and trends  related to the intensity of influenza activity across the  United States, as well as detailed information on anti- viral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics.  Updates specific to Illinois4 and Suburban Cook  County5 are also available online.     1http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/influenza/cdph_flu_shot_sitesacrosschicago.html; 2https://dph.partner.illinois.gov/;  3http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm; 4http://www.idph.state.il.us/flu/surveillance.htm; 5http://www.cookcountypublichealth.org/data- reports#Influenza   Figure 2.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 588 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Keystone Avenue, from W.  North Avenue to W. LeMoyne Street. The old pipe dates back to 1893, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Reboyras’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Ariel Reboyras               30th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                  Do you wonder what was happening in 1893?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                  MAE WEST        The World’s Columbian Exposition opened in Chicago.    Henry Perky and William Ford patented shredded wheat.    The first bowling magazine, which was called Gut Holz, was published.    France issued the first driver’s licenses, which included a required test.    Katharine Lee Bates wrote ""America the Beautiful,"" in Colorado.    Lizzie Borden was acquitted in the murder of her parents in New Bedford,   Massachusetts.     New Zealand became the first country to grant all its women the right to vote.    Actress Mae West was born.                         WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 588 feet of 8-inch water  main in N. Keystone Avenue, from W. North Avenue to W. LeMoyne Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1893 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in June. Restoration will follow in July. Dates may change depending on weather and  other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN ARIEL REBOYRAS   773-794-3095      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE          312-742-1029                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in June. Restoration  will be completed in July. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!      "

In mid-November, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 3,956  feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Halmin Avenue (56th Street-58th Street) and in W. 57th Place  (Pulaski-Central Park). The old water main dates back to 1913, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise.
