Rule 8:  Disrespect to or maltreatment of any person, while on or off duty.    Rule 14:  Making a false report, written or oral.     On October 21, 2013, Officer Novalez filed with the Police Board a request for Police   Board review of this suspension. On October 28, 2013, Officer Novalez filed with the Police   Board a memorandum delineating specific reasons for which the review was requested. On   January 23, 2014, the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA) submitted a written response   to Officer Novalez’s memorandum.   The Executive Director of the Police Board assigned this matter to Hearing Officer   Thomas E. Johnson.  Hearing Officer Johnson reviewed the investigation file and submitted a   written report to the Police Board.     The members of the Police Board reviewed the Summary Report of the investigation file,   the Command Channel Review reports, Officer Novalez’s memorandum, IPRA’s response, and   Hearing Officer Johnson’s report.  Hearing Officer Johnson made an oral report to and conferred   with the Police Board before it rendered its findings and decision.   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2316  Police Officer Veronica Novalez  Findings and Decision                 POLICE BOARD FINDINGS   The Police Board of the City of Chicago, as a result of its consideration of this matter,   finds and determines that:   1.   There is insufficient evidence to either prove or disprove the allegation, set forth   below, that Police Officer Veronica Novalez, Star No. 19232, violated Rule 8, and the allegation   is therefore not sustained.   On October 29, 2006, at 0100 hours, at 1426 West Chestnut Street, Chicago, while off duty,  Officer Novalez engaged in a physical altercation with Vanessa Gonzalez.     Vanessa Gonzalez alleges that Officer Novalez (who was off duty) grabbed her and threw   her against a fence, then threw her on the ground and kneed her on the face during a fight at a   party. Officer Novalez denies these allegations. She maintains that her only involvement was to   guide a very drunk Gonzalez away from the fight that was going on at the party.    On the critical issue of whether Officer Novalez maltreated Gonzalez or was merely   trying to remove her from the middle of a chaotic situation, the evidence is not sufficient to   sustain the allegation against Officer Novalez for several reasons.   First, Gonzalez was definitely intoxicated at the time. The St. Mary Hospital records   show her blood alcohol level was .138. In addition, the hospital notes show that she smelled of   alcohol, had slurred speech and an unsteady gait. Her credibility is undermined, moreover, as she   testified at the criminal case she instigated against Angel Santana that she had consumed less   than one cup of cranberry juice and vodka at the party.   Second, Gonzalez’s boyfriend, Julian Ramirez, testified at Santana’s trial that he never   saw Novalez hit Gonzalez or cause Gonzalez any problems, even though he was at the scene   when Officer Novalez allegedly struck his girlfriend. Ramirez’s testimony is inconsistent with      2   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2316  Police Officer Veronica Novalez  Findings and Decision    the statement he gave IPRA, where he backed Gonzalez’s account.               Third, several witnesses (Jesus Padin, Benjamin Cruz, and Angel Santana) stated that   Gonzalez was an instigator of a fight at the party, that Gonzalez directed profanities at Novalez,   grabbed Novalez’s hair, and tried to strike Novalez, and that Novalez merely tried to restrain   Gonzalez.   Fourth, Gonzalez testified at the criminal trial that she suffered injuries from persons   other than Officer Novalez.   Given the various and conflicting accounts of the incident, the Board finds that there is   insufficient evidence to sustain the allegation that Officer Novalez physically maltreated   Gonzalez.      2.   There is insufficient evidence to either prove or disprove the allegation, set forth   below, that Police Officer Veronica Novalez, Star No. 19232, violated Rule 6, and the allegation   is therefore not sustained.   On October 29, 2006, at 0100 hours, at 1426 West Chestnut Street, Chicago, while off duty,  Officer Novalez failed to complete a Tactical Response Report (TRR) relative to this  incident, as required by General Order 02-08-05, Section II-A-1, which states a Tactical  Response Report will be used to document an incident which involves a subject fitting the  definition of an assailant whose actions are directed against a Department member or  directed against another person and the member intervenes.      See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 1 above, which are incorporated here by   reference.  Given the various and conflicting accounts of the incident, and the lack of any   directive from the responding sergeant to Officer Novalez that she should complete at TRR, the   Board finds that there is insufficient evidence to sustain the allegation that Officer Novalez   violated the General Order by not completing a TRR.      3   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2316  Police Officer Veronica Novalez  Findings and Decision                 3.   There is insufficient evidence to either prove or disprove the allegation, set forth   below, that Police Officer Veronica Novalez, Star No. 19232, violated Rule 14, and the   allegation is therefore not sustained.   On June 15, 2007, at approximately 0800 hours, at the Office of Professional Standards (now  known as the Independent Police Review Authority), located at 10 West 35th Street, Chicago,  Officer Novalez gave a false statement to IPRA investigator Sanchez by denying she had any  physical contact with Vanessa Gonzalez other than extending Officer Novalez’s arms to her  side to guide Gonzalez away from the altercation between Ramirez and Santana.     See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 1 above, which are incorporated here by   reference.  Given the various and conflicting accounts of the incident, the Board finds that there   is insufficient evidence to sustain the allegation that Officer Gonzalez made an intentional false   statement as to material facts regarding this incident.          POLICE BOARD DECISION      The Police Board of the City of Chicago hereby adopts the findings set forth herein by   the following votes:      By votes of 9 in favor (Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William F.  Conlon, Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D.  Sweeney) to 0 opposed, the Board finds that the allegations that Police Officer Veronica  Novalez violated Rule 6, Rule 8, and Rule 14 are not sustained.     NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the suspension of Police   Officer Veronica Novalez, Star No. 19232, for a period of ten (10) days is reversed.    This disciplinary action is adopted and entered by a majority of the members of the   Police Board: Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William F. Conlon,   Michael Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D. Sweeney.         4   Police Board Case No. 13 SR 2316  Police Officer Veronica Novalez  Findings and Decision                 DATED AT CHICAGO, COUNTY OF COOK, STATE OF ILLINOIS, THIS 20th DAY   OF MARCH, 2014.

In June, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 2,487 feet of new 8- inch water main in S. Rockwell Street (71st Street-75th Street).  The old water main dates back to  1912, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.

If  the  aggregate  cost  of  the  Project  is  less  than  the  amount  of  the  Project  Assistance  contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  the  Park  District  shall  have  no  claim  to  the  difference  between  the  amount of the  Project Assistance  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and  the amount of the Project Assistance actually paid  by the City to the  Park District and expended  by the Park District on the Project.

She asked whether the Governmental Ethics Ordinance would prohibit you from hiring your mother as a member of your personal staff under the “1012"" payroll rubric.  As explained in this opinion, the Board has determined that the Ordinance does not prohibit you from hiring your relative (here, your mother) under this “1012"" payroll rubric as a member of your personal staff.  FACTS: [Your Chief of Staff]          , and                                            of the Committee on Finance, confirmed that “1012"" persons are hired under a specific line item in the Annual Appropriation Ordinance for City Council, namely, account 015-100-2005-9001.  This account’s description says it is:  For the employment of personnel as needed by the aldermen  to  perform  secretarial,  clerical, stenographic, research, investigations or functions expressly related to the office of alderman, provided that no expenditure shall be made from this account for the purpose enumerated unless the comptroller shall be so authorized in writing by the chairman of the  committee  on  finance  (204,000  hours  at  a minimum of $6.50)  The amount appropriated for this account in 2007 and 2008 is $1,326,000.    The City’s Law Department explained to Board staff that “1012"" is the identifier of the payroll used to pay certain workers hired by the City Council under the account described above, and that being paid through that payroll does not itself determine  whether  an  individual  is  an  employee  or  a  contractor.  That determination is made using common law principles and the Internal Revenue Code.  Thus, the Law Department said, some individuals on this payroll may be employees, and some may be contractors. [Your Chief of Staff]           explained that your mother would be hired using a “Personal Services Contract,” which provides,  among  other  things,  that  it  would  be  entered  between  “the  City  of Chicago, a municipal corporation of the State of Illinois, acting through [John Doe]         , the elected Alderman of the [51st] Ward of the City, (hereinafter referred to as the ‘City’) and [name] (hereinafter referred to as the Contractor).” Thus, it appears that you intend to hire your mother as a “contractor.”    LAW  AND  ANALYSIS:    The  Ordinance  provides,  in  §  2-156-130(a),  entitled “Employment of Relatives or Domestic Partners,” that:  No  official  or  employee  shall  employ  or  advocate  for employment,  in  any  City  agency  in  which  said  official  or employee  serves  or  over  which  he  exercises  authority, supervision or control, any person (i) who is a relative ...   Case No. 07048.A November 14, 2007 Page 2  of said official or employee ... provided that the prohibition in (i) applies to City Council Committee staff but not to personal staff of an alderman.   This section of the Ordinance prohibits you from hiring your mother (who is your “relative” under § 2- 156-010(w), which defines “relative”) to work as an employee on a City Council Committee on which you serve or over which you exercise authority, supervision or control, but does not prohibit you from hiring her as an employee to work on your personal staff.    If your mother would be not an “employee” but a “contractor”–which appears to be your intention–then the issue is whether § -130(a) would in effect permit you to “employ” your mother as a “contractor” to work on your personal staff.  We conclude that it does.1  First, we believe that the term “employ” is used as a generic verb in this section, which contemplates the engagement of persons to work as either “employees” or as “contractors.”  “Employ” means “to make use of; to hire; to use as an agent or substitute in transacting business,” and, “when used in respect to a servant or hired laborer, the term is equivalent to hiring, which implies a request and a contract for a compensation.”  Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., at 471; 8th Ed., at 564.  The apparent intention behind the “1012"" budget rubric is to  grant  to  aldermen  funds  for  the  “employment  of  personnel”  to  perform  certain  tasks  at  their direction.    There  is  no  specification  that  such  persons  be  City  employees;  aldermen  have  the discretion to hire such persons to serve on their personal staffs as employees or as contractors, and, in fact, persons serving as contractors and as employees are both paid from this account. Second, the  Law  Department  confirmed  that  it  is  not  aware  of  any  rule  or  provision  that  requires  that aldermanic  workers,  including  aldermanic  personal  staff,  be  either  employees  or  contractors. Alderman  have  the  authority  in  the  budget  to  hire  both  employees  and  contractors.    Third,  our conclusion is consistent with the prohibition in § -130(b) (and thus also  §  -130  (c)).  The former provision states:  No official or employee ... shall exercise contract management authority where any relative or the domestic partner of the official or employee is employed by or has contracts with persons doing City work over which the City official or employee has or exercises contract management authority.  Under this section, you would be prohibited from signing the contract contemplated here if it were, say, with a professional services corporation of which your mother was the sole shareholder, because then you would be exercising contract management authority over a City contract with a person that employs your relative.  Cf. Case No. 99010.A.  However, § -130(b) does not apply here, because you intend to hire your mother via a contract between her personally and the City (through you, its agent). Section 130(b) would not–were the contract between you/the City and your mother personally–prohibit you from hiring her to work as a direct contractor on a City Council Committee on which you serve or  exercise  authority.  Nor  would  §-130(b)  prohibit  a  City  employee  from  exercising  contract management authority over a personal services contract directly with that employee’s relative.  Yet the Ordinance’s clear intention is still to prohibit both situations: the prohibition must therefore fall under § -130(a). That is, the Ordinance, through § -130(a), prohibits an alderman from “employing” a relative directly as a contractor to work on a City Council Committee on which he/she serves or exercises authority, supervision or control, and prohibits a City employee from “employing” a relative by signing or supervising a personal services contract directly with that relative.  But if that is so, we  1.  The Board stresses that this opinion does not intend to–and does not–decide whether your mother would be a “contractor” or an “employee.” While that issue is important for other purposes, including taxation, liability, benefits eligibility, etc. (including whether she would be subject to the Governmental Ethics Ordinance as a contractor or as an employee), it is not important for purposes of the issue before us.  Our conclusions in this case apply regardless whether your mother is an “employee” or a “contractor.”    Case No. 07048.A November 14, 2007 Page 3  conclude that it must also be that an alderman is not prohibited from hiring or “employing” a relative as a direct contractor to serve as a member of his/her personal staff–i.e. from “exercising contract management authority” over a City contract directly with a relative to serve on his/her personal staff.  We point out one other restriction.  Section 2-156-111(b), entitled “Prohibited Conduct,” provides that “no elected official ... shall retain or hire as a City employee or City contractor any person with whom any elected City official has a business relationship.”  This section prohibits you from hiring your mother to serve on your personal staff as either an employee or contractor (or from hiring any other member of your staff, or any member of a City Council Committee on which you serve or exercise authority, for that matter), if you or any other elected City official have a business relationship with her. A “business relationship” means any contractual or other private business dealing between you (as the elected official), your spouse, domestic partner, or any entity in which you or your spouse or domestic partner have a “financial interest” (in this context, that means an ownership interest that represents  10%  or  more  of  the  entity)  and  another,  if  that  contract  or  dealing  entitles  you,  your spouse/domestic partner or that entity to compensation of $2,500 or more in a calendar year.  See § 2-156-080(b)(2)(ii).    Last, we point out one more obligation.  Section 2-156-115, entitled “Time Records for Aldermanic Staff,” provides that each alderman shall maintain a daily record of the attendance  of  his or her personal employees; the record must be certified as correct by either the alderman or a designee; all records must be made available for public inspection under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act. While we have not concluded whether your mother would be a “contractor” or an “employee,” we nonetheless advise you to include her in these records, as she will be a member of your personal staff and in that sense your “personal employee.”  DETERMINATIONS: The Board determines that the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance: 1) does not prohibit you from hiring or employing your relative (here, your mother) as either a City employee or  City  contractor  under  the  “1012""  payroll  rubric  to  serve  as  a  member  of  your  personal  staff, provided that neither you nor any other elected City official (nor your/ their spouses/domestic partners or any entities in which any of you or your spouses/domestic partners have a financial interest) have a business relationship with her; and 2) does prohibit you from hiring or employing your mother as either  a  City  employee  or  City  contractor  under  the  “1012""  rubric  to  serve  on  any  City  Council Committee on which you serve or exercise authority, supervision or control.    Our determinations do not necessarily dispose of all issues relevant to this situation, but are based solely  on  the  application  of  the  City’s  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  to  the  facts  stated  in  this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify the Board immediately, as any change may alter our opinion.  Other laws or rules may also apply to this situation.  RELIANCE:  This opinion may be relied upon only by persons involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered.  ________________________________________ Michael Quirk, Vice Chair Pro-Tem Chair   C:\Documents and Settings\OPTIPLEX745-XPPRO\Desktop\For Web\07048A-red.wpd.wpd  "

The Commission on Chicago Landmarks, whose nine members are appointed by the Mayor and the City Council, was established in 1968 by city ordinance.  The Commission is responsible for recom- mending to the City Council which individual buildings, sites, objects, or districts should be designated as Chicago Landmarks, which protects them by law.  The landmark designation process begins with a staff study and a preliminary summary of information related to the potential designation criteria.  The next step is a preliminary vote by the landmarks commission as to whether the proposed landmark is worthy of consideration.  This vote not only initiates the formal designation process, but it places the review of city permits for the property under the jurisdiction of the Commission until a final landmark recommendation is acted on by the City Council.  This Landmark Designation Report is subject to possible revision and amendment during the designation process.  Only language contained within the designation ordinance adopted by the City Council should be regarded as final.  CERMAK ROAD BRIDGE DISTRICT CERMAK ROAD, PREDOMINATELY BETWEEN GROVE STREET AND JEFFERSON STREET  PERIOD OF SIGNIFICANCE:  1901-1924  The Cermak Road Bridge District, located along Cermak Road and the South Branch of the Chicago River on Chicago’s Lower West Side, is a significant ensemble of riverfront industrial buildings grouped around the city’s sole-surviving double leaf Scherzer Rolling Lift bridge. Encouraged by the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal in 1848 and the construction of the Chicago & Alton Railroad in the 1850s, industrial development along the Chicago River began in earnest and had grown exponentially by the end of the nineteenth century.  As a pivotal point for maritime traffic as well as the crossroads of railroad routes, Chicago’s location gave the merchants and manufacturers who established operations along the river a great advantage.  By 1900, newly-dredged slips and private rail sidings prompted an expansion of the city’s industrial district beyond the Loop with merchants and manufacturers building huge warehouses and factories along the banks of the North and South branches of the river, including the buildings in the Cermak Road Bridge District.  Together the buildings and bridge of the Cermak Road Bridge District form the finest intact grouping of an industrial riverfront precinct in the city, commemorating the importance of the interconnected river and rail network that criss-crossed the city to the development of Chicago.  The structures in the Cermak Road Bridge District also reflect Chicago’s vital role as a central depot that quickly evolved into the preeminent distribution center for the western United States.  As a ready supply of raw materials flowed into the city and an uninterrupted stream of manufactured goods were shipped out to every region of the United States, Chicago gained the reputation as a national center of commerce.  The Cermak Road Bridge District is the city’s finest intact ensemble of riverfront industrial buildings grouped around the city’s sole-surviving double leaf Scherzer Rolling Lift bridge.

Two significant factors in that growth, especially in terms of the city’s position as an industrial and commercial giant, were geography and transportation.  Although originally swampy and unprepossessing in appearance, Chicago’s location on the southwestern edge of Lake Michigan was an exceptional one in terms of transportation potential.  Before the widespread construction of railroads in the mid-nineteenth century, water transportation was the cheapest, fastest and most reliable means of transportation available in the United States.  The Great Lakes had been connected to the Atlantic Ocean in 1825 with the opening of the Erie Canal, and this extensive natural and manmade waterway had become a critical route for the transportation of raw materials from Western mines, forests, and farms to Eastern cities such as New York, and the subsequent reverse-route of manufactured goods back to the West.  Chicago was located where this great internal seaway came closest to the network of waterways that constituted the Mississippi River basin.  A natural “portage,” or land transfer, existed between the Chicago River, flowing into Lake Michigan, and the Des Plaines River, which eventually flowed into the Mississippi.  Early on in Chicago’s history, settlers saw the potential of a canal linking the Great Lakes with the Gulf of Mexico by way of the Mississippi. This canal, the Illinois & Michigan (I & M) Canal, was opened in 1848.  The I & M Canal had hardly been opened, however, when railroads began to transform Chicago.  Two decades before, on July 4, 1828, the first public railroad in the United States, the Baltimore & Ohio, had its first run.  Early railroads radiated out from Eastern cities at first, but in 1848 the first Chicago railroad began operation, running the short distance between Chicago and Oak Park.  By 1856 Chicago was the focus of ten trunk lines with approximately 3,000 miles of track.  To access to the downtown warehouses and factories along the river, trains entered the city from the south on rails that ran along the lakefront.  During the next three decades, new railroad lines connected Chicago with the rest of the country, and with the aggressive support of the city’s businessmen and government leaders, the city soon became America’s railroad hub.  Factories, warehouses, lumber yards, and stock yards all clustered in and near Chicago during the second half of the nineteenth century, making the city a manufacturing and wholesale center for the United States.  These industrial and commercial enterprises initially tended to be located near the easy transportation of both water and rail.  The Chicago River, including both North and South branches, soon became an important nexus for such commerce as railroad lines and spurs spread out along the river’s banks, connecting docks and riverside factories and warehouses with the country’s ever-growing railroad network.  Raw materials were brought into the city by either water or rail, transformed into finished goods through manufacturing, then shipped by rail and water to consumers.  3  Contemporary photographs from the 1860s through 1900 show the intensely commercial uses to which the Chicago River was originally put.  The river was full of ships, passing by industrial buildings of varying sizes and complexity.  Raw materials of all sorts were brought to warehouses and storage yards along the river, including lumber, metal ores, and grain. Near the Lake Michigan shore, grandly-scaled warehouses to house grain were built on the south bank of the river, at the terminus of the Illinois Central Railroad.  On the north bank of the river, east of today’s North Michigan Avenue, stood Cyrus McCormick’s reaper factory where iron ore was shaped into mass-produced farm equipment.  One of the most significant uses of the riverfront, in sheer acreage, was for lumber storage. Chicago was the lumber capital of the Midwest, with over 1 billion board feet of lumber brought to the city and processed in 1880.  The South Branch of the river, both north and south of the Cermak Road Bridge District, was especially devoted to lumber yards where timber from surrounding states such as Michigan and Wisconsin was sorted, stored, dried, and reconfigured into lots to be shipped to retailers and builders throughout the Midwest.  The land that is part of the Cermak Road Bridge District, although surrounded by lumber yards, remained largely unused through the mid-1880s.  Robinson’s fire insurance atlas of 1886 shows that the only building built within the boundaries of the district was a warehouse for the Alton Rail Company, located on the future site of the W. M. Hoyt Co. building at 465 W. Cermak Rd.  The peak years for the Chicago lumber trade were in the 1880s and early 1890s, ending in 1892.  With the exhaustion of lumber supplies reachable by water and rail from Chicago, the city’s dominance as the lumber capital of the United States began to wane.  Cheaper yellow pine from forests in Georgia and other southern states began to take preeminence, and lumber brought into Chicago in the early twentieth century was predominantly for local consumption for housing and other construction.  As lumber yards along the South Branch closed in the 1890s and early 1900s, land adjacent to the river remained attractive for warehouses and factories.   At the same time, increasing land values were forcing wholesalers and manufacturers out of downtown Chicago.  Early in Chicago’s history, during the 1830s through 1860s, the area now known as the Loop had housed a wide variety of land uses, including residential, governmental, retail, wholesale, and manufacturing.  Even after the Fire of 1871 and into the 1890s, the established retail and office area of downtown Chicago, centered along Michigan Avenue and State, Dearborn, and LaSalle Streets, was flanked to the north and west by warehouse districts devoted to wholesale, warehouse and light manufacturing uses.  The most famous of these was the wholesale food district along South Water Street, just south of and parallel to the Chicago River between Michigan and the South Branch of the Chicago River.  This “girdle” of factories and warehouses had increasingly become an impediment to downtown real estate growth by 1900.  Manufacturers and wholesale companies were encouraged, first through free-market real estate practice, then through the 1909 Plan of Chicago (which  4  5. W. M. Hoyt Company Building  465 W. Cermak Road Date: Architects: Nimmons & Fellows  1909  In 1909, the W.M. Hoyt Company commissioned the well-known architectural firm Nimmons & Fellows to design one of the finest industrial buildings in the City—this five-story Prairie School loft building along 22nd Street between Grove Street and the Chicago River.  The thriving grocery wholesaler was recognized in an 1894 publication entitled Industrial Chicago as, “one of the oldest, largest, and most successful of the great wholesale grocery houses in the West, and indeed, the country.”  The company was founded in 1857 by a pioneer of Chicago commerce, William M. Hoyt (1837-1925).  William Hoyt was born in 1837 in New Haven, Vermont.  His family relocated to Chicago when Hoyt was eighteen years old.  Upon his arrival he worked as a clerk for a grocer. The following year the enterprising young man opened his own fruit store on State and Lake streets with just eighty-nine dollars.  After the Civil War, Hoyt began acquiring other local produce companies and his company quickly became one of the largest and most successful wholesale grocers in Chicago.  By 1871, the W.M. Hoyt Company consisted of several stores and warehouses located throughout the Loop, however, all of the buildings burned in the Chicago Fire that year. Undaunted by the staggering losses, Hoyt traveled to New York immediately afterward to meet with his creditors.  A biography of William Hoyt reports, “an editorial in the New York Times a few days later announced Mr. Hoyt as the first arrival from Chicago since the fire, and mentions the results of his successful conference with his creditors as insuring that Chicago pluck would be met with New York generosity.”  William Hoyt immediately rebuilt a temporary warehouse on Canal Street and the following year the company constructed a warehouse and shop (demolished) on the site of what is now occupied by the London Guarantee Building (360 N. Michigan Avenue).  Located at what was one of the best possible commercial sites in the newly rebuilt city, the Hoyt Building was not only in close proximity to railway facilities, but steamers also docked in front of the building on the Chicago River.  The business continued to thrive due, in part, to Hoyt’s innovative advertising.  The Company published flyers entitled “To the Housewife” which promoted many of its products and asked shoppers to “remember the brand”; additionally it circulated a weekly ad paper listing the company’s “Current Price List,” and by 1901 this reached 11,000 households on Chicago’s North and West sides.  In 1909 the Hoyt Company commissioned the architectural firm of Nimmons & Fellows to design a new headquarters for the company in the industrial district at 22nd Street and the Chicago River.  Direct access to rail lines came into the warehouse on the first floor where both shipping and loading took place.

BACKGROUND   In December,  2011,  1525 HP LLC (The ""Developer"") submitted a TIF application to the  Department of Housing and Economic Development (DHED) proposing a plan to develop a site  that is approximately 2.08 acres and is located on the southwest comer of Hyde park Boulevard  (51 51  Street) and  Lake Park Avenue.  The Project Site is within the Hyde Park community and  within the 51 51  and Lake Park TIF.   The Hyde Park community area is  located on the South Side of Chicago.  The Hyde Park  community's boundaries are E Hyde Park Blvd. (51st Street) on the north, 60th Street on the  South, Lake Michigan on the East, and Cottage Grove on the West.  Hyde Park is  also home to  many visitor attractions: the University of Chicago, the DuSable Museum of African American  History, the Museum of Science and Industry and other institutions.   The site is owned by 1525 HP LLC, the Developer of the site.  The project site consists of two  parcels and three buildings.  The developer, Antheus Capital, acquired the site was acquired in  2005 through  1525 HP LLC, a single purpose entity. At the time of the purchase the site was in a  dilapidated state and the purchase was made with a plan to  create a high-quality mixed-use new  development for the Hyde Park community.   Today the site is half vacant and former tenants have come to the end of their leases.  The  Dialysis Center had operated on the site for over 20 years and the facility was inefficient and  obsolete. Davita, which purchased the business from University of Chicago in 2010, is relocating  services and patients to  a new facility at 43rd and Cottage Grove.  Village Foods occupied  Village Center for over 40 years. The Village Foods ownership group had operated 12 small  groceries across Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. At the time Antheus purchased the building,  Village Foods was the last operating business and the owners will retire on closing the store.  The  Original Pancake House, which occupied one of the buildings, has relocated to the northwest  comer of 47th and Lake Park.   The City's efforts to increase economic development in this area are evident.  At the comer of  53'd and Lake Park is Harper Court, a mixed-use project that includes office and retail space.  There you will also find the Hyatt Place Chicago at Hyde Park hotel, a 131  key hotel project.   2   TIF Developer Designation- Residentia13-12   Both projects, Harper Court and Hyatt Place Chicago at Hyde Park hotel, included TIP assistance  from the 53'-d Street TIP.   Also, the old Border's building (southwest corner of 53'd &  Lake Park) is currently being  substantial rehabilitated for a proposed retailer and a restaurant.  And, the Hyde Park Theater at  Harper and 53'd Street is also having extensive rehabilitation and is expected to open late 2012 or  spring 2013.   The City Hyde Park project is a continuation of the City's effort to spur economic development  in the Hyde Park Community.   The 51st and Lake Park TIP is a project specific for the City Hyde Park project.  It is located at  the southwest comer of 51st and Lake Park Avenue and consists of 2.25 acres.  Its boundaries are  Hyde Park Boulevard (51'' street) on the north, Lake Park Avenue on the east, Harper Avenue on  the West, the southern boundary line of tax parcels 20-11-405-008 and 20-ll-405-009 on the  South, and Harper A venue on the west.  The TIP Redevelopment Plan Eligibility was introduced  and approved to  CDC on September 11,2012.  The TIPs' primary goals include:  Elimination of  the factors that qualified the Project area as a conservation area; provides an environment that  will foster an improved quality oflife and contribute more positively to the health, safety and  general welfare of the Project area and the surrounding community;  stimulate new commercial  and mixed use development opportunities that will increase the real estate tax base of the City  and other taxing districts having jurisdiction over the Project area; and increase employment and  business opportunities for community residents.

Entrance to the lower level parking will be  located at Lake Park A venue.   The building represents an exciting and forward looking addition to the architectural legacy of  Hyde Park and the south side of Chicago. City Hyde Park will be the first multifamily residential  new construction in the community in over two decades. As a result, it will also be the first  multifamily building constructed to  contemporary accessibility standards, offering a new housing  option for people with disabilities seeking to live in the area.
