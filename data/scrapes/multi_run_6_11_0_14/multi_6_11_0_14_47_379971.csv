These rules are intended solely to provide guidance on interpretation of Chapter 2-154 of the Municipal Code (""Code"") and are not intended to abrogate any disclosure requirements contained in 65 ILCS 5/8-10-8.5 (""Disclosure""), as applicable.  I. An entity that is any unit of the United States federal, state or local government or any  agency or instrumentality thereof shall not be required to file an EDS.  2. An entity that holds an ownership interest in an Applicant of greater than 7.5%, but  less than 100%, shall not be required to file an EDS if it is one of the following and, in lieu of an EDS, provides the disclosure information required in certain instances below:  (a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  (e)  a foundation having a current tax exemption under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, so long as such foundation provides a copy of its most recent IRS Form 990; or  (i) a government entity, agency, department or instrumentality or (ii) a pension fund maintained by such a government body, or (iii) an enterprise created by Federal or state statute, but not formed as a business corporation or a not-for(cid:173) profit (e.g., Fannie Mae, Federal Home Loan Corporation, SLM Corporation) or (iv) a government-owned corporation (e.g., Government National Mortgage Association); or  a registered investment adviser that holds an ownership interest of greater than 7.5%, but less than 22.5%, beneficially for its third party investors, so long as such registered investment adviser provides a copy of its most recent Form ADV and its most recent amendment thereto; or  a mutual fund that holds an ownership interest of greater than 7.5%, but less than 22.5%, beneficially for its third party investors, so long as such mutual fund provides a copy of its form N-I A and the most recent amendment thereto; or  such other entity that holds an ownership interest of greater than 7.5%, but less than 22.5%, as a beneficial owner for a class of other third party investors and is regulated by and required to make periodic filings with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act, the Securities and Exchange Act, the Williams Act the Public Utility Holding Company Act, or the Investment Company Act or pursuant to comparable foreign securities regulatory and filing requirements, provided that (i) such entity provides a copy of such most recent filing or report, and (ii) the Corporation Counsel determines that such filing or report and the entity's disclosures therein reasonably satisfy the purposes and intent of the EDS Form.  3. Section 2-154-010 of the Municipal Code requires disclosures to be made when a person or entity ""makes application to the City of Chicago for action."" This phrase shall be construed not to apply to a transaction, and thus not to require submission of an EDS in conjunction with that transaction, if either 3A, 3B, 3C or 3D applies:  A. If the contracting party is providing money or other in-kind goods or services to the  City in exchange solely for advertising or promotional rights relating to a City-produced festival , fair, event or seasonal program (an example of a seasonal program is Riverwalk).  B. If all of the following circumstances (i) through (iv) are present:  (i)  (ii)  (iii)  (iv)  The action is being undertaken at the request of the City.  The action is being undertaken for the primary benefit ofthe City.  The affected party is not seeking the action and would not participate in the action if not for the City's request.  The affected party is uniquely situated, such that the City would be unable to seek the benefit at issue from a different party. Examples include an easement granted for the City's benefit, or site access granted by a railroad or airline for the City's benefit.  C. If the City is legally obligated, pursuant to an ordinance or an existing contract, to  execute an agreement with a party for a transaction and the City is not permitted, under its existing legal obligation, to exercise discretion in the selection of such party (e.g., a lender to an Applicant with whom the City is executing a subordination or intercreditor agreement, a third(cid:173) party depositary or escrow agent or the Applicant's landlord or tenant, or a similar co-participant in a deal involving an Applicant).  D. If the City enters into a subordination agreement or other form of intercreditor  agreement with a private lender to an Applicant, which agreement is required by a governmental entity, instrumentality or agency (~, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development) in connection with the provision of financing for affordable housing from the City to such Applicant, such private lender shall not be required to submit an EDS solely by virtue of such agreement.  4. The participation in a transaction by a party solely in that party's capacity as an escrowee or similar administrative capacity, where that party otherwise has no contracting relationship with the City in that transaction, shall not obligate that party to submit an EDS.  5. An entity that is the international olympic committee, the international paralympic  -2-  committee, a national olympic committee, a national paralympic committee, an organizing committee formed pursuant to the requirements of any international olympic committee or international paralympic committee, an international sports federation or association, a national sports federation or association, or any similar committee, federation, association or entity formed for the purpose of sponsoring, organizing, overseeing or participating in international or national athletic competitions, shall not be required to file an EDS.  6. If a Disclosing Party is required to supplement an EDS filing to comply with the  requirements of Chapter 1-23, as incorporated into Section 2-154-020, of the Code, regarding that party's status as eligible to do business with the City, such supplemental disclosure shall be provided in writing to the Office of the Corporation Counsel.  NOTE: The exceptions in these Rules are set forth as a general matter, and depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular transaction, the City reserves the right to require an EDS from anyone or more of the types of entities listed herein.

Dear Neighbor,   At Alderman Robert Fioretti’s request, I am providing you with information  regarding an upcoming water construction project in your neighborhood.  I want to  be certain you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to  call if you have any questions or concerns.   Our crews will soon be installing 612 feet of 8­inch water main in W. Adams St.  (S. Paulina St. to S. Ashland Ave.). The old main dates back to 1871 and needs to  be replaced.   We are coordinating with Alderman Fioretti’s office, and he has made clear we are  to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project.  Good communications is the  key.   I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely.  We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.   If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312­742­1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.   Thank you for your understanding and good will.   Sincerely   John F. Spatz, Jr.  Commissioner   cc:   Alderman Robert Fioretti  2 nd Ward  Do you wonder what was happening in 1871? That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:   Aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire   Corner of Dearborn and Monroe Streets, 1871   •  The first major league baseball game was played.  •   In October, four major fires broke out on the shores of Lake Michigan: in Chicago;  Peshtigo, Wisconsin; Holland, Michigan; and Manistee, Michigan. The Great Chicago  Fire is the most famous of these, although the Peshtigo Fire killed as many as 2,500  people making it the deadliest fire in United States history.   •  P.T. Barnum opened a circus, and called it “The Greatest Show on Earth.”  •  The city of Birmingham, Alabama was incorporated.  •  Harvard Summer School was founded.  •  Louisa May Alcott’s Little Men was published.  •  The first cable car was patented.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION   Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 612 feet of 8­inch water main in  W. Adams St. (S. Paulina St. to S. Ashland Ave.).   Reason:  The old main consists of 6­inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1871 and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.   Timing: Water main installation is scheduled to begin in the middle of April, with completion  of the project anticipated for the end of June. This includes restoration. This, of course, is an  estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected developments in the street, or other circumstances  (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our schedules.   Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Adams St. without interruption, but we will have  to restrict parking around our work zone.   Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.   Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.   CONTACT NUMBERS   24­HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3­1­1   ALDERMAN ROBERT FIORETTI   312­263­9273   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312­742­1029  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS   What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312­742­1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.   Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.   Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude by the end of  June. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.   Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24­hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.   Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality­of­life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

Daley, Mayor          April 22, 2011   Chicago Department of Public Health   Bechara Choucair, MD, Commissioner   Figure 1. Reported number of influenza-associated intensive care unit  hospitalizations among Chicago residents, October 9, 2010-April 16,  2011.   What is the risk?  The risk of influenza infection in Chicago continues to decline.  Locally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for in- fluenza is at its lowest level seen since early December, decreasing by nearly thirty-three percentage points from its peak in  January.  This is the fourth consecutive week that the proportion of influenza B specimens is higher than the proportion of in- fluenza A, accounting for 83% of all specimens tested.  Influenza A strains (H3N2 and H1N1) do not appear to be circulating  widely.  The influenza vaccine protects against both influenza A and B.  Vaccine is available in doctor’s offices, retail phar- macies, CDPH Neighborhood Health Centers, and immunization walk-in clinics.  A list of CDPH clinics is available on the  City of Chicago website1 and by calling 311.     Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   No influenza-associated ICU admissions were reported  for surveillance week 15 (April 10-16, 2011).  Since  October, a total of 97 influenza-associated ICU admis- sions of Chicago residents have been reported to  CDPH (Figure 1).2  Of these, 25% were children under  18 years of age and 49% were 50 years of age or older.   Thirty-one percent of ICU cases required intubation  and the three underlying medical conditions most fre- quently cited were lung diseases including asthma  (42%), heart diseases (22%), and diabetes (19%).  One  ICU case was pregnant.  No deaths were reported for  surveillance week 15.  A total of fifteen deaths have  been reported so far this season (both ICU and non- ICU) including two in pediatric patients.       How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   For the week of April 10-16, 2011, with 14 hospitals  reporting, 2.3% of emergency room visits were due to  ILI (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with cough or sore  throat). This is the lowest level recorded for the entire  influenza season and below levels reported during the  same surveillance week in 2010.  With 3 Chicago doc- tor’s offices reporting, 3.2% of visits were due to ILI.        Which influenza strains are circulating?   With 6 laboratories reporting, 6 (2.9%) of 209 speci- mens tested were positive for influenza in week 15.  One specimen tested positive for influenza A, subtyped  as 2009 H1N1.  Five specimens tested positive for in- fluenza B (Figure 2).    Where can I get more information?        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Flu- View3 report provides national updates and trends re- lated to the intensity of influenza activity across the  United States, as well as detailed information on anti- viral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics.  Updates specific to Illinois4 and Suburban Cook  County5 are also available online.    Figure 2.

WILLIAMS,  STAR No. 18542, DEPARTMENT OF POLICE,  CITY OF CHICAGO.                   )  )  )  )   No. 14 SR 2318   (CR No. 1001300)      FINDINGS AND DECISION   On or about June 16, 2011, the Superintendent of Police ordered the suspension of Police   Officer  Lawrence  R.  Williams,  Star  No.  18542, for  thirty  (30)  days  for  violating  the  following   Rules of Conduct:   Rule 6:  Disobedience of an order or directive, whether written or oral.    Rule 14:  Making a false report, written or oral.     Officer Williams received notification of this suspension on October 3, 2011.  This matter   was referred to the Police Board on January 30, 2014. This suspension is being reviewed by the   Police Board pursuant to Section 9.6A of the Agreement between the City of Chicago and the   Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #7, which states in relevant part “In the event an officer does not   make an election within ten (10) working days, the recommendation for suspension will be   reviewed by the Police Board.”   The Executive Director of the Police Board assigned this matter to Hearing Officer   Fredrick H. Bates.  Hearing Officer Bates reviewed the investigation file and submitted a written   report to the Police Board.     The members of the Police Board reviewed the Summary Report of the investigation file,   the Command Channel Review reports, and Hearing Officer Bates’ report.  Hearing Officer Bates   made an oral report to and conferred with the Police Board before it rendered its findings and   decision.   Police Board Case No. 14 SR 2318    Police Officer Lawrence R. Williams  Findings and Decision              POLICE BOARD FINDINGS   The Police Board of the City of Chicago, as a result of its consideration of this matter, finds   and determines that:   1.   There is insufficient evidence to either prove or disprove the allegation, set forth below,   that Police Officer Lawrence R. Williams, Star No. 18542, violated Rule 6, and the allegation is   therefore not sustained.   On November 14, 2006, at or about 12218 South Yale Avenue, at approximately 1522 hours,  Officer Lawrence Williams disobeyed General Order 02-08-03, Section IV.B., in that he fired  a warning shot.     On November 14, 2006, Officer Lawrence Williams, approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall and   weighing 145 pounds, responded to a criminal action at 12218 South Yale Avenue involving a   mentally ill, approximately 6-foot, 300-pound combative offender who had just injured a senior   citizen as a result of an unprovoked battery. The offender was combative with the Emergency   Medical Services (EMS) and Chicago Fire Department (CFD) personnel who responded to the   scene. When Officer Williams and his partner arrived at the scene, the offender became combative   with them. Officer Williams’s partner used his OC spray on the offender without any result, other   than to further anger the offender. Being afraid for his safety, Officer Williams un-holstered his   weapon. His partner ultimately got behind the offender, so Officer Williams began to re-holster his   weapon to avoid crossfire.  A struggle ensued with the offender. Officer Williams’s partner made   an “Officer Needs Assistance (10-1)” call; however, several EMS and CFD personnel were able to   assist Officer Williams and his partner in subduing the offender.   In a statement provided that day, Officer Williams indicated that his weapon accidentally   discharged while he was attempting to re-holster it during the struggle with the offender. He      2   Police Board Case No. 14 SR 2318    Police Officer Lawrence R. Williams  Findings and Decision    provided a consistent statement to the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA) on August 12,            2009, almost three years later. No one was injured when the weapon was discharged.   Approximately two years after the incident, on September 8, 2008, an IPRA investigator   interviewed two paramedics who were at the scene responding to the senior citizen’s injuries. One   paramedic stated that she heard someone yell: “get down!” Then she heard a gunshot. She looked   outside her vehicle and saw Officer Williams’s gun pointed upward. Her partner told IPRA that he   heard a gunshot and looked outside the ambulance and saw the offender chasing Officer Williams.   Other CFD personnel were able to help subdue the offender.   On September 16, 2008, several CFD firefighters were interviewed by IPRA. One did not   recall hearing any shots, three others heard a gunshot, but did not see either officer with their   weapon drawn. They all indicated that it took the police and CFD personnel to subdue the   offender. One of the firefighters noted that the offender was so large and muscular that it took two   sets of handcuffs linked together to cuff him.    Again on September 22, 2008, multiple CFD personnel were interviewed by IPRA. A   lieutenant stated in pertinent part that Officer Williams fired a warning shot into the air with one   hand, while fending off a charging offender with the other hand. He could not say whether Officer   Williams fully extended his arm into the air. Another firefighter indicated that when the offender   charged Officer Williams he fully extended his arm in the air and fired a warning shot. They both   stated that it took the police and CFD personnel to subdue the offender.   On October 1, 2008, another CFD firefighter was interviewed by IPRA. He stated that after   one officer sprayed the offender, he grabbed the other officer who drew his weapon and fired one   shot in the air. A firefighter did a leg sweep on the offender who fell to the ground, and a number of      3   Police Board Case No. 14 SR 2318    Police Officer Lawrence R. Williams  Findings and Decision    people then subdued him so the police could handcuff him.            In a witness statement given to the Office of Professional Standards (now known as IPRA)   on June 20, 2007, Officer Williams’s partner stated that they responded to a call to assist CFD   personnel. As they approached the offender he assumed a fighting stance. He then pepper sprayed   the offender, who wiped his face and said, “What the fuck was that?”  The offender then rushed   Officer Williams. He tried to subdue the offender from behind. He heard a gunshot. The offender   continued to attack Officer Williams as the two fell to the ground. They were able to subdue the   offender. In a statement to IPRA on August 12, 2009, Officer Williams’s partner stated that the   discharge was not a warning shot to his knowledge.   Finally, as noted above, Officer Williams provided a statement to IPRA on August 12,   2009, in which he stated that when he and his partner arrived on the scene the offender began   coming toward them in an aggressive manner despite their telling him to stop. He drew his weapon   for officer safety. His partner went behind the offender and grabbed him. As he began to holster his   weapon the offender charged him and his weapon discharged. Finally, in his statement to IPRA on   August 12, 2009, Officer Williams denied that he fired a warning shot, but stated that as he   protected his weapon from being grabbed by the offender, it may have been in a somewhat upward   position. His August 12, 2009, statement to IPRA is consistent with the statement he provided   immediately following the incident on November 14, 2006.   The statements provided by the witnesses do not adequately resolve the question as to   whether or not the round fired by Officer Williams was a warning shot as opposed to an   unintentional discharge. There is insufficient evidence to prove the allegation that Officer   Williams fired a warning shot.       4   Police Board Case No. 14 SR 2318    Police Officer Lawrence R. Williams  Findings and Decision              2.   There is insufficient evidence to either prove or disprove the allegation, set forth below,   that Police Officer Lawrence R. Williams, Star No. 18542, violated Rule 14, and the allegation is   therefore not sustained.   Subsequent to the discharge of his weapon on November 14, 2006, at or about 12218 South  Yale  Avenue,  at  approximately  1522  hours,  Officer  Lawrence  Williams  made  false  reports  regarding the details of the incident.      See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 1 above, which are incorporated here by   reference.  Given the various and conflicting accounts of the incident, the Board finds that there is   insufficient evidence to sustain the allegation that Officer Williams made intentional false reports   regarding the details of the incident.           POLICE BOARD DECISION   The Police Board of the City of Chicago hereby adopts the findings set forth herein by the   following votes:      By votes of 9 in favor (Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William F.  Conlon,  Michael  Eaddy,  Rita  A.  Fry,  Susan  L.  McKeever,  Elisa  Rodriguez,  and  Rhoda  D.  Sweeney) to 0 opposed, the Board finds that the allegations that Police Officer Lawrence R.  Williams violated Rule 6 and Rule 14 are not sustained.     NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the suspension of Police Officer   Lawrence R. Williams, Star No. 18542, for a period of thirty (30) days is reversed.    This disciplinary action is adopted and entered by a majority of the members of the Police   Board: Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, Melissa M. Ballate, William F. Conlon, Michael   Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Susan L. McKeever, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D. Sweeney.

In mid-June, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 1,221 feet of  new 8-inch water main in W. 32nd Street (Paulina-Ashland), in W. 32nd Place (Paulina-Ashland) and  in W. 32nd Place (Ashland-172’ E.E.L. of Ashland).  The old water main dates back to 1875, and  needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    12th Ward Office: 773-523-8250    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Acting Commissioner      Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  21st Ward Office: 773-881-9300  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635        Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 650 feet of 12-inch  water main in S. Exchange Avenue, from S. South Chicago Avenue to S. Anthony Avenue    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1893 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in late July 2014. This project is being coordinated with CDOT and their  department will complete all final restoration following water main construction. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Exchange Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN NATASHIA HOLMES   773-731-7777                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  July 2014. This project is being coordinated with CDOT and their department will complete all  final restoration following water main construction. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!            "

By mid December 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 2,364 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Paulina  Street, from W. 36th Street to W. 38th Street, W. 36th Street, from 31 feet east of S. Hermitage Avenue  to S. Paulina Street and W. 37th Street, from S. Paulina Street to S. Ashland Avenue. The old water  main dates back to 1886, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  12th Ward Office: 773-523-8250  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.

Background   Hurricanes, tropical storms, and other intense rotating storms fall into a general category called  cyclones. There are two main types of cyclones: tropical and extratropical (those that form outside the  tropics). Tropical cyclones get their energy from warm tropical oceans. Extratropical cyclones get their  energy from the jet stream and from temperature differences between cold, dry air masses from higher  latitudes and warm, moist air masses from lower latitudes.   This indicator focuses on tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. Tropical  cyclones are most common during the “hurricane season,” which runs from June through November.  The effects of tropical cyclones are numerous and well known. At sea, storms disrupt and endanger  shipping traffic. When cyclones encounter land, their intense rains and high winds can cause severe  property damage, loss of life, soil erosion, and flooding. The associated storm surge—the large volume  of ocean water pushed toward shore by the cyclone’s strong winds—can cause severe flooding and  destruction.   Climate change is expected to affect tropical cyclones by increasing sea surface temperatures, a key  factor that influences cyclone formation and behavior. The U.S. Global Change Research Program and  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change project that, more likely than not, tropical cyclones will  become more intense over the 21st century, with higher wind speeds and heavier rains.1,2   About the Indicator   Records of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean have been collected since the 1800s. The most reliable  long-term records focus on hurricanes, which are the strongest category of tropical cyclones in the  Atlantic, with wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour. This indicator uses historical data from the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to track the number of hurricanes per year in the  North Atlantic (north of the equator) and the number reaching the United States since 1878. Some  hurricanes over the ocean might have been missed before the start of aircraft and satellite observation,  so scientists have used other evidence, such as ship traffic records, to estimate the actual number of  hurricanes that might have formed in earlier years.   This indicator also looks at the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index and the Power Dissipation Index  (PDI), which are two ways of monitoring the frequency, strength, and duration of tropical cyclones  based on wind speed measurements.   Every cyclone has an ACE Index value, which is a number based on the maximum wind speed measured  at six-hour intervals over the entire time that the cyclone is classified as at least a tropical storm (wind  speed of at least 39 miles per hour). Therefore, a storm’s ACE Index value accounts for both strength   1   Climate Change Indicators in the United States: Tropical Cyclone Activity  www.epa.gov/climate-indicators - Updated August 2016       and duration. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calculates the total ACE Index value  for an entire hurricane season by adding the values for all named storms, including subtropical storms,  tropical storms, and hurricanes. The resulting annual total accounts for cyclone strength, duration, and  frequency. For this indicator, the index has been converted to a scale where 100 equals the median  value (the midpoint) over a base period from 1981 to 2010. The thresholds in Figure 2 define whether  the ACE Index for a given year is close to normal, significantly above normal, or significantly below.   Like the ACE Index, the PDI is based on measurements of wind speed, but it uses a different calculation  method that places more emphasis on storm intensity. This indicator shows the annual PDI value, which  represents the sum of PDI values for all named storms during the year.   Key Points   •  Since 1878, about six to seven hurricanes have formed in the North Atlantic every year. Roughly   two per year make landfall in the United States. The total number of hurricanes (particularly  after being adjusted for improvements in observation methods) and the number reaching the  United States do not indicate a clear overall trend since 1878 (see Figure 1).   •  According to the total annual ACE Index, cyclone intensity has risen noticeably over the past 20   years, and six of the 10 most active years since 1950 have occurred since the mid-1990s (see  Figure 2). Relatively high levels of cyclone activity were also seen during the 1950s and 1960s.   •  The PDI (see Figure 3) shows fluctuating cyclone intensity for most of the mid- to late 20th   century, followed by a noticeable increase since 1995 (similar to the ACE Index). These trends  are shown with associated variations in sea surface temperature in the tropical North Atlantic  for comparison (see Figure 3).   •  Despite the apparent increases in tropical cyclone activity in recent years, shown in Figures 2  and 3, changes in observation methods over time make it difficult to know whether tropical  storm activity has actually shown an increase over time.3   2   Climate Change Indicators in the United States: Tropical Cyclone Activity  www.epa.gov/climate-indicators - Updated August 2016       Figure 1. Number of Hurricanes in the North Atlantic, 1878–2015     This graph shows the number of hurricanes that formed in the North Atlantic Ocean each year from 1878  to 2015, along with the number that made landfall in the United States. The orange curve shows how the  total count in the green curve can be adjusted to attempt to account for the lack of aircraft and satellite  observations in early years. All three curves have been smoothed using a five-year average, plotted at  the middle year. The most recent average (2011–2015) is plotted at 2013.

North Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Activity According to the Accumulated Cyclone  Energy Index, 1950–2015   This figure shows total annual Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index values, which account for  cyclone strength, duration, and frequency, from 1950 through 2015. The National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration has defined “near normal,” “above normal,” and “below normal” ranges  based on the distribution of ACE Index values over the 30 years from 1981 to 2010.

North Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Activity According to the Power Dissipation Index,  1949–2015   This figure presents annual values of the Power Dissipation Index (PDI), which accounts for cyclone  strength, duration, and frequency. Tropical North Atlantic sea surface temperature trends are provided  for reference. Note that sea surface temperature is measured in different units, but the values have been  plotted alongside the PDI to show how they compare. The lines have been smoothed using a five-year  weighted average, plotted at the middle year. The most recent average (2011–2015) is plotted at 2013.  Data source: Emanuel, 20167      Indicator Notes   Over time, data collection methods have changed as technology has improved. For example, wind speed  collection methods have evolved substantially over the past 60 years, while aircraft reconnaissance  began in 1944 and satellite tracking around 1966. Figure 1 shows how older hurricane counts have been  adjusted to attempt to account for the lack of aircraft and satellite observations. Changes in data  gathering technologies could substantially influence the overall patterns in Figures 2 and 3. The effects  of these changes on data consistency over the life of the indicator would benefit from additional  research.   While Figures 2 and 3 cover several different aspects of tropical cyclones, there are other important  factors not covered here, including the size of each storm, the amount of rain, and the height of the   5   Climate Change Indicators in the United States: Tropical Cyclone Activity  www.epa.gov/climate-indicators - Updated August 2016       storm surge. The reason for the recent divergence between cyclone activity and sea surface  temperature in Figure 3 has not been identified conclusively, but it may relate to other factors that  influence the formation of storms, such as the difference in wind speeds at different levels in the  atmosphere (called vertical wind shear).8   Data Sources   Hurricane counts were compiled using methods described in Knutson et al. (2010).9 Data for Figures 1  and 2 came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Research Division,  and are available online at: www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/comparison_table.html. Values for Figure 3  have been calculated by Kerry Emanuel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both the ACE  Index and the PDI are based on wind speed measurements compiled by the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration.                                                           1   Melillo, J.M., T.C.
