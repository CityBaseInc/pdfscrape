That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:           MARGARET GORMAN, THE FIRST MISS AMERICA      In Atlantic City, New Jersey, the first Miss America pageant was held.     The United States formally ended World War I, declaring peace with Germany.      Wonder Bread was baked for the first time.    The “Black Sox” trial began in Chicago.    The World Series was broadcast on the radio for the first time; the Yankees beat the   Giants 3-0.     President Harding dedicated the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.                                       WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will install 3,947 feet of 8-inch water main in  S. Dr. Martin Luther King Drive, from E. 103rd Street to E. 109th Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1921 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We expect our work to start shortly, and be completed in December. Final restoration  will follow in the spring of 2016. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If  there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN ANTHONY BEALE   773-785-1100      PETE SCALES   DEPARTMENT OF WATER MANAGEMENT   312-744-8822                        FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in December. Final  restoration will follow in the spring of 2016. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since  we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

If a brand name drug is dispensed when a generic alternative is available, you  pay the difference in cost between the generic and the brand name as well as the  generic copayment.  The Plan will not pay more than it would pay for the generic  medication, if you buy a brand name drug when a generic alternative is available. If you elect to purchase a brand medication without trying an appropriate  generic medication in the same therapeutic class, you will pay the full cost of the  medication.  If you try the generic medication and your physician finds that the  generic medication is not effective in treating your condition, you will be able  to receive the brand medication at the copayment applicable to non-formulary  or formulary.   If you do not try the preferred medication for the therapeutic class, you will pay the  full cost of the medication.  If you try the preferred specialty medication and it is  not effective in treating your condition, you will be able to receive a non-preferred  formulary drug. Requiring the use of mail order will reduce costs for the City and Retirees. After  2 fills of your generic or formulary brand medication at a retail pharmacy, you will  be required to use mail order for any additional fills through CVS-Caremark in  Mount Prospect, IL. If you do not use the mail order program for your 3rd or any  subsequent fills, you will pay the full cost of the prescription.  If your medication is  non-formulary, however, you must continue to use the retail pharmacy.  If you do not go to a network retail pharmacy, you pay the full amount when you pick  up your prescription. You must then submit a receipt for reimbursement. The Plan  will pay 60% of the Plan’s cost, after you’ve met the deductible (if applicable).   There is no formulary list if you go to an out-of-network pharmacy.  *   **   ***    PPO MAXIMUM ALLOWANCE – THE AMOUNT THAT PROVIDERS WHO HAVE CONTRACTED WITH THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR  HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT AS REIMBURSEMENT.

How does a discharge case reach the Police Board?   Civilian  complaints and   CPD notifications  of alleged police  misconduct  received by the  Civilian Office    of Police  Accountability  (COPA)              Charges filed  with the Police  Board and    immediately    served on the  accused officer.    Charges are    then posted on    the PB website.   Investigation by  COPA, CPD  Internal Affairs,  or City Inspector  General              Four possible  outcomes of  investigation:    Sustained    Not sustained    Exonerated    Unfounded        If complaint is  sustained  (allegation  supported by  sufficient  evidence),  discipline is  recommended  to the Supt.   If the Supt.  recommends  discharge,  written charges  and  specifications  filed with the  Police Board.   How does the Police Board decide discharge cases?   Case assigned to  hearing officer;  The Supt. is  represented by  Corp. Counsel;  Officer by her/  his attorney.        Disciplinary  hearing at which  witnesses testify  under oath (the  hearing is open  to the public).      Decision based  on the evidence  presented at the  hearing.   Final vote at PB  public meeting.  Detailed written  decision issued  and posted on  PB website.   The Role of the Police Board     The role of the Board is to be an impartial decision-maker that makes decisions   based on the evidence made part of the record at the disciplinary hearing.      All of the Board’s disciplinary hearings are open to the public. Both the   Superintendent and the accused Officer have a right to due process—at the hearing  they each have a right to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses.      The Board takes final action on all cases in public at its monthly meeting, where   each Board member’s vote is announced and recorded.      The Board posts on its website its written decisions, which include detailed   explanations of the reasons for the Board’s findings.       Impartiality, due process, and transparency are essential values of any police  disciplinary system—guided by these values, the Police Board promotes accountability and  increases the public’s and police officers’ confidence in the process for handling allegations  of police misconduct.    See the brochure Allegations of Police Misconduct: A Guide to the Complaint and Disciplinary  Process for more detailed information.

In October, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install a new  sewer in North Monticello Avenue from West Ohio Street to West Governors Parkway. The  old sewer needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons.  Outside of  working hours, a travel lane will be left open for local traffic only.  You will always be able  to reach your home or business.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We  know  that  construction  always  involves  inconveniences  and  noise.  We  will  do  everything  possible  to  maintain  your  quality  of  life  throughout  these  projects,  and  conducting  ourselves  as  good  and  thoughtful  neighbors  in  the  course  of  our  presence  on  your street.     Should  you  have  any  questions  or  concerns,  you  can  either ask  the  construction  foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    27th Ward Office: 312-432-1995    37th Ward Office: 773-379-0960    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank  you  in  advance  for  your  patience  and  cooperation  during  this  important  infrastructure improvement project.

The Board’s opinion is based on the facts set out in the Memorandum.      As with all Board opinions, the Board’s opinion in this case is confidential in accordance  with the provisions of the City’s Campaign Financing and Governmental Ethics  Ordinances–this means that the Board and its staff will not discuss this opinion or its  underlying request for it unless it has the requestor’s express waiver of this  confidentiality.      Reliance: The opinion in the following Memorandum may be relied upon by any person  involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which it is rendered.      MEMORANDUM   Board of Ethics   Case No. 10046.CNS/”Gifts” and Negotiated Contractual Provisions   ________________________________  Steven I. Berlin, Executive Director     To:    From:  ________________________________    Richard J. Superfine,   Legal Counsel          Date:  September 8, 2010    Re:      Recently, Board Staff has been asked several related questions by City employees: whether, and  if  so  how,  the  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance's  gift  restrictions  would  or  should  apply  to  the  acceptance  by  City  employees  or  officials  of  items  or  services  negotiated  by  the  City  (and,  presumably, approved by the Department of Procurement Services and/or Corporation Counsel),  and  memorialized  in  contractual  provisions?  For  example:  1)  the  City  buys  software,  and  the  vendor  contractually  agrees  to  provide  pc’s  to  the  City  ""at  no  extra  cost”;  or  2)  a  likely  more  frequent scenario: a vendor contractually agrees to pay for travel for one or a few City employees  to attend periodic product training seminars or facility inspections.  The Board has not addressed  these questions formally.  In the past, Staff has advised City employees that the Ordinance does  not prohibit these contractual provisions or the acceptance of items or services by City employees  or officials pursuant to them.  However, Staff believes it is in the City’s interest that the Board  revisit the issue more thoroughly and clarify its advice more formally.    The relevant Ordinance section is §2-156-040, entitled “Offering, Receiving and Soliciting Gifts  and Favors.”  It states in pertinent part:     (b) No person shall give or offer to give to any official, employee or City contractor  ... and none of them shall accept, anything of value, including, but not limited to, a  gift, favor or promise of future employment, based upon any mutual understanding,  either explicit or implicit, that the votes, officials actions, decisions or judgments of  any official, employee or City contractor, concerning the business of the City would  be influenced thereby ...   (c) No person who has an economic interest in a specific City business, service or  regulatory transaction shall give...to any City official or employee whose decision or  action may substantially affect such transaction... (ii) an item or service other than a  gift with a  value of less than $50.00...   (d) Except as prohibited in subsections (a) and (b), nothing in this Section 2-156-040  shall  prohibit  any  person  from  giving  or  receiving...  (iv)  reasonable  hosting  ...  furnished  in  connection  with  public  events,  appearances  or  ceremonies  related  to  official City business, if furnished by the sponsor of such public event.           Case No. 10046.CNS  September 8, 2010  Page 1         (f) Nothing in this Section 2-156-040 shall prohibit any official or employee...from  accepting a gift on the City’s behalf; provided, however, the person accepting the  gift  shall  promptly  reports  receipt  of  the  gift  to  the  Board  of  Ethics  and  to  the  Comptroller, who shall add it to the inventory of City property.     For  years,  the  Board  has  interpreted  these  sections  by  in  effect  using  a  “business  purpose”  analysis  regarding  trips  or  training  programs  and  associated  travel  expenses  offered  by  a  City  vendor or would-be vendor. The Board has concluded, for example, that the Ordinance allows  City  employees’  attendance  at  software  user  group  meetings,  training  classes,  or  tours  of  manufacturers’  facilities–if  the  Board  receives  affirmation  from  the  department  head  or  a  department’s senior management that attendance by the relevant City employees (and only those  employees)  is  important  for  the  department  to  operate  more  effectively.    See,  e.g.  Case  Nos.  91075.Q;  96020.Q;  97014.Q;  98039.Q;  98044.Q;  01007.Q;  03053.Q.  Under  these  cases,  these  “business  purpose”  travel  expenses  are  not  considered  “gifts,”  for  purposes  of  the  Ordinance;  however, any items or services offered beyond reasonable and necessary business travel expenses  are considered gifts (like entertainment or other things of a personal nature), and their acceptance  thus  must  be  analyzed  under  the  Ordinance’s  gift  restrictions.1  Similarly,  the  Board  has  recognized that City employees, or a City department, may treat certain items or services as gifts  accepted on behalf of the City, such as pc’s or software, for example, provided those items or  services are not purely personal, but are useable by the City or displayed for the benefit of the  public, and are reported to the Board and the Comptroller as gifts to the City. They then become  part  of  the  City’s  inventory.  See  Case  Nos.  88005.A  (television  set);  88092.A  (computer  equipment); 91062.Q (radio); 91064.Q (reasonable travel expenses to conference where offeror  was not the sponsor).     But we address here situations in which the City negotiates a contract provision under which the  contractor agrees to provide travel expenses to City employees for stated purposes (educational,  training or inspections, typically), or to provide personal computers or other items at no additional  charge  to  the  City.  Is  such  a  contract  provision  “automatically”  taken  out  of  the  ambit  of  the  Ordinance’s gift restrictions? Put another way, could acceptance by a City employee or official of  a  contractually  negotiated  benefit  constitute  a  prohibited  gift,  item  or  service  under  the  Ordinance’s  gift  restrictions?  Consistent  with  cases  not  involving  contractual  provisions  (see  above) Board staff believes that it could, if: i) the value offered  and accepted exceeds what is  necessary under a “business purpose” analysis, or that value is personal in nature; and ii) the City  is not already paying for it through the contract price.2 That is, we believe that, in instances                                                               1.  We note that the issue of whether such personal items or services can be negotiated into a City contract in the first place is not,  primarily, a question that arises under the Governmental Ethics Ordinance, but is addressed by other City policies and Ordinances, as  well as by State law. We do not intend to imply that the Ordinance either permits or prohibits this–rather, that, were such a case to  arise, the Board would address the Ordinance’s application at that time.   2.  We note that if the contractor specifically includes the cost of business travel as part of its contract bid, then the City pays for it.   This would take the matter out of the ambit of § 2-156-040 of the Ordinance (cf. footnote 1, above; that situation would likely raise  issues under other laws and policies, but we are not addressing that here).  This Memorandum, however, is intended to address those  situations in which the cost is not so specified in advance, and thus where the contractor appears to be paying the expenses, not the  City.  See also Ohio Ethics Commission Advisory Opinion No. 87-007 (August 14, 1987). There, the question was whether State  employees  could  accept  travel  expenses  from  parties  doing  business  with  the  State  where  such  expenses  were  paid  pursuant  to  contract. The Ohio Ethics Commission answered “yes,” essentially under the theory that, where the State included the requirements in  its contract bid specifications, potential vendors would include such expenses in the contract price. It stated:     It is apparent that parties, in submitting a bid to the [State], will include the cost of the trips in their proposals, and that such  expenses are a cost included in the final contract price. Therefore, the travel expenses are a cost for which the [State] pays  consideration. Ultimately, it is the [State] which bears the cost of the trips.      Case No. 10046.CNS  September 8, 2010  Page 3    where  the  City  is  not  clearly  paying  for  the  negotiated  contractual  item  or  service,  the  Board  should  not  simply  presume  a  valid  “business  purpose.”  Such  a  presumption  could  allow  the  possibility  of  uncontrolled  contracting,  or  vitiate  the  Ordinance’s  gift  restrictions–or  foster  the  perception that this is what is happening.  Hence, we recommend that the Board interpret § 2-156- 040 in line with past cases, such that, even in negotiated contract situations, there must be a valid  “business purpose” for anything of value offered and paid by a City contractor that appears in its  City contract, and that this value accepted must be limited to the business purpose itself.     Staff has extensively researched how other jurisdictions treat the issue, but found little relevant  authority. However, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) of the U.S. Department  of Defense (DOD) has addressed the issue in its guidelines entitled “Ethics Issues in Government- Contractor Teambuilding.” General Rule, p. 11, No. 7, in that document states that the following  is  not  a  gift:  “Anything  which  is  paid  for  by  the  Government  or  secured  by  Government  contract.” The first clause is not at issue here. As to the second clause (“secured by Government  contract”),  a  DOD  attorney  explained  that  DCMA  does  in  fact  review  contracts  to  determine  whether  an  item  or  service  appearing  in  a  contract  provision  meets  the  “business  purpose”  requirement. If it does, then it is permitted. The indicia DCMA uses to determine if there is a  business purpose include: (i) is the gifting recited in the contract; (ii) is it tied to the contract’s  purpose;  (iii)  is  it  necessary  to  a/the  provision  with  which  it  is  associated;  (iv)  will  it  aid  in  contract performance; and (v) was it carefully negotiated? The DOD attorney did not recall an  instance where the business purpose test was not met.3    This analysis is compelling to Staff. Staff thus recommends that the Board determine that an item  or service to be provided by a contractor does not automatically become permissible or taken out  of the ambit of the Ordinance’s gift restrictions simply because it has been negotiated and appears  in the contract. The first question when these matters                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This opinion is consistent with the first clause in DCMA Guideline General Rule p. 11 No. 7, mentioned below.       3.  Further, the attorney confirmed that the Government may accept gifts to itself. Guideline Rule p. 21, Example 6 p. 24; Guideline  General Rule p. 40, Example 4 p. 41.      Case No. 10046.CNS  September 8, 2010  Page 4    arise is whether the City is in fact paying for the item or service.  Unless it is clear in the given  situation4 that the City is paying for the recited item or service, then the item or   service is being paid for by the contractor (or would-be contractor).  It may be a gift, and, under  the  Ordinance,  may  be  prohibited.  To  determine  that,  Staff  believes  that  the  next  question  is  whether the recited item or service has a “business purpose” (see the DOD criteria, above, which  Staff recommends the Board adopt with respect to contractual provisions).  If it does, and it is  reasonable in value and limited to that business purpose, then it is not a gift, and is not prohibited  under Ordinance §2-156-040(c), nor by -040(b) if there is no evidence of a mutual understanding  between  the  offeror  and  recipient  regarding  City  decisions  or  actions.  (Cf.  Case  No.  88134.A,  where the Board concluded that reasonable hosting expenses, including travel expenses, are not  “gifts,” but are still subject to the conditions set forth in §§ 2-156-040(a) and (b), namely that  they are not anonymous and not offered or accepted based on a mutual understanding concerning  the  recipient’s  City  judgments  or  actions.)  However,  if  the  item  or  service  does  not  have  a  “business purpose,” then it must be analyzed under the Ordinance’s gift restrictions and Board  case  law  to  determine  if  it’s  prohibited  thereunder,  or  if  it  may  still  be  accepted  by  the  City  employee  (or  City  department)  it  will  benefit.  If  the  appropriate  conditions  are  present  (for  example, the item can be displayed publicly, for the enjoyment or use of the public, despite its not  having a “business purpose”), then acceptance of the item or service may be treated as a gift to  the City and accepted on behalf of the City under §2-156-040 (f) and reported to the Board and  Comptroller as such.    In  the  two  instances  mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  this  Memo,  then,  the  pc’s  provided  “at  no  extra  cost”  would  not  be  gifts,  as  they  have  a  clear  business  purpose.  Similarly,  as  to  the  contractor-provided  travel,  the  Board’s  analysis  over  the  years  does  not  change:  provided they  have a valid business purpose, and are limited to what is necessary to fulfill that business purpose,  then these benefits are not gifts, and their acceptance is not prohibited by the Ordinance.                                                                 4.  This could be demonstrated, for example, if the price of the item or service is explicitly itemized as part of the City’s price. It will  depend  on  the  contract  bid  documents,  the  contract’s  terms  themselves,  and  the  statements  and  understanding  of  the  City’s  and  contractor’s negotiators.   "

Greenview Avenue, from W. Berteau Avenue to W. Irving Park Road.            Reason: The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890, and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Work starts shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in late June (restoration  will follow in late July). This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected  developments in the street, or other circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our  schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Greenview Avenue without interruption, but we  will have to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   ALDERMAN GENE SCHULTER   773-348-8400   3-1-1         312-742-1029   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June.  Restoration will follow in late July. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are  at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

The Commission is responsible for recommend- ing to the City Council which individual buildings, sites, objects, or districts should be designated as Chicago Landmarks, which protects them by law.  The landmark designation process begins with a staff study and a preliminary summary of information related to the potential designation criteria.  The next step is a preliminary vote by the landmarks commission as to whether the proposed landmark is worthy of consideration.  This vote not only initiates the formal designation process, but it places the review of city permits for the property under the jurisdiction of the Commission until a final landmark recommendation is acted on by the City Council.  This Landmark Designation Report is subject to possible revision and amendment during the  designation process. Only language contained within a designation ordinance adopted by the City Council should be regarded as final.  2  KENWOOD UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST (ORIGINALLY KENWOOD EVANGELICAL CHURCH) 4600-08 S. GREENWOOD AVE.  BUILT:  1887-88 (CHURCH BUILDING) 1924 (GYMNASIUM WING)  ARCHITECTS: WILLIAM W. BOYINGTON AND HENRY B. WHEELOCK                                (CHURCH BUILDING)  CHATTEN AND HAMMOND (GYMNASIUM WING)  Built in 1887-88 in the South-Side Kenwood neighborhood, the Kenwood United Church of Christ is an outstanding example of a Richardsonian Romanesque-style church building.  The style grew from the work of nationally-renowned architect Henry Hobson Richardson and was very popular in the United States during the 1880s and 1890s.  The building’s rough-textured granite and sandstone walls, corner bell tower, round-arched entrances, windows and tower openings, and foliate-detailed columns and sculptural panels comprise a textbook example of this architectural style.  A 1924 gymnasium wing by architects Chatten and Hammond is designed in a modest twentieth-century variation on the Romanesque Revival and complements the older church building.  The building was originally built for the Kenwood Evangelical Church, conceived as a nondenominational “community church” that drew congregants from a variety of evangelical Protestant denominations throughout the Kenwood community.  The church was a prominent religious institution in this upper-income neighborhood for decades; members included John G. Shedd, president of Marshall Field & Co. and the benefactor of the Shedd Aquarium, and Edgar Lee Masters, noteworthy poet and author of Spoon River Anthology.  3  The Kenwood United Church of Christ is the work of architect William W. Boyington, working in association with Harry B. Wheelock.  Boyington was one of the earliest architects working in Chicago, arriving in the city in 1853.  During his more than forty-year practice, Boyington designed many of the burgeoning city’s most prominent buildings, including many early churches, hotels, educational buildings, railroad stations, and commercial buildings.  Almost all of Boyington’s Chicago buildings were either destroyed in the Chicago Fire of 1871 or were subsequently lost to redevelopment.  Four that remain are Chicago Landmarks: the iconic Old Chicago Water Tower and the Pumping Station on North Michigan Ave.; the Rosehill Cemetery Gatehouse on N. Ravenswood Ave. on Chicago’s North Side; and the Soldier’s Home on E. 35th St. on Chicago’s South Side.  The Kenwood United Church of Christ is a rare-surviving Chicago building from this important architect’s career.  BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND DESCRIPTION  In June 1885, a group of Kenwood residents organized a Sunday school for themselves and their families.  At the time, Kenwood was a relatively sparsely-settled suburban community in the Township of Hyde Park, connected to Chicago by the Illinois Central Railroad.  The new Sunday school was conceived as a nondenominational institution that would serve the entire community regardless of the denominational affiliations of members.  The Sunday school was so successful that in November, later that same year, its founders organized a new church, the Kenwood Evangelical Church, which was the predecessor church of today’s Kenwood United Church of Christ.  The newly-established church was originally housed in a small wood-frame building at Woodlawn and Lake (now Lake Park), near E. 45th St.  At the time of the church’s founding, the Kenwood community, bounded by Lake Michigan, 43rd St., Cottage Grove Ave., and 51st St. (now Hyde Park Blvd.), had developed an enviable reputation as a premier upper-income suburban enclave of large single-family houses set on generous, lushly-landscaped lots. In his 1874 book, Chicago and Its Suburbs, author Everett Chamberlin called Kenwood “the Lake Forest of the south,” comparing it to the exclusive North Shore suburb.  This early history as a well-to- do residential community began with an early resident, Dr. John Kennicott, who established a substantial country estate called “Kenwood” in the area in 1856 soon after the construction of the Illinois Central Railroad made this rural lakefront readily accessible to the city of Chicago to the north.  The Illinois Central’s 47th St. station, a short distance from Kennicott’s house, was also named “Kenwood,” and this soon became the name for the surrounding new community in general, and the new church in particular.  The new Kenwood Evangelical Church was conceived as a “community church”—a nondenominational church that was meant to serve the entire Kenwood community and draw  4  .  e v A s     i l l  E    .

In the case of Kenwood Evangelical, the founders explicitly focused their efforts on evangelical Protestant denominations.  Historically, “community churches” had long been in existence in the United States, primarily in rural areas and towns too small to financially sustain individual denominations.  By the late nineteenth century, however, such nondenominational churches were forming in major cities where there was a burgeoning interest in ecumenism and interfaith cooperation.  By the 1920s, the establishment of community churches had become common enough throughout the country that historians consider them an important component of the twentieth-century ecumenical movement.  In Chicago, other community churches that were formed in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries besides Kenwood Evangelical Church include Metropolitan Community Church (the predecessor to today’s Metropolitan Apostolic Community Church) in the Bronzeville neighborhood and Bethany Union Church in the Beverly community.  The new Kenwood Evangelical Church grew quickly, drawing its membership from the community’s many prosperous residents, and it soon outgrew its modest chapel.  Within two years of its founding, the congregation decided to build a larger, more visually- impressive church building, and architects William W. Boyington and Henry B. Wheelock were hired to design it.  The building’s cornerstone was laid on November 26, 1887, and construction continued into late 1888, with a building dedication held on November 18, 1888.   The building (including furnishings) cost more than $64,000.  Building description The Kenwood United Church of Christ is located on the southwest corner of S. Greenwood Ave. and E. 46th St. It is a large, visually-picturesque building with an impression of great mass and scale due to walls built of rusticated gray Maryland granite and trimmed with buff Bedford sandstone.  The front portion of the building houses the church sanctuary and has a large, broad front-gable roof.  A rear Sunday school wing is sheltered under a cross-gable roof.  A 70-feet-high corner bell tower marks the corner of Greenwood Ave. and 46th St.  It is also clad and detailed with rough-textured gray granite and sandstone.  Each street elevation of the tower has a large round arch that frames a pair of smaller round-arched openings separated by a cluster of thin colonettes ornamented with a broad Romanesque- style foliate capital.  Each elevation of the tower has a horizontal row of rectangular openings with pairs of squat Romanesque-style columns with foliate-detailed capitals. The tower is capped by a hip roof.  To the south of the bell tower, the Greenwood elevation of the church building is 75 feet wide and consists of a broad sweeping stone-clad gable pierced by a central cluster of round-arched windows, articulated by tall, smooth-finished, attached Romanesque-style columns and rusticated-stone transom bars.  Below this cluster of windows is a smaller band of rectangular windows separated by pairs of short, engaged Romanesque-style columns. Entrances at the southern end of the Greenwood façade and the base of the bell tower are ornamented with Romanesque-style paired colonnettes that visually support recessed stone  6  Top: The sanctuary of the Kenwood United Church of Christ seats 1,700 worshipers and is a grandly-scaled space under a large gable supported by a medieval-inspired wood-truss roof. A balcony overlooks the main floor and is detailed with wood paneling.  Stained glass fills many sanctuary windows. Bottom left: A detail of the ceiling truss.  Bottom right:The front of the sanctuary is ornamented with a large round arch filled with pipes for the church’s Skinner organ, wood paneling and other wood trim.  12

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you, our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our private contractor will soon install a new sewer in E. 16th Street, from S. Wabash Avenue to  S. Indiana Avenue. The old sewer dates back to 1871 and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Fioretti’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.       Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     Cc: Alderman Robert Fioretti         2nd Ward                                              1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1              Do you wonder what was happening in 1871? That’s the year the old sewer was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:       Aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire   Corner of Dearborn and Monroe Streets, 1871        The first major league baseball game was played.     In October, four major fires broke out on the shores of Lake Michigan: in Chicago;  Peshtigo, Wisconsin; Holland, Michigan; and Manistee, Michigan. The Great Chicago  Fire is the most famous of these, although the Peshtigo Fire killed as many as 2,500  people making it the deadliest fire in United States history.     P.T. Barnum opened a circus, and called it “The Greatest Show on Earth.”    The city of Birmingham, Alabama was incorporated.    Harvard Summer School was founded.    Louisa May Alcott’s Little Men was published.    The first cable car was patented.                                PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management’s private contractor will soon install a new  sewer in E. 16th Street, from S. Wabash Avenue to S. Indiana Avenue.    Reason:  The old sewer main dates back to 1871 and needs replacement. The area bounded by  15th Street on the north, 18th Street on the south, Indiana on the east and Dearborn on the west  will benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  The contractor’s work starts shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in mid- December.  Final restoration will follow in late May 2014. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:  We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours. When we are working in  the street, we may have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to  reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place. Outside of working  hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.           CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN ROBERT FIORETTI   312-263-9273      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021             FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS           Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Fioretti, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

In mid-June, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 1,875 feet of  new 8-inch water main in S. Seeley Avenue (53rd Place-Garfield), in W. 54th Street (500’ west of  Hoyne –Hoyne), and in W. 54th Place (500’ west of Hoyne-Hoyne).  The old water main dates back  to 1895, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    15th Ward Office: 773-306-0837    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Commissioner of Water Management     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,757 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Albion Avenue, from N.  Ravenswood Avenue to N. Clark Street, and in W. Arthur Avenue from N. Ravenswood Avenue  to N. Clark Street. The old pipe dates back to 1915, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Silverstein’s office, and she has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:            BILLIE HOLIDAY               In Washington D.C., the first stone of the Lincoln Memorial was put into place.     The U.S. House of Representatives rejected a proposal granting women the right to vote.      Pluto was photographed for the first time, but not recognized as a planet.    John B. Gruelle was given a patent for his Raggedy Ann doll.    American jazz and blues singer Billie Holiday was born.    The first stop sign appeared in Detroit, Michigan.    Woodrow Wilson became the first President to attend a World Series game.                         WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,757 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Albion Avenue, from N. Ravenswood Avenue to N. Clark Street, and in W.  Arthur Avenue from N. Ravenswood Avenue to N. Clark Street.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1915 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in July. Final restoration will follow in August. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN DEBRA SILVERSTEIN   773-262-1050      PETE SCALES – DEPARTMENT OF WATER MANAGEMENT        312-744-8822                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in July. Final  restoration will follow in August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at  the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

You previously served as  Commissioner of [City Department U]. On October 11, 2004, you requested an advisory opinion under the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance.  You asked us to address how your former service as Commissioner [of Department U] affects your ability, and that of your new employer, [ABC, Inc. (ABC)] to participate in: 1) two specific contracts [with your former department]; and 2) business transactions involving the City’s [facility] system generally.1   After careful consideration of the facts presented and the relevant law, the Board has determined that you are subject to significant restrictions (set forth in detail below in the “Determinations” section of this opinion) under both the one-year and permanent  prohibitions  of  the  Ordinance’s  post-employment  provisions.  In summary, as to the specific matters you raised, you are permanently prohibited from assisting or representing [ABC, Inc.], or any other person other than the City, on either of the contracts [with your former department] you identified; you also are prohibited for one year from the date you left City service from assisting or representing [ABC, Inc.], or any other person other than the City, on any business transaction  involving  the  operation,  maintenance  or  development  of  the  City’s [facility] system, including but not limited to [Facility 1 and Facility 2].  FACTS: City Service as [Commissioner of Department U].2 You were appointed Commissioner of [Department U] on [DATE] and served in that capacity until you resigned from City service on [DATE]. As Commissioner, you had overall and ultimate responsibility for [the City’s facility system] which, at that time, included three  [facilities]:  [Facility  1,  Facility  2  and  Facility  3].  Your  responsibilities included  overseeing  the  various  functions  within  [that  facility  system]  such  as [facility]  operations, maintenance, planning, finance, capital projects, security and [certain other functions].    1  Under  Rule  3-10  of  the  Board’s  Rules  and  Regulations,  the  identity  of  any  person requesting an advisory opinion, and the identity of any person whose conduct is involved in  the  set  of  circumstances  described  in  the  request,  shall  remain  confidential  in accordance with Section 2-156-380(l) of the Ethics Ordinance. Any party to the request, however,  may  waive  his  confidentiality.  In  a  supplemental  letter  to  the  Board,  dated October 12, 2004, you gave the Board permission to speak to [ABC] and to [Department U] in responding to your request for an advisory opinion.   2 In [YEAR], you entered City employment and held various posts in City government until you were appointed Commissioner of [Department U].   Case No. 04058.A January 12, 2005 Page 2  In carrying out your various responsibilities, you were assisted by a management team that included a First Deputy and several Assistant Commissioners, as well as numerous Deputy Commissioners. Each major functional area was headed by a Deputy Commissioner.  Deputies of related functional areas reported to managing deputies who, in turn, reported to you. Your management team oversaw the work of approximately [number] Department employees, most of whom were assigned to a single [facility].3    This  City  staff  was  augmented  by  Department  consultants,  vendors,  contractors, construction  managers  and  various  other  professional  service  providers.  These  services  were acquired through RFQs, RFPs and public bids issued by the Department of Procurement Services with  the  assistance  of  the  City’s  Law  Department.  Typically,  your  role  in  these  procurement processes  was  one  of  general  oversight  and  periodic  review  of  progress;  a  Deputy  or  other Department staff member typically had direct oversight responsibility.  [ABC, Inc.]    On [DATE], you joined [ABC], an Illinois construction firm and City subcontractor, as its President and Chief Operating Officer. You stated that [ABC] is an Illinois-based construction company consisting of approximately 65 full time employees. [ABC] focuses on projects in the $1,000.000.00 to $5,000,000.00 range. When necessary, [ABC] contracts for larger projects through joint ventures. Since its founding in [YEAR], [ABC] has provided a range of construction services including: (i) general contracting; (ii) construction management; (iii) program management; and (iv) trade work.4  As President and Chief Operating Officer of [ABC], you are responsible for the management and oversight  of  [ABC’s]  day-to-day  activities,  including  finances,  administration  and  operations. Reporting to you are a Senior Vice-President for Construction, a Vice President for Construction, a Vice President for Estimating and Construction, an Assistant Vice President for Human Resources and a Controller.  You, in turn, report to [ABC’s] Board of Directors. [John Smith, ABC’s Chief   3 A limited number of City personnel were responsible for oversight of functions which were common to all three [facilities].         4[A corporate history of ABC, Inc. follows.]  Case No. 04058.A January 12, 2005 Page 3  Executive Officer], is also Chairman of [ABC’s] Board. [Mr. Smith] is  responsible for marketing, as well as managing and directing the Senior Vice President for Construction on all [Department U] matters.  [ABC] as City Subcontractor.  You have asked us to address 2 specific [Department U] contracts in this  advisory opinion:  1. [Contract 1].  On or about [DATE], the City entered into a [development and lease agreement]  with  [Contractor  1],  a  joint  venture  of  [Entity  1  and  Entity  2].  Under  this agreement, the joint venture is developing [ facilities on a particular parcel of land.] [John Smith], a principal and Chief Executive Officer of [ABC], is, himself, a member of [Entity 2].  In addition, [ABC], is a subcontractor to the joint venture and has performed construction work at [the site] pursuant to this contract.  You  stated  that  your  involvement  as  Commissioner  [of  Department  U]  in  the  selection/ award/execution of [Contract 1] included the following: you reviewed and approved the scope of services for the RFP developed by [a Department U Managing Deputy]; although you were not part of the City team that reviewed and scored responses to the RFP, you did review and approve the  team’s contract-award recommendations; and although you did not participate in contract negotiations, you did recommend negotiation and execution of an agreement with [Contractor 1] to the City’s Chief Procurement Officer.   2. [Contract 2].  On or about [DATE], [Contractor 2] entered into a contract with the City to provide construction management services to [Department U]. [ABC] is a  subcontractor to [Contractor 2] on this contract and is currently overseeing construction work by [another contractor] at [Facility 1].   You  stated  that  your  involvement  as  Commissioner  [of  Department  U]  in  the  selection/ award/execution of [Contract 2] included the following: you reviewed the scope of services for the RFQ developed by [a Department U Managing Deputy]; although you were not part of the City team that reviewed and scored responses to the RFQ, you did review and approve the team’s contract-award recommendations; and although you did not participate in contract negotiations,  you  did  recommend  negotiation  and  execution  of  an  agreement  with [Contractor 2] to the City’s Chief Procurement Officer. You stated that, as Commissioner [of Department U], you also participated in Department discussions on how to apportion work between [Contractor 2] and another Department contractor (providing construction management services for [facility] and civil work).  Case No. 04058.A January 12, 2005 Page 4  Ethical Screen. You stated that since joining [ABC] on [DATE], you have had no involvement in either [Contract 1 or Contract 2]. You stated that during your pre-employment discussions with [ABC], you brought to the attention of [ABC management] the restrictions imposed on former City employees by the post-employment provisions of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance. You stated  that  all  matters  relating  to  [ABC’s]  work  at  [Facility  1]  are  being  handled  by  [ABC management team members other than you]. In addition, you stated that [ABC’s] executive team, consisting  of  the  Vice  Presidents  and  the  CEO,  have  all  been  advised  of  the  Ordinance’s  post- employment restrictions and have been directed to take up all [City Department U] matters with [two particular ABC officers].   LAW:   Section 2-156-100 of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance (Post-Employment Restrictions) states:  (a) No former official or employee shall assist or represent any person other than the City in any judicial or administrative proceeding involving the City or any  of  its  agencies,  if  the  official  or  employee  was  counsel  of  record  or participated personally and substantially in the proceeding during his term of office or employment.   (b)  No  former  official  or  employee  shall,  for  a  period  of  one  year  after  the termination of the official's or employee's term of office or employment, assist or represent any person in any business transaction involving the City or any of  its  agencies,  if  the  official  or  employee  participated  personally  and substantially in the subject matter of the transaction during his term of office or employment; provided, that if the official or employee exercised contract management  authority  with  respect  to  a  contract  this  prohibition  shall  be permanent as to that contract.  “Assisting” and “representing” a person in business transactions involving the City include helping a person to seek, as well as perform, a contract. Case No. 89119.A.  “Assisting” and “representing” also  include  activities  such  as  rendering  advice,  appearing  before  any  City  commission,  board, department or agency, negotiating contracts, or preparing or submitting documents on behalf of that person.  Case No. 89144.A.  Further, the one-year prohibition under Section 2-156-100(b) begins on the date the employee’s or official’s City employment or term of office terminates, not on the date that he or she stopped performing particular tasks. Case No. 94011.A.     ANALYSIS: You have asked the Board to address how your former service as Commissioner [of Department U] affects your present ability, and that of [ABC],  to participate in: 1) [Contract 1 and Contract 2] and 2) business transactions involving the City’s [facility] system generally.   Case No. 04058.A January 12, 2005 Page 5  Permanent Prohibitions.  Sub-Section 2-156-100(a).  We first address the permanent prohibitions.  Under sub-section 2-156- 100(a), you are permanently prohibited from assisting or representing any person other than the City in any judicial or administrative proceeding involving the City if you participated personally and substantially in the proceeding as a City employee.5   Sub-Section  2-156-100(b).    Under  the  second  clause  of  sub-section  2-156-100(b),  you  also  are permanently prohibited,  after leaving City service, from assisting or representing any person other than  the  City  on  a  contract  over  which  you  exercised  contract  management  authority  as  a  City employee.  Section 2-156-010(g) defines the term “contract management authority” as “personal involvement  in  or  direct  supervisory  responsibility  for  the  formulation  or  execution  of  a  City contract,  including  without  limitation  the  preparation  of  specifications,  evaluation  of  bids  or proposals, negotiation of contract terms or supervision of performance.”    As to [Contract 1],  you stated that you reviewed and approved the scope of services for the RFP developed by [a Department U Managing Deputy]; although you were not part of the City team that reviewed and scored responses to the RFP, you did review and approve the  team’s contract-award recommendations; and although you did not participate in contract negotiations, you did recommend negotiation and execution of an agreement with [Contractor 1] to the City’s Chief Procurement Officer.    As to [Contract 2],  you stated that you reviewed the scope of services for the RFQ developed by [a Department U Managing Deputy]; although you were not part of the City team that reviewed and scored  responses  to  the  RFQ,  you  did  review  and  approve  the    team’s  contract-award recommendations; and although you did not participate in contract negotiations, you did recommend negotiation and execution of an agreement with [Contractor 2] to the City’s Chief Procurement Officer. You stated that, as [Commissioner of Department U], you also participated in Department discussions on how to apportion work between [Contractor 2] and another Department contractor.    Based on your involvement in, and responsibility for, [Contract 1 and Contract 2], as described by you,  the Board concludes that you exercised contract management authority over both contracts. Therefore, the Board determines that under subsection 2-156-100(b) of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance, you are permanently prohibited upon leaving City service from assisting or representing [ABC,  Inc.],  or  any  other  person  other  than  the  City,  on  either  [Contract  1  or  Contract  2].   5Because you are not an attorney, that part of sub-section 2-156-100(a) which relates to proceedings in which a former employee was “counsel of record” has no application to your situation.  Case No. 04058.A January 12, 2005 Page 6  One-Year Prohibition.   Subsection  2-156-100(b).    We  next  address  the  one-year  prohibition.  Under  the  first  clause  of subsection 2-156-100(b), you are prohibited, for one year after leaving City service, from assisting or representing any person in a business transaction involving the City, if you participated personally and substantially in the subject matter of that transaction as a City employee.   As the Commissioner [of Department U], you had overall and ultimate responsibility for the City’s [facility] system  which, at that time, included three [facilities]: [Facility 1, Facility 2 and Facility 3]. Your responsibilities included overseeing the various functions within [that facility system] such as [facility]  operations, maintenance, planning, finance, capital projects, security and [certain other functions]. Based on your duties as Commissioner, the Board concludes that you were personally and substantially involved in the operation, maintenance and development of the City’s [facility] system. Therefore, the Board determines that, under subsection 2-156-100(b) of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance, you are prohibited for one year from the date you left City service, that is, until [DATE], from assisting or representing [ABC, Inc.], or any other person other than the City, on any business transaction involving the operation, maintenance or development of the City’s [facility] system, including but not limited to [Facility 1 and Facility 2].     DETERMINATIONS:  In  summary,  after  careful  consideration  of  the  facts  presented  and  the relevant law, the Board has determined that:  1.  under  subsection  2-156-100(a)  of  the  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance,  you are permanently prohibited from assisting or representing [ABC Inc.], or any other person other than the City, in any judicial or administrative proceeding involving the City or any of its agencies, if you participated personally and substantially in the proceeding during your tenure as a City employee;  NOTE: You have not identified any judicial or administrative proceeding which you wish the Board to address in this opinion. The Board notes that, based on the nature of the various posts you occupied during your years of City service [ as                             and as                                         ], it is possible that you participated personally and substantially  in  judicial  or  administrative  proceedings  involving  the  City.    If,  in  the future, you have a question as to whether you are permanently prohibited from assisting [ABC  Inc.],  or  any  other  person,  in  some  judicial  or  administrative  proceeding,  you should contact the Board for specific guidance;      2. under  subsection  2-156-100(b)  of  the  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance,  you  are permanently prohibited  from assisting or representing [ABC, Inc.], or any other person other than the City, on any City contract over which you exercised contract management authority during your tenure as a City employee. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to: (i) [Contract 1] and (ii) [Contract 2];        Case No. 04058.A January 12, 2005 Page 7  NOTE: In this opinion, the Board has addressed 2 specific [Department U] contracts that you  identified.    The  Board  notes  that,  based  on  the  nature  of  the  various  posts  you occupied during your years of City service [as               and as                  ], you likely exercised contract management authority over other City contracts.    If,  in  the  future,  you  have  a  question  as  to  whether  you  are  permanently prohibited from assisting [ABC, Inc.], or any other person, on some other City contract, you should contact the Board for specific guidance;      3. under  subsection  2-156-100(b)  of  the  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance,  you  are prohibited for one year from the date you left City service, that is, until [DATE], from assisting or representing [ABC, Inc.], or any other person other than the City, on any  business  transaction  involving  the  City  if  you  were  personally  and  substantially involved in the subject matter of the transaction during your tenure as a City employee. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, assisting or representing [ABC, Inc.], or any other person other than the City, on any business transaction involving the operation, maintenance or development of the City’s [facility] system, including but not limited to [Facility 1 and Facility 2].   NOTE: In this opinion, the Board has addressed business transactions involving the City’s [facility] system. The Board notes that, based on the nature of the various posts you occupied during your years of City service  [ as                              and as                                        ], you likely  participated personally and substantially in the subject matter of other businesses transactions involving the City.  If, in the future, you have a question as to whether you are prohibited until [DATE], from assisting or representing [ABC, Inc.],  or  any  other  person  other  than  the  City,  on  some  other  business  transaction involving the City, you should contact the Board for specific guidance; and   4. FINAL  NOTE:  With  regard  to  both  the  Ordinance’s  permanent  and  one-year prohibitions,  the  Board  notes  that  these  restrictions,  detailed  above,  apply  to  you, personally as a former City employee. They do not apply to your new employer, [ABC, Inc.] generally. Therefore, [ABC, Inc.] may assist and/or represent persons whom you, personally, are prohibited from assisting or representing, so long as you do not assist [ABC, Inc.], its owners, officers or employees in any way on those matters. However, should your conduct not conform to the restrictions detailed above, that is, should you assist [ABC, Inc.] (or any other person other than the City) on a City contract in violation of the Ordinance’s post-employment provisions, it could result in the voiding of that contract by the City pursuant to Section 2-156-430 of the Ordinance.   Further,  we  advise  you  that  Section  2-156-070  of  the  Ethics  Ordinance,  “Use  or  Disclosure  of Confidential  Information,”  prohibits  you  from  using  or  disclosing  any  confidential  information gained  in  the  course  of  your  City  employment.    “Confidential  information”  is  defined  as  any information that may not be obtained pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.  Case No. 04058.A January 12, 2005 Page 8  Our determinations do not necessarily dispose of all issues relevant to this situation, but are based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify the Board immediately, as any change may alter our opinion.  Other laws or rules  may also apply to this situation.  Additionally, should the facts presented change, you should contact the Board for further review of the matter.  RELIANCE: This opinion may be relied upon by (1) any person involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered and (2) any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.  ________________________ Darryl L.
