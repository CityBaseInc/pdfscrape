Starting in early April, the Department of Water Management’s private contractor will  install 1,400 feet of 24-inch, 30-inch, and 36-inch new sewer main in S. Langley Avenue  (40th Street-Oakwood Boulevard), and in E. Oakwood Boulevard (Langley Avenue- Vincennes Avenue). The old sewer dates back to 1889 and needs to be replaced.     For a period of time, eastbound traffic on Oakwood Boulevard will be closed at S. Vincennes  Avenue. Vehicular traffic will be detoured from Vincennes north to Pershing, east to  Cottage Grove, and back to Oakwood Boulevard. Our contractor will provide and maintain  access for local and emergency vehicles during the construction period. Otherwise, when   working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business. Outside of working hours, a travel lane will  be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    3rd Ward Office: 773-373-9273    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Thomas Powers  Commissioner

This  includes  providing  the  very  best  advice  and  counseling  with  respect  to  contracts,  real  estate  and  other  transactions,  proposed  and  actual  legislation,  and  policy  initiatives,  and  the  very  best  representation  in  negotiations  and  in  litigation,  regulatory  and  other  proceedings.  The  Corporation  Counsel  and  the  Law  Department  will  provide  such  counseling  and  representation  with  the  goal  of  furthering  and  protecting  the  financial  and  other  interest,  and  the  public  safety,  of  the  City  and its citizens, and anticipating and avoiding and/or minimizing  the  City’s  exposure  to  adverse  financial  and  other  effects,  including adverse legal rulings, judgments and awards.    Reducing Legal Costs     II.      During  the  past  year,  the  Law  Department  has  continued  to  implement  a  number  of  initiatives  to  reduce  the  City’s  legal  costs.    This  includes making an early assessment whether cases should be settled or  tried  and  paying  increased  attention  to  risk  management  (correcting  and  avoiding City practices and/or omissions that lead to lawsuits). In addition,  we have continued – and built on the prior successes of – our efforts: to  reduce outside legal costs by bringing more legal work in-house; to enlist  some of the City’s leading lawyers and law firms to represent the City at no  or  reduced  cost  pursuant  to  the  pro  bono  program  I  initiated  when  the  current administration first took office in 2011; and to try – and win – non- meritorious  cases,  and  thereby  reduce  the  number  of  new  cases  (particularly  police  cases)  filed  against  the  City.  I  briefly  address  each  of  these efforts below.     A.  Early Assessment       In last year’s budget statement, I recounted how, historically, the City  had often avoided making the hard decisions as to whether a case should  be settled until years after it was filed and on the eve of trial or an adverse      2   court  ruling.  This  was  particularly  true  with  respect  to  difficult  and  high- exposure cases. This increased the cost to taxpayers in two ways:       First, most of the City’s higher-exposure cases are brought under  federal  statutes  that  provide  that  the  City  is  liable  for  plaintiff’s  attorney’s fees if the City loses at trial.  Accordingly, when the City  loses  or  settles  such  a  case,  it  is  liable  not  only  for  plaintiff’s  damages,  but  also  its  attorney’s  fees.  This  is  in  addition  to  any  fees the City has paid to its own attorneys if the case was referred  to outside counsel, which many of these cases were.        Second,  in many  cases, the  City’s  exposure  –  and  the  damages  sought  by  the  plaintiff  –  increase  the  longer  a  case  remains  pending. This is primarily because the plaintiff discovers additional  evidence supporting its claims or the court makes pretrial rulings  that  strengthen  its  case.  In  addition,  in  many  cases  plaintiffs  are  willing to settle for less if they are paid promptly.     In particular, when the current administration took office in May 2011,    it inherited a large backlog of cases that were awaiting trial and which the  attorneys  handling  the  case  advised  that  the  City  was  likely  to  lose  and  recommended settling.  Most of these cases had been pending for years  and, due to attorney’s fees, the cost of settling was triple or more what it  would  have  been  if  an  earlier  settlement  had  been  reached.    In  order  to  avoid these increased costs going forward, it was critical that we develop a  new approach.      At my direction, the Law Department instituted a new policy whereby  cases  are  investigated  and  evaluated  promptly  after  they  are  filed.    A  determination is then made whether the case is one that should be tried or  settled, and if settled, the settlement value of the case.  If the City is likely  to  lose  the  case,  and  further  litigation  would  only  increase  the  City’s  exposure  by  generating  attorney’s  fees  that  we  would  ultimately  be  responsible for, we will attempt to settle the case at an amount at or below  the  estimated  value  of  the  case.    If  a  reasonable  settlement  cannot  be  reached, then the City knows it has to try the case.  On the other hand, if  the  City  believes  it  has  a  reasonable  prospect  of  winning,  or  if  further  litigation is likely to reduce the City’s exposure, we will aggressively defend  and, if necessary, try the case.         3     I  am  pleased  to  report  that  our  early  assessment  strategy  has  achieved  significant  cost  savings  for  taxpayers.    As  illustrated  in  the  following  chart,  by  promptly  evaluating  and  moving  to  settle  the  most  difficult cases before potential damages and attorneys’ fees skyrocket, we  estimate that taxpayers have saved at least $34 million from the projected  costs if these cases had been settled on the eve of trial or tried.

Based  on  past  experience  in  similar  cases, our attorneys estimate that, if the City had not settled these cases  promptly after filing, but instead followed its historical approach of waiting   Estimated Percentage Savings - 69%      4      until shortly before trial to assess whether to settle or try these cases, the  damages and attorneys’ would have totaled $49 million.  Utilizing our early  assessment  strategy,  the  City  was  able  to  settle  these  cases  for  $15.3  million,  including  attorneys’  fees  and  costs,  which  represents  a  69%  savings from the projected costs.       One final note. Although Law’s early assessment policy applies to all  cases filed against the City, the chart above is limited to police cases. And,  even as to police cases, it does not include all cases that have been settled  pursuant  to  Law’s  early  assessment  policy  and  the  resulting  savings.  Accordingly, we believe this is a conservative estimate of the savings from  this initiative.    B.  Risk Management       Another  initiative  that  continues  to  show  promising  results  is  DOL’s    collaboration with other City departments with respect to risk management.  This  includes  identifying  circumstances  that  can  lead,  or  have  led,  to  lawsuits in order to take steps to prevent them from recurring in the future.   At bottom, there is no better way to reduce the City’s legal expenses than  to reduce the risk that a lawsuit will be filed in the first place; the cheapest  lawsuit to defend is one that is never filed.       One  recent  example  of  both  Law’s  early  assessment  and  risk  management  strategies  is  a  class  action  case  involving  female  firefighter  candidates that was settled in September. In that case, Vasich, et al v. City  of  Chicago,  plaintiffs  alleged  that  the  Fire  Department’s  physical  aptitude  test for new hires discriminates against women.  In many respects, Vasich  was  similar  to  the  Lewis  case  brought  by  African-American  firefighter  applicants  that  the  City  litigated  for  17  years  and  lost  shortly  before  the  current administration took office, and which has cost the city $74 million in  damages and attorney’s fees to date. Vasich could have resulted in similar  exposure if the problems it revealed had not been proactively addressed by  the  Law  Department  working  in  tandem  with  the  Fire  Department.  In  Vasich, rather than embark on such a protracted and expensive legal battle  with an uncertain outcome, we adopted a litigation strategy that eliminated  future exposure, limited the past damages the putative class could claim,   and offered the Fire Department a unique opportunity to increase gender  diversity.          5     The case was based on the CFD’s use of the Physical Abilities Test,  or PAT, for hiring entry level firefighters.  Since CFD started using this test  in  1996,  93%  of  male  applicants  have  passed,  while  an  average  of  only  19%  of  females  did  so.  Based  on  these  differential  test  results,  it  was  undisputed that the PAT had an adverse impact on female PAT test-takers.        While some differential in pass/fail rates for physical abilities testing is  expected  due  to  physiological  differences  between  men  and  women,  the  law  requires  that  an  employer  ensure  that  any  differences  are  truly  job  related and that there is no alternative test available that is equally valid but  results in less adverse impact.    Shortly after the filing of the Vasich complaint, the City identified such    an alternative test – the Candidate Physical Abilities Test (“CPAT”).  CPAT  is a nationally-recognized physical abilities test for the entry level firefighter  position that is used by hundreds of fire departments nationwide, including  all but one of the 10 largest fire departments in the country, and more than  80 municipalities in Illinois.  CPAT was developed in cooperation with the  International  Association  of  Firefighters,  the  largest  trade  association  of  firefighter  unions  in  the  country,  and  has  been  sanctioned  by  the  U.S.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Most importantly, 50% of all  women pass the CPAT, approximately 2½ times the pass rate for the PAT.        In  short,  the  Vasich  suit  posed  a  substantial  risk  to  taxpayers  because  another  less  discriminatory  and  equally  valid  alternative,  the  CPAT, was widely available but not even considered by the CFD when the  PAT was last modified in 2006.        The  Law  Department  moved  swiftly  after  becoming  aware  of  the  CPAT test.  First, it recommended – and the Fire Department agreed – to  forego  the  PAT  and  instead  adopt  CPAT.  This  proactive  step  greatly  reduced  the  City’s  potential  exposure  and  eliminated  entirely  any  future  claims arising from CFD’s use of an allegedly discriminatory test.        We then made an initial settlement offer in November 2011, just four  months after the Vasich complaint was filed. This offer included use of the  CPAT test going forward and the opportunity for class members to retake  the  physical  abilities  test  using  CPAT  and,  if  they  passed,  enter  the  academy, provided they successfully completed CFD’s other screening and  testing  requirements.    When  this  offer  was  rejected  due  to  what  we  believed to be plaintiffs’ excessive demands for past damages, we filed a      6     As  discussed  above,  when  the  current  administration  took  office  in  mid-2011,  it  inherited  a  large  backlog  of  police  shooting,  reversed  conviction, and other serious exposures that had been pending for years.  Over the past 2 ½ years, we have made significant progress in eliminating  this backlog, both through trials and settlements. This is illustrated by the  following chart, which shows the percentage of settlements and judgments  in the last three years that related to cases that the current administration  inherited when it took office in May 2011.      Percentage of Total Judgments and Settlements    That Relate to Cases Filed Before 6/11   2011-2013   100.00%  100.00%  90.00%  80.00%  70.00%  60.00%  50.00%  40.00%  30.00%  20.00%  10.00%  0.00%  88.71%  64.88%  2011  2012  2013     All of the settlements and judgments the City paid in 2011 related to cases  that predated  the current administration.  In  2012,  89%  of  the  settlements  and judgments paid related to such legacy exposures. And, even this year,  almost two-thirds of the total amount paid by the City for settlements and  judgments (65%) related to cases the current administration inherited.       At  the  same  time,  pursuant  to  the  current  administration’s  early  assessment  initiative,  serious  exposures  filed  since  May  2011  are  being  assessed, and where it is in the best interest of taxpayers, settled, promptly  after they are filed. As a result, not only has the total number of pending  cases declined, but the number of serious exposures included within those  pending cases has declined. This should result in a reduction in the amount      10

Daley, Mayor      April 16, 2010   Chicago Department of Public Health  Bechara Choucair, MD, Commissioner   Figure 1. Reported number of hospitalizations associated with  confirmed or presumptive pandemic influenza A (H1N1), Chicago,  by week of specimen collection, April 2009—April 2010     What is the risk?  As of April 16, 2010, the risk of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection in Chicago remains low. Despite several  months of minimal influenza activity, the Board of Health’s Emergency Reporting Requirement1 is still in effect  for Chicago hospitals, as well as for Chicago laboratories performing influenza subtyping tests.  All Chicagoans  aged six months and older are encouraged to protect themselves from infection by getting vaccinated with the pan- demic influenza vaccine. Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.   For those without healthcare providers or whose healthcare providers do not have vaccine, vaccines are available at  City of Chicago Fast Track Immunization clinics  and neighborhood health centers; hours and loca- tions are available by calling 311.    Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   No hospitalizations associated with pandemic in- fluenza A (H1N1) have been reported in Chicago  residents for surveillance week 14 (April 4 – April  10, 2010) (figure 1).     How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   With 15 Chicago hospitals reporting, 3.2% of  emergency department visits were due to influ- enza-like illness (i.e. fever of 100°F or greater,  with cough or sore throat). In both pediatric hos- pitals and hospitals serving adults, rates have de- creased to the levels that were reported in Sep- tember 2009 (figure 2). Among four outpatient  clinics reporting for the week of April 4 – April  10, 2010, 1.0% of doctor’s office visits were due  to influenza-like illness.  This level of activity is  lower than levels seen during the same surveil- lance week during previous influenza seasons.    Which influenza strains are circulating?   For the week of April 4 – April 10, 2010, with  seven local laboratories reporting, five influenza  A-positive specimens for which subtyping was  performed were reported as presumptive pan- demic influenza A (H1N1).  No seasonal influ- enza A or influenza B strains were reported.     Where can I get more information?        The February edition of CDPH’s CD Info newsletter2 provides supplemental information about the surveillance and  investigation of the 2009 pandemic in Chicago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s FluView3 report  provides national updates and trends related to the intensity of influenza activity across the United States, as well as  detailed information on antiviral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics. Updates specific to Illinois4 and  Suburban Cook County5 are also available online.    1 https://www.chicagohan.org/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=28960&folderId=24345&name=DLFE-95.pdf  2 http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/infectious_disease/Communicable_Disease/IP_CDInfo_FEB2010_PandemicFlu.pdf  3http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/; 4 http://www.idph.state.il.us/flu/fluupdate09-10.htm; 5 http://www.cookcountypublichealth.org/flu_current_situation   Figure 2.

Weekly reported percent of emergency department visits  attributed to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current  season (2011-2012) and previous season, October-May.   What is the risk?  Currently, the risk of influenza infection is low.  From May-September 2011, the vast majority of influenza viruses  characterized by CDC were closely related to those found in the current 2011-2012 influenza vaccine.  Vaccination is  the best way to protect against influenza infection and all Chicagoans aged six months and older are encouraged to  get vaccinated. Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  The City of  Chicago will be offering free flu shots on Saturday, October 29th at Kennedy King and Truman Colleges and on  Saturday, November 5th at Arturo Velasquez Institute, Wright and Daley Colleges.  A complete schedule of  City of Chicago influenza vaccine clinics1 is available on the City website and by calling 311.    Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   No influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were  reported for week 42 (October 16-22, 2011).  Sus- pected novel influenza, pediatric influenza- associated deaths, influenza-associated ICU hospi- talizations and outbreaks of influenza-like illness in  a congregate setting should all be reported to CDPH  via INEDSS2.         How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   For the week of October 16-22, 2011, with 16 hos- pitals reporting, 3.5% of emergency room visits  were due to ILI (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with  cough or sore throat). This is similar to levels re- ported during the same surveillance week in 2010  (Figure 1).  Several outpatient clinics throughout  Chicago participate in the Influenza-like Illness Net- work (ILINet) by reporting the percentage of clinic- visits due to ILI.  From October 16-22, 2011, with  15 outpatient clinics reporting, 1.6% of outpatient  clinic visits were due to ILI.  This is similar to lev- els reported during the same surveillance week in  2010 for both Chicago and Illinois (Figure 2).       Which influenza strains are circulating?   Data on influenza virus test results are reported by  Chicago laboratories performing influenza subtyp- ing. For the week of October 16-22, 2011, with 3  laboratories reporting, none of the 106 specimens  tested for influenza were positive.     Where can I get more information?   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s       FluView3 report provides national updates and  trends related to the intensity of influenza activity  across the United States, as well as detailed infor- mation on antiviral resistance, severity of illness,  and other topics.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,283 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Kimball Avenue, from  W. Diversey Avenue to W. Fullerton Avenue, W. Altgeld Street, from N. Kimball Avenue to N.  Spaulding Avenue, W. Schubert Avenue, from N. St. Louis Avenue to N. Kimball Avenue, and  W. Drummond Place, from N. St. Louis Avenue to N. Kimball Avenue. The old pipe dates back  to 1891, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Maldonado’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Roberto Maldonado               26th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         Do you wonder what was happening in 1891?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                    Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap      and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.                      KIMBALL AVE., ALTGELD ST., SCHUBERT AVE. & DRUMMOND PL.     WATER PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,283 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Kimball Avenue, from W. Diversey Avenue to W. Fullerton Avenue, W.  Altgeld Street, from N. Kimball Avenue to N. Spaulding Avenue, W. Schubert Avenue, from N.  St. Louis Avenue to N. Kimball Avenue, and W. Drummond Place, from N. St. Louis Avenue to  N. Kimball Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe consist of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further the old  main dates back to 1891 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in late December 2014. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Kimball Avenue, W. Altgeld Street, W. Schubert  Avenue and W. Drummond Place outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the  street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your  home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a  lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                                           CONTACT NUMBERS   ALDERMAN ROBERTO MALDONADO   773-395-0143       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  December 2014. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015. We always hesitate to promise  specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere  in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
