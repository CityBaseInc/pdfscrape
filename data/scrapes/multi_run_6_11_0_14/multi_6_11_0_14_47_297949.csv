I want to  be certain you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to  call if you have any questions or concerns.    Our crews will soon be installing 949 feet of 12-inch water main in N. LaSalle Dr.  (W. Chicago Ave. to W. Grand Ave.). The old main dates back to 1895 and needs  to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Reilly’s office, and he has made clear we are  to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project.  Good communications is the  key.    I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely.  We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.    If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.      Thank you for your understanding and good will.      Sincerely    Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner      cc:   Alderman Brendan Reilly       42nd Ward                                                Do you wonder what was happening in 1895?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                  SHEMP HOWARD        The first professional football game was played.    Wilhelm Roentgen (Germany) discovered a form of radiation later known as X-rays.    Shemp Howard of The Three Stooges was born.    The term “Salisbury Steak” was used for the first time; the dish was named after Dr.   James Henry Salisbury, who advocated eating beef three times a day for health benefits.     The first female PhD (science) was earned by Caroline Willard Baldwin.    Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prize.    The world’s first movie theater opened in Paris, France.                  PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 949 feet of 12-inch water main in  N. LaSalle Dr. (W. Chicago Ave. to W. Grand Ave.).     Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1895 and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Water main installation is anticipated to begin early May with completion of this  project projected for late June. Restoration (to be completed by the Chicago Department of  Transportation) will follow. This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected  developments in the street, or other circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our  schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. LaSalle Dr. without interruption, but we will have  to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1   ALDERMAN BRENDAN REILLY   312-642-4242   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                     FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June.  Restoration (to be completed by the Chicago Department of Transportation) will follow. We  always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather  and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

The view to the east provides an impressive panorama of dozens of parallel lines of train tracks and the triangular shaped wetland on the right. In the distance is the downtown skyline.  Down on the ground are large stands of common reed (Phragmites) and teasel, two invasive plants. The ecological quality of the native plant community within the wetland is low quality, but a survey of amphibians and reptiles would be worthwhile. Since the site is difficult to reach by foot or any other manner, wildlife suffers little disturbance from humans.  O R E C C  I  CICERO WETLANDS   The site is part of the Greater Southwest  Chicago Industrial Corridor. On the land south  of the site is a remote parking lot for Midway Airport. The wetland and its restoration could be part of a stormwater management design if this land is developed.  Belt Railroad owns the property, though there  are a number of encumbering easements on it, including one from Com Ed for maintenance of utility lines. As of this writing, no plans are in place for either the property's development or its sale.

After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,081 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Homewood Avenue, from  W. Edmaire Street to W. 115th Street. The old pipe dates back to 1910, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman O’Shea’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Matthew O’Shea               19th Ward      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                Do you wonder what was happening in 1910? That’s the year the old water main was  installed beneath your street. Among other things:           MOTHER TERESA                    Mother Teresa was born.    Comiskey Park, Home of the Chicago White Sox, opened.    Father’s Day was celebrated for the first time.    The Hallmark Cards company was founded.    The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated and chartered.    The first radio contest was held, in Philadelphia.    Alva Fisher patented the electric washing machine.                           WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,081 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Homewood Avenue, from W. Edmaire Street to W. 115th Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1910 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in April. Final restoration will follow in May. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN MATTHEW O’SHEA   773-238-8766                        FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in April. Final  restoration will follow in May. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.

Albany, Chicago, Illinois.  The charges against the licensee   were:                     1.         2.   3.   That on or about December 11, 2009, the licensee corporation was    involuntarily dissolved and the licensee ineligible to hold a City of    Chicago Retail Liquor License pursuant to Title 4, Chapter 60, Section   030(l) of the Municipal Code of Chicago.    That on or about December 11, 2009, the licensee corporation was  involuntarily dissolved and the licensee is therefore ineligible to hold a  City of Chicago Retail Liquor License pursuant to 235 ILCS 5/6-2  (a)(10a).    That the licensee corporation failed to notify in writing the Director of  Revenue of the City of Chicago of the addition of a manager to the  licensed premises within ten (10) days of the effective date of such  change, in violation of Title 4, Chapter 60, Section 040(k) of the  Municipal Code of Chicago.     1                 4.       That on or about August 17, 2010, the licensee, after reasonable notice,   failed to make books and records available during an investigation, in   violation of 235 ILCS 5/6-10.      This matter proceeded to hearing before Deputy Hearing Commissioner Raymond   J. Prosser on February 11, 2011, March 24, 2011, and April 28, 2011.  Assistant   Corporation Counsel Rachel Berger represented the City, and attorney John Mraibie of   the Law Offices of Akram Zanayed and Associates represented the licensee.          Deputy Hearing Officer Prosser entered Findings of Fact that the City proved by a   preponderance of the evidence Charges 1 through 3, but did not prove that Charge 4 was   sustained.  He further found revocation to be the proper penalty on each of the Charges 1,   2, and 3.  Gregory Steadman, as the Local Liquor Control Commissioner, and Norma   Reyes, as Commissioner of the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection   adopted the Findings of Fact of the Deputy Hearing Commissioner as those of the   Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection.  The licensee filed a timely   Notice of Appeal with this Commission.          With respect to Charges 1 and 2, City’s Exhibit 5 was allowed in evidence   without objection.  It is a certified document that the 2256 Club, Inc., was involuntarily   dissolved by the Secretary of State’s Office on December 11, 2009.  Title 4, Chapter 60,   Section 030(l) of the Chicago Municipal Code and 235 ILCS 5/6-2 (a)(10a) require   corporate licensee to be in good standing.  Since the corporation was involuntarily   dissolved on December 11, 2009, the corporation was not in good standing and could not      2   hold a City of Chicago or State of Illinois license.  The findings that the City met its   burden of proof in Charges 1 and 2 are supported by substantial evidence in light of the   whole record.          With respect to Charge 3, there was a stipulation between the parties that a   manager’s statement under Title 4, Chapter 60, Section 040(k) was never filed by the   licensee corporation.  There was no stipulation that a manager’s statement was required,    as there was no stipulation that a manager was on the premises or that a manager had   been hired.  This section requires that any change in the information required to be   provided by 4-60-040(b) must be reported to the Department of Business Affairs and   Consumer Protection within ten days of the change.          It is the position of the licensee corporation that there is not substantial evidence   in the record as a whole to prove a manager was ever hired or on the premises.  That   would nullify any reporting requirement.          Mr. Rafael Pereda testified his father Rafael Pereda, Sr., was the president of the   licensee corporation.  After his father passed away on February 7, 2007, he was   appointed executor of his father’s estate.  He identified Licensee’s Exhibit 1, as a court   order dated September 29, 2008, and signed by Judge James Kennedy the right to   continue operating the corporation until such time or the City of Chicago approves the   change of officer application.  Mr. Pereda stated has been running the business since that   date.       3      This evidence is sufficient for the City to have met its burden that there is   substantial evidence in the record as a whole that Rafael Pereda was acting as a manager   of the licensee corporation since at least September 29, 2008.  That evidence combined   with stipulation that no manager’s statement was ever filed is sufficient evidence to   affirm the Finding of Fact on Count 3.  If a reviewing court were to feel otherwise, the   affirming of the Findings of Fact on Counts 1 and 2 are sufficient to serve as the bases for   revocation.          The decision of the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection and   the Local Liquor Control Commission is affirmed.  The liquor license issued to the 2256   Club, Inc., is revoked.                                           4   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the order revoking the   liquor license of the APPELLANT is AFFIRMED.    Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a petition for rehearing may be filed  with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the  mailing of this order is deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an  administrative review action in the Circuit Court, the petition for rehearing must be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order as such petition is a  jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

I want to  be certain you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to  call if you have any questions or concerns.    Our crews will soon be installing 1,153 feet of 8-inch water main in E. 21st St. (S.  Michigan Ave. to S. Calumet Ave.) and 918 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Prairie  Ave. (E. Cullerton St. to E. Cermak Rd.). The old mains date back to 1875 and  needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Fioretti’s office, and he has made clear we are  to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project.  Good communications is the  key.    I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely.  We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.    If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.        Sincerely    Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner      cc:   Alderman Robert Fioretti       2nd Ward   Do you wonder what was happening in 1875? That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                                                                          OUTLAW JESSE JAMES        The world’s first roller skating rink opened in London.    American thoroughbred racehorse Aristides won the first Kentucky Derby.    Bizet’s opera “Carmen” premiered in Paris.    The first organized indoor game of ice hockey was played between two pick-up teams at   the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal.     Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim the English Channel.    Jesse James robbed a train in Otterville, Missouri.    The electric dental drill was patented by George F. Green.            PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,153 feet of 8-inch water main in  E. 21st St. (S. Michigan Ave. to S. Calumet Ave.) and 918 feet of 8-inch water main in S.  Prairie Ave. (E. Cullerton St. to E. Cermak Rd.).    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1875 and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Water main installation is scheduled to begin early July, with completion  of the project anticipated for late October. This includes restoration. This, of course, is an  estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected developments in the street, or other circumstances  (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our schedules.     Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on E. 21st St. and S. Prairie Ave. without interruption, but  we will have to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude by late  October. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at  the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 8,346 feet of 12-inch water main in W. Roosevelt Road, from  S. Kolmar Avenue to S. Homan Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Chandler’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                      CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                     W. ROOSEVELT RD. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 8,346 feet of 12-inch  water main in W. Roosevelt Road, from S. Kolmar Avenue to S. Homan Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in early September 2014. This project is being coordinated with IDOT and their  department will complete all final restoration following water main construction. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Roosevelt Road outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      ALDERMAN MICHAEL D. CHANDLER   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   3-1-1   773-533-2400   312-742-1029                                                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in early  September 2014. This project is being coordinated with IDOT and their department will  complete all final restoration following water main construction. We always hesitate to promise  specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere  in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
