The developer has  provided notification of the proposed project, by certified mail, to several associations of  minority and women contractors.  A sample version of the letter and copies of the post office  receipts for the certified letters are presented as exhibits to this report.    City Residency: The developer will comply with the requirements of Chicago=s city residency  ordinance, which requires that at least half of all construction-worker hours be filled by Chicago  residents.           Permanent Jobs: The project is estimated to create 3 permanent jobs in on-site program staff  and maintenance.      VIII. COMMUNITY SUPPORT    Alderman Beale endorses the project and has provided a letter of support (see exhibits for copy).  The project has been presented to residents at several community meetings over the past five  years; and is fully supported.    IX. CONFORMANCE WITH REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLAN    The proposed project is located in the Roseland Michigan TIF Redevelopment Project Area.  The  proposed project will satisfy the following goals of the area’s redevelopment plan:     •  An improved quality of life in the project area and the surrounding community.  •  A mix of housing styles, rental costs, sale prices, and densities that meets the needs of the  Roseland and West Pullman communities, including rental and ownership opportunities  for very low, low, and moderate income residents.   •  An environment which will contribute more positively to the health, safety, and general   welfare for residents in the project area and surrounding community.   •  The elimination of the influences and manifestations of physical and economic   deterioration and obsolescence with the project area.     The implementation strategy for achieving the plan’s goals envisions the sale of City land for  residential development.  The proposed project also conforms to the plan’s land use map, which  calls for residential, commercial, and mixed use developments.      X.  CONDITIONS OF SALE    If the proposed resolution is approved by the CDC, DHED will release a public notice  announcing the proposed sale and seeking alternative developments proposals.  The public notice  will be published in one of Chicago’s metropolitan newspapers at least once for each of three  consecutive weeks.  If no responsive alternative proposals are received within 30 days of the  publishing of the first notice, the department will accept a good faith deposit from the proposed  developer, and a redevelopment agreement will be negotiated.  The redevelopment agreement  will incorporate the parameters of the proposed project as described in this staff report.    It is DHED policy that no business will be conducted with a development entity whose any   principal has outstanding municipal debts (such as unpaid parking tickets, unpaid water bills,  unpaid business licenses, and others), is in arrears of child support payments, or who is a debtor  in bankruptcy, a defendant in a legal action for deficient performance, a respondent in an  administrative action for deficient performance, or a defendant in any criminal action.          Closing of the sale of the property will not occur before the City Council has approved the  redevelopment agreement, the developer has obtained all necessary City approvals including  zoning and building permits, and the developer has presented proof of financing.  The documents  will include a development timetable.      XI. RECOMMENDATION    The Department of Housing and Economic Development has thoroughly reviewed the proposed  Project, the qualifications of the development team, the financial structure of the project, its  public benefits, and the projects’s conformance with the redevelopment area plan, and DHED  recommends that the CDC approve the sale of 17-29 E. 112th place to Marshall Davis Ministries  for development of Pullman Suites Senior Apartments, a five story, 60 unit affordable rental  apartment building for independent seniors.            EXHIBITS      Redevelopment Area Map   Neighborhood Aerial   Plat of Survey   Site Plan   Parking Site Plan  Typical Floor Plan   Front Elevation or Rendering   Green Features   Sample M/WBE Letter   Copies of M/WBE Certified Letter Receipts   Letter of Interest from funding sources   Community Letters of Support  Alderman=s Letter of Support

In late October, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 1,403 feet  of new 8-inch water main in N. Hamilton Avenue (Sunnyside-Montrose), in N. Leavitt Street  (Sunnyside-Montrose), and in W. Agatite Avenue (Leavitt-Hamilton). The old water main dates  back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    47th Ward Office: 773-868-4747    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

In  early June, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 1,289 feet of  new 8-inch water main in N. Paulina Street (Devon-Thome) and in W. Thome Avenue (Paulina- Clark). The old water main dates back to 1898, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    40th  Ward Office: 773-769-1140    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner      Genwmnot03032016

To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,809 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Calhoun Avenue, from E.  106th Street to E. 109th Street, and E. 107th Street, from S. Hoxie Avenue to S. Bensley Avenue.  The old pipe dates back to 1906, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Pope’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,809 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Calhoun Avenue, from E. 106th Street to E. 109th Street, and E. 107th Street,  from S. Hoxie Avenue to S. Bensley Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1906 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by mid March 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Calhoun Avenue and E. 107th Street outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      CONTACT NUMBERS   3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOHN POPE   773- 721-1999                                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in mid  March 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!            "

By	late	October	2015,	the	Department	of	Water	Management	(DWM)	and	Benchmark	 Construction	Company	crews	will	begin	the	work	to	install	5,480	feet	of	new	8‐inch	water	 main	in	S.	Euclid	Avenue,	from	E.	79th	Street	to	S.	South	Chicago	Avenue,	S.	Jeffery	 Boulevard,	from	E.	79th	Street	to	E.	83rd	Street,	E.	81st	Street,	from	S.	Euclid	Avenue	to										 S.	Jeffery	Boulevard	and	E.	83rd	Street,	from	S.	South	Chicago	Avenue	to	the	railroad	tracks	 to	the	west	of	S.	Chicago	Avenue.	The	old	water	main	dates	back	to	1895,	and	needs	to	be	 replaced.		 	If	you	would	like	to	receive	regular	email	updates	about	the	progress	of	the	project,	please	 go	to	www.buildinganewchicago.org	to	register	for	the	WaterALERT	program.		Simply	 enter	your	name,	email	address	and	the	project	identification	number	at	the	top	of	this	 letter.	 	By	signing	up	for	the	WaterALERT	emails,	you	will	be	notified	as	the	project	enters	each	 new	construction	phase	–	from	our	mobilization	of	equipment	onto	the	site,	to	the	 installation	of	new	pipes,	to	the	final	restoration	of	the	street.	 	When	we	are	working	in	the	street,	we	may	close	or	limit	it	to	traffic	for	safety	reasons,	but	 you	will	always	be	able	to	reach	your	home	or	business.		Outside	of	working	hours,	a	travel	 lane	will	be	left	open	for	local	traffic	only.		 	We	will	post	our	work	area	for	“No	Parking”	as	needed	during	work	hours	(generally	7am‐ 4pm).	Parking	outside	of	those	hours	will	be	allowed,	but	cars	will	need	to	be	moved	by	the	 start	of	the	next	workday.		We	will	try	to	preserve	as	much	parking	space	as	possible.	 	We	know	that	construction	always	involves	inconveniences	and	noise.

We	give	you	24‐hour	notice	when	this	is	to	happen.		However,	in	 the	event	of	an	emergency	shutdown	during	construction,	we	may	not	be	able	to	give	you	 prior	warning.	 	After	the	old	water	main	has	been	replaced	and	you	have	been	connected	to	the	new	water	 main,	please	open	all	your	water	faucets	and	hose	taps	and	flush	your	water	for	several	 minutes.		The	aerator	screens	located	at	the	tip	of	your	faucets	should	be	removed	prior	to	 flushing.		 	This	flushing	will	help	maintain	optimum	water	quality	by	removing	sediment,	rust,	or	any	 particulates	that	may	have	come	loose	from	your	property’s	water	service	line	as	a	result	of	 the	water	main	replacement.

9801`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/ParkingMeter/MeterFAQs.pdf`Success`Success`8`8`Not a fillable PDF.`"Why does the City have parking meters?  By limiting the time that a vehicle may park in a particular space, meters play a vital role  in facilitating traffic management, promoting business, and reducing congestion and  pollution.      Do all meters operate 24 hours per day?  No.  Meters are free during evenings in most places except for City parking lots and the  Loop.  Days and hours of operation should be posted on the meters.      When do I have to pay the parking meter?  Please look at the time and days of operation on the meters.  Generally meters operate  from: 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on residential streets; 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. on business streets, and 24  hours in the Loop and City parking lots.  There are, however, exceptions.  Days and  hours of operation should be posted on the meters.    Are there parking meter holidays?    Unless otherwise posted, there are no meter holidays.    Can I park at a broken parking meter?  Yes, you may park at the broken meter for free if you report it as broken within 24 hours  by calling 877.242.7901.    How do I report a broken parking meter?  Please call the 24 hour customer service line at 877.242.7901 and provide information  about the meter, including the meter ID number.  You will be provided with a  confirmation number.      How do I request a refund?  If you have had a payment issue with a parking meter and would like to request a refund,  please call 877.242.7901.  Please note that all refund requests must be made within 30  days of the original transaction date.    Where is the meter ID number?  The number is located on the meter head on a single-space meter.  On the pay and  display boxes, the meter ID number is located on the front panel.    What happens once I report a meter as broken?  All reports of broken meters are investigated promptly, most within a few hours.    Can meters be impacted when there are drastic changes in temperature including  freezing conditions?  Yes.  Similar to most on-street equipment, parking meters may experience problems  when there are drastic changes in temperature including freezing conditions.  The City of  Chicago and the parking meter concessionaire—Chicago Parking Meters, LLC— recognize that any broken meter can be an inconvenience to motorists.  The  concessionaire is committed to ensuring that each motorist has a pleasant parking  experience.  During near sub-zero temperatures, the concessionaire will maintain and  de-ice parking meters.  Problems reported to their customer service personnel are  largely addressed within an hour or two.            1  Will I get a ticket when a pay box is broken because of the cold?  Although parking enforcement personnel work during freezing conditions, they have  been instructed to verify whether a parking meter is operational before issuing any  parking meter violation. If a parking enforcement aide determines that there is a problem  at a meter, he or she is instructed to report it to the concessionaire.  Motorists parking at  a broken meter should report it by contacting the 24 x 7 customer service line at  877.242.7901.        Will I get a ticket when my windshield is covered by snow or ice?  Motorists are obligated to pay to park at a metered space regardless of the weather  conditions.  When parking at a pay box, a motorist should display his or her receipt on  the curb side of the dashboard regardless of the presence of snow or ice.      Drivers generally clear snow off their windshields prior to driving, parking, and displaying  a pay box receipt.  And parking enforcement personnel will gently brush away snow to  determine if a pay box receipt is displayed.  This protocol is not different from years past  when the City operated pay boxes in the Loop and some neighborhoods.  This protocol  is similar to how personnel have historically enforced city sticker, disabled placard,  residential permit, and expired plate violations.  Personnel may also need to brush snow  from a single space meter to determine if it is active or from a vehicle’s license plate to  capture the plate number.        Parking enforcement personnel are instructed to use discretion.  In the rare occasion  when a vehicle is covered by an excessive amount of snow or ice, it may be difficult to  determine if a pay box receipt is displayed.   In cases where a pay box receipt may be  obscured by excessive snow or ice, personnel will forego issuing a ticket.  In the  unfortunate event that a motorist receives a ticket in error, the pay and display receipt  can be used as evidence to challenge the ticket.     What happens if I get a meter violation (section 9-64-190 of the Chicago Municipal  Code) at a broken parking meter?  It is important to report any parking meter problem that you identify.  After reporting the  meter as broken, please request an in-person hearing or contest the violation by mail.   Hearing officers have access to all reports of broken meters and can access that  information when reviewing your case.    Why did I get a ticket if the meter is broken?  Enforcement personnel are trained to recognize inoperable meters.  Unfortunately, a  meter may not always be visibly broken.  If you are issued a meter violation and you feel  it was issued in error, please report it by contacting the 24 x 7 customer service line at  877.242.7901.  You will be provided a reference number.  Then contest the violation by  following the directions on the back of the ticket.  Use your reference number during your  hearing or in your correspondence.  Information about your call and the meter history will  be available to a hearing officer during the hearing.    The red light is flashing on the single space meter. What does that mean?   The red light means that time has expired and the meter requires payment.    What types of coins do the old-style meters take?   Quarters and sometimes dollar coins.        2  What types of coins do the “pay and display” boxes take?    Generally quarters and dollars, but the pay and display boxes take credit and debit cards  as well.  They also accept the East Lakeview Chamber of Commerce gift card.     What are some other benefits of pay boxes?  Pay and displays reduce clutter on sidewalks and make neighborhoods more attractive.    These smart boxes notify operators wirelessly when they require collection or are  broken.  Consequently, collection and maintenance crews need to visit meters less  often.  Travel reductions shrink the carbon footprint of collectors and mechanics and  reduce congestion.      How else are the pay boxes “green”?  These environmentally-friendly devices are solar-powered, eliminating the need to  dispose of 45,000 lithium and 9 volt batteries each year.  In addition, the pay and display  receipts are biodegradable.    If I still have time on my pay box receipt, can I use it to park at another pay box?    Yes, a great benefit of pay and displays is that they allow motorists to take unused time  with them.  For example, if a motorist parks in a neighborhood parking spot ($1.25 per  hour), he or she may use the pay and display receipt to park in another $1.25 per hour  space at a pay and display anywhere in the city as long as the receipt has not expired.   He or she cannot, however, use the $1.25 per hour receipt to park in a more expensive  area ($2.50 or $4.25 per hour).     Will a pay box allow me to prepay for time?  That depends.  Many pay and display boxes allow motorists to prepay from 8 a.m. to 10  a.m. (or later), with the earliest time being 5 a.m.  If, however, the pay and display is  located in a morning rush hour parking zone, it may not allow motorists to pre-pay for  time.      Do pay boxes protect against identity theft?  Yes, they are compliant with Payment Card Industry Security Standards.  This set of  requirements ensure that companies that process, store, or transmit credit card  information maintain a secure environment.     How do I use a pay box?  For detailed instructions, please visit cityofchicago.org/revenue and select the “About  Parking Meters” link.  Once there, select the link labeled “Pay and Display Instruction  Sheet.”  There are Spanish and Polish translations online as well.    How do I display a pay box receipt on my motorcycle or scooter?  Since motorcycles and scooters lack a dashboard, the City of Chicago ordinance  requires that the pay box receipt be displayed on the front head lamp by using the  adhesive on the back of the receipt.  A motorcycle or scooter owner should write the  license plate number on the receipt to discourage theft.  A receipt is only valid if  displayed on the motorcycle or scooter bearing that license plate number.     CPM worked closely with ABATE, the largest motorcycle lobbyist in Illinois, and  redesigned the receipt that is now being provided.  It reached out to the scooter lobby for  feedback as well in redesigning the receipt.          3  How does the pay box keep time?  In September 2009, the concessionaire successfully implemented a program that adds  up to 1 minute, 59 seconds to each initial pay-and-display purchase.  The program was  implemented to mitigate any minor time variations between the pay boxes and other  digital clocks, such as watches or those on cell phones.  Studies show that cell phones  may not properly synchronize and may keep the wrong time.  However, pay boxes are  scheduled to synchronize every night wirelessly with a central server clock – which is  synched with atomic time to ensure accuracy.      How many pay boxes will be installed?  Under the terms of an agreement with the City, the parking meter operator (Chicago  Parking Meters, LLC) must offer cashless alternatives at all meters by 2011.  The  operator, however, already replaced more than 32,000 parking meters with more than  4,100 pay boxes.  The operator assumed all of the costs of this rollout, estimated to be  between $40 and $50 million.  They will replace the pay boxes whenever necessary, but  likely at least every seven years.      How do I avoid a ticket while making a payment at a pay box?  Parking enforcement aides are instructed to look for motorists before issuing a parking  meter violation.  They are asked to determine if a motorist might be at or walking to or  from a pay box.   Unlike the old single space meters, parking enforcement aides know  when the pay box receipt has expired.  They give motorists a grace period before issuing  any violation.  In the unfortunate event that a ticket is issued in error, motorists should  contest the violation and provide a copy of the pay box receipt.    How many parking spaces can be served by a single pay box on the public way?    A maximum of 15 spaces can be served by one box.  Pay and display boxes generally  increase the number of cars that can park on a block.    Where on a block are the pay boxes placed?  On short block faces, the operator attempts to put the pay and display in the middle of  the block.  On longer blocks where two pay and displays might be installed, the goal is to  break the block up into thirds.     Are there other criteria used to determine where pay boxes should be situated?  Yes, there are a number of other factors that may impact the position of a pay and  display box.  For instance, the operator avoids placing boxes in front of a business’  entrance or neighboring gangway.  The goal is to allow for easy ingress and egress from  the business and alley.  Also, the operator tries not to place pay and display boxes in  front of restaurants that might apply for an outdoor café license.  Although the boxes can  be fairly easily moved, the operator does not want to inconvenience a business.  There  are a few other considerations, including the placement of gas and electric lines, fire  hydrants, loading zones, and other restricted parking areas. In addition, the operator  tries to make decisions based on the types of businesses being served.      Can businesses request that a pay box be moved in order to assist elderly or  disabled motorists?  The City and the operator recognize the need for parking transactions to be convenient.   There have been requests from time to time to move a pay and display box because of  the nature of the business being served.  For instance, it might be more important for a  pay and display to be situated a little closer to a rehabilitation facility or a chiropractor      4  than to other types of businesses.  Persons with disabilities may still park for free at  parking meters and, consequently, are not required to display a pay and display receipt.    Can the City change the duration of time (also know as the “period of stay”) at the  meters in front of my business or institution?  Yes.  Most meters allow for a maximum of two hours.  Two hours, though, might not be  enough for theaters, concert halls, cinemas, gyms, or schools.  You can now make  requests to extend the period of stay online.   Please visit cityofchicago.org/revenue and  select the “About Parking Meters” link.  Then select the “Business Feedback Form” to  provide information to us about the needs of your business.       Why did parking meter rates increase?  Properly priced parking meters create better turnover and availability, making locations  served by meters more popular.  However, demand for on-street parking has grown at a  faster rate than supply.  Rates have not kept pace, and under-priced meters promote  cruising for parking spaces.  Cruising ultimately leads to increased congestion, travel  time, and pollution.  Under-priced meters also subsidize automobile use at the cost of  public transportation.    What are the rates in Chicago?  Generally, the rates in 2010 were 1.25 per hour in the residential neighborhoods, $2.50  per hour in the Central Business District, and $4.25 per hour in the Loop.  In the Loop  and parking lots, the rate was reduced 50% between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m.    In 2011, in most areas of the City, representing 82% of the metered parking spaces,  rates will be $1.50 per hour.    In the Central Business District outside the Loop (Area bounded by Lake Michigan to the  East, North Avenue to the North, Halsted to the West, and Roosevelt Road to the South,  exclusive of the Loop Area), representing approximately 16% of the metered parking  spaces, rates will be $3.00 per hour.    Inside the Loop (Area bounded by Lake Michigan to the East, Wacker Drive to the North  and West, and Congress Parkway to the South), representing less than 3% of the  metered parking spaces, rates will be $5.00 per hour from 8 AM- 9 PM, $2.50 from 9 PM  – 8 AM.     What are the boundaries of the Central Business District?  The central business district is the area bounded by:  South: the south side of Roosevelt Road;  East: Lake Michigan;  North: the north side of North Avenue;  West: the west side of Halsted Street (excluding the area within the boundaries of the  Loop).    What are the boundaries of the Loop?  The Loop is the area bounded by:   On the South: the south side of Congress Parkway;  On the East: Lake Michigan;  On the North: the north side of Wacker Drive;   And on the West: the west side of Wacker Drive.      5  What is the schedule for rate increases over the next three years?  Loop (per hour): 2011: $5.00; 2012: $5.75; 2013: $6.50;  Central Business District (per hour): 2011: $3.00; 2012: $3.50; 2013: $4.00; and  Neighborhoods (per hour): 2011: $1.50; 2012: $1.75; 2013: $2.00.    What are the scheduled rate increases after 2013?  Increases are generally scheduled to track with inflation.    If I buy 2 hours of parking at a 2 hour single space meter, can I add time to the  meter later prior to the meter expiring?   If someone adds additional coins, the single space meter will add time until it tops off at  the maximum limit, whether that is 2 hours or some other duration.     What is the parking meter concession?  The concessionaire (or “Chicago Parking Meters, LLC”) paid the City of Chicago $1.156  billion.  In addition, Chicago Parking Meters, LLC, is required to maintain, upgrade, and  repair parking meters for 75 years in return for the revenue from those meters.      How was the parking meter concessionaire selected?  The City sent a request for qualifications to more than 150 infrastructure investors and  parking investors in February 2008.  Ten prospective bidders sent in responses.  Six  were deemed qualified.  Ultimately, two companies bid, and the highest bidder, Chicago  Parking Meters, LLC, was chosen on December 1, 2008.  For a detailed discussion of  the selection process, please visit cityofchicago.org/revenue and select the “About  Parking Meters” link.  Once there, select the link “Selection Process and Timeline”.    Isn’t the concession just a long-term lease?  No, the agreement between the City of Chicago and Chicago Parking Meters, LLC (or  “CPM“) represents a concession to operate the parking meter system. The agreement  requires CPM to provide “metered parking services” which includes the operation,  management, maintenance, and rehabilitation of the system, and the collection of  parking meter revenue. No interest in real estate of any kind was conveyed in any form  (sale, lease, or other). The only title received by CPM was for the existing meter  inventory, and that inventory reverts back to the City’s possession upon the agreement’s  expiration or termination.    Why is the concession to operate meters for 75 years?  Why not a shorter period?    This is a requirement of investors.  Typically, debt issued to fund infrastructure projects  is 30-year debt.  Lenders require an additional 10-year ""tail"" in case revenues don't  come in high enough to pay the debt off during the original 30-year period.  Equity  investors are able to increase their returns by refinancing debt during the term of the  concession and thus require at least an additional 10 years.  That results in a minimum  term of 50 years.  In addition, the City received strong indications from the bidders that  they would increase the up-front payment to the City if given an additional 25 years.  And  the increase is greater than the time value of money of an additional 25 years worth of  revenue.      6  Did the City get a good deal?  Yes, the City received a very good deal.  Third party financial advisors used  sophisticated modeling software to determine the likely range of bids.  They predicted  bids between $650 million and $1.2 billion for the parking meter system.  The City’s  minimum acceptable bid was $1 billion, a figure calculated to compensate for the loss of  existing meter revenues and stabilize the budget.  The best and final bid was $1.156  billion from Chicago Parking Meters, LLC, an amount at the top end of the projections.   For a detailed discussion of the valuation, please visit cityofchicago.org/revenue and  select the “About Parking Meters” link.  Once there, select the links labeled “Value”  prepared by third party financial advisor William Blair.     Why do some reports suggest that the City could have received more?  Most underestimate risks and operational costs.  Chicago Parking Meters, LLC, owns  the risk of installing equipment, escalating labor costs, fuel costs, expanded use of public  transportation, and, most importantly, changes in driving behavior.  Those risks are  significant.  For a detailed discussion of the valuation, please visit  cityofchicago.org/revenue and select the “About Parking Meters” link.  Once there, select  the links labeled “Value” prepared by third party financial advisor William Blair.       What is the difference between “reserve” and “concession” meters?  There are two types of parking meters operated by the concessionaire: reserve parking  meters and concession parking meters.  The City retains the revenues (minus an  operating expense of 15%) for reserve parking meters, while the concessionaire  receives the revenues from concession parking meters.  The City has the power to  change the status of a meter from reserve to concession, and vice versa.     What is the true-up system?  Under the agreement, the City has agreed to an initial set of scheduled rate increases,  followed by annual adjustments to the system value equal to inflation. To the extent the  City implements changes that negatively impact the meter system value, the City may be  required to compensate the concessionaire (“true up”). Similarly, if the City takes action  that increases the value of the system more than is required, the City may capture that  value. Adjustments to meter system value can be in the form of increases in rates, hours  and the number of meters.    How is the dollar amount of any true-up determined?  Each meter is different.  Not only do meters operate at different rates and hours  throughout the City, but utilization also differs depending on the area and businesses  served.  Each meter equates to a fraction of the overall system based on its rate, hours  of operation, and utilization (note: this fraction is recalibrated annually based on changes  in utilization).  When a meter is closed--or added--the total system value may be  impacted.  Comparing the fractional value to the revenue for the entire system derives  the revenue value for a particular meter.  Negative impacts are credits due to the  concessionaire.  Positive impacts are credited to the City.  Small changes are less likely  to carry a significant economic impact, especially when utilization is factored into the  analysis already.  Further, financial impacts may be mitigated by other changes to the  meter system.         Did the City bear the same financial risk before the meter concession?  Yes.  The City owns the economic impact today just as it did prior to the concession  when the removal of a parking meter reduced the City’s revenue.  Today, if the meter is      7  a reserve meter, there is still economic impact to the City’s revenue.  If the meter is a  concession meter, the closure of a meter may necessitate a payment to the  concessionaire…or it may not.    What is the process for a developer who needs to temporarily remove parking  meters?  Temporary removals usually result from commercial development projects.  The  municipal code requires developers to apply for a permit and compensate the City for  any associated loss in meter revenue.  This provision of the code predates the parking  meter concession agreement.  Money from the developers is then deposited into a  compensation fund.  That compensation fund is used to offset reductions in City revenue  (for reserve meters) or, when necessary, to compensate the concessionaire (for  concession meters).    What is the formal process for a business or developer who proposes  permanently altering the public way in a manner that would require the removal of  parking meters?  Permanent meter removals have and continue to require aldermanic approval and  passage by the City Council.  The City Council retains the authority under the  concession agreement to add and remove meters, to set rates, durations, hours and  days of operation.  When an alderman introduces an ordinance concerning parking  meters, the City reviews the potential social-economic impacts.  Initial considerations for  removing a meter include the impact on congestion, pollution, traffic control,  development, and safety.  The City also considers the economic impact.   For permanent  closures, the City may seek to offset revenue losses through the exercise of reserved  powers like adding meters.  Alternatively, the City may increase the hours or days of  operation or adjust the rates.    Does the business or developer have to pay costs for permanent removals?  There are really no costs assumed by a developer or business if the meter removal is  approved by the City Council.  As stated above, the City would have owned similar  economic risks even if the concession agreement had not been negotiated.  To date,  however, aldermen and city officials have worked closely together in an effort to avoid  negative economic impacts.  For instance, on one occasion an ordinance was  introduced to remove meters to increase sidewalk width in order to have sidewalk cafes  installed.  Passage of the ordinance would have reduced the system in service.   However, the ordinance was amended to allow for the addition of a handful of parking  meters, thereby ensuring that there was no negative impact to the City or the  businesses.      8  "

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you,  our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our private contractor will soon be installing a new sewer in N. Richmond Street, from W.  Waveland Avenue to W. Irving Park Road, and in W. Waveland Avenue, from N. Richmond  Street to N. Sacramento Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1902, and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Mell’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Richard Mell       33rd Ward        1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         Do you wonder what was happening in 1902? That’s the year the old sewer main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:         Richard J. Daley             Animal Crackers were introduced to the American public.    Theodore Roosevelt became the first American President to ride in an automobile.    The first college football bowl game, the Rose Bowl between Michigan and Stanford,   was held in Pasadena, California.     JC Penney opened its first store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming.    The Texas Oil Company, Texaco, was formed.    Denmark became the first country to adopt fingerprinting as a way to identify criminals.    Richard J. Daley was born; he served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in   1976.                               PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management’s private contractor will soon be installing a  new sewer in N. Richmond Street, from W. Waveland Avenue to W. Irving Park Road, and in  W. Waveland Avenue, from N. Richmond Street to N. Sacramento Avenue.     Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1902 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by Irving  Park on the north, Addison on the south, Francisco on the east, and Sacramento on the west will  benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work begins shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in mid-November.  Restoration of the damaged streets/parkways will follow. If the weather permits, we expect full  restoration to occur in mid to late November. Otherwise, a concrete base will be placed at the  time and the streets will be paved with asphalt in May 2013. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:   When we are working in the street, we will have closures to “through traffic”. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Safety is our first consideration.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.             CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE               ALDERMAN RICHARD MELL   773-478-8040   3-1-1            312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Mell, and others,  to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.             Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade.

Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
