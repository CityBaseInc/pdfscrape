This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 961 feet of 8-inch water main in S. May Street, from W. 48th  Street to W. 49th Street, and in W. 49th Street, from S. Racine Avenue to S. May Street. The old  pipe dates back to 1896, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Cochran’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Willie Cochran             20th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                  Do you wonder what was happening in 1896?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                       German physicist Wilhelm Rontgen announced his discovery of x-rays.    The Tootsie Roll was introduced.    The first movie theater opened, charging ten cents for admission.    The modern Olympic Games began in Athens, Greece.    The first car accident occurred, when Henry Wells hit a bicyclist in New York City.    Yosemite became a national park.    ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" was written by John Philip Sousa.                                           WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 961 feet of 8-inch water  main in S. May Street, from W. 48th Street to W. 49th Street, and in W. 49th Street, from S.  Racine Avenue to S. May Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1896 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in August. Restoration will follow in September. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN WILLIE COCHRAN   773-955-5610      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE          312-742-1029                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in August.  Restoration will be completed in September. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since  we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!      "

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,871 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Farwell Avenue, from N.  Ashland Boulevard to N. Sheridan Road, and N. Lakewood Avenue, from W. Morse Avenue to  W. Farwell Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1900, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Moore’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Joseph Moore             49th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         Do you wonder what was happening in 1900?  That’s about the time the old water main was  installed beneath your street.  Among other things:                     HAMBURGER        Hawaii became a U.S. territory.    The hamburger was created by Louis Lassing in Connecticut.    Actor Spencer Tracy was born.    The U.S. Navy’s first submarine made its debut.    The second modern Olympic Games opened in Paris, and lasted for 5 months.    L. Frank Baum wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.    The first electric bus became operational in New York City.    English handwriting experts established the art of calligraphy.                         FARWELL AVE. & LAKEWOOD AVE. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,871 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Farwell Avenue, from N. Ashland Boulevard to N. Sheridan Road, and N.  Lakewood Avenue, from W. Morse Avenue to W. Farwell Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further the old  pipe dates back to 1900 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in mid October 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Farwell Avenue and N. Lakewood Avenue outside  of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for  reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means  putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic  only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOSEPH MOORE   773-338-5796   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid October 2014.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.    Want to learn more?  http://www.cityofchicago.org/watermanagement/bfp             DEPA RTM EN T OF WATER MANAGEM EN T            C ITY  OF CHICAGO    What is MeterSave?    MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

11290`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dcd/general/housing/ARO_Enhancements_Summary.pdf`Success`Success`2`2`Not a fillable PDF.`2015 ARO Enhancements: Summary   The Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO) is triggered when development projects receive a zoning  change, City land, or financial assistance, or are a downtown PD, AND they build a residential project with  ten or more units.  10% of units are required to be affordable; 20% if financial assistance is provided.      Under the 2007 ARO, developers could meet the ARO by providing on-site units or by paying an in-lieu fee of  $100,000/required unit. Requirements were the same citywide.    The following updates to the ARO, effective beginning October 13, 2015, are estimated to generate an  anticipated 1,200 new units and $90 million over the next five years, assuming positive market conditions:     Create three zones in the city to reflect different housing markets and priorities:    o  downtown;   o  higher-income areas; and   o   low-moderate income areas   The Zone map is available online at www.cityofchicago.org/ARO.        Adjust in-lieu fees: In-lieu fees for units not provided on-site increase to $175,000 downtown and   $125,000 in higher-income areas, and are reduced to $50,000 in low-moderate income areas. In  addition, the downtown density bonus loophole has been closed, so that developers would be  required to pay the higher of their ARO or density bonus fees. Fees will be adjusted annually for  inflation, beginning in January 2018.        Require on-site units: 1/4 of the required 10% affordable units (20% if the City provides financial   assistance) are required to be provided as on-site housing units, with two exceptions:      o  Off-site option: Developers in Higher Income areas and Downtown may meet the   requirement to provide 1/4 of the required 10% affordable units (20% if the City provides  financial assistance) by building, buying, or rehabbing units off-site:      Rental projects downtown and rental or for-sale projects in higher-income areas may  build, buy, or rehab the required units with a comparable investment within two miles  of the subject properties and within the same zone or downtown;      For-sale projects downtown may build, buy, or rehab the required units with a   comparable investment anywhere in the city.     Developers pay a $5,000/unit administrative fee to access this option.   o  Buy-out for downtown for-Sale projects: For-sale projects downtown may buy out of the   on-site or off-site unit requirement by paying a $225,000 in-lieu fee per required unit.        Provide a density bonus for affordable units near transit: Projects in a Transit Served Location  (the TOD ordinance) may provide 50% or 100% of required affordable units on-site in exchange for  additional floor area.    Incentivize developers to work with the CHA: The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) or other  authorized agencies may purchase or lease ARO units; in exchange, developers pay a reduced in-lieu  fee for remaining unit obligations.              Increase the number of eligible affordable buyers by increasing the maximum income for  purchasers to 120% AMI ($91,200 for a family of four in 2015).    Increase funding to the Trust Fund: The Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund will receive 50%  of fees-in-lieu collected via the Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund, up from 40%.     The new Ordinance is effective on October 13, 2015, with fees phased in by April 2016.    www.cityofchicago.org/ARO     The new ARO will provide the following options to developers who are subject to the ARO:      2015 ARO Enhancements: Summary   Options to meet the ARO  Construct required units on-site  and pay no in-lieu fee  Place at least 1/4 of the required  10% affordable units (20% if the  City provides financial assistance)  on-site and pay a fee-in-lieu per  any remaining units   ARO Transit-Served Location  bonus  Lease or Sell Units to the CHA or  other authorized agency and  receive a $25,000 In-Lieu Fee  Reduction  Off-Site Option: within two miles  and in a higher income area  Off-Site Option: anywhere  No on-site units – with $225,000  in-lieu premium    Low-  Moderate   Income   Higher  Income   Areas: Rental   Areas: Rental  and For-Sale   and   For-Sale   Downtown:   Rental   Downtown : For-Sale   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   $50,000 in-  $125,000 in-  lieu fee   lieu fee   $175,000*  in-lieu fee   $175,000*  in-lieu fee   X         X   X   X                X   X   X         X   X      X   X**   *downtown fees will be phased in over one year: through April 15, 2016, the fee-in-lieu for downtown  projects will be $140,000  **through April 15, 2016, the in-lieu premium will be $160,000         www.cityofchicago.org/ARO

In a letter of April 3, 2000 you asked the Board of Ethics if you could accept a paid, part- time consulting position with [Alpha Corp.                               ] without violating the City of Chicago Governmental Ethics Ordinance.  You deal with [Alpha      ]  products,  specifically,  the  [Alpha      ]  [product  ],  as  the  Project Coordinator of the Department’s Chicago [Life  ] Program.  The Board has concluded  that  if  you  accept  this  offer  of  employment  with  [Alpha  ]  and continue  in  your  duties  discussed  below  as  the  Project  Coordinator  of  the Department’s [Life    ] Program, you will be in violation of  the Ordinance.  Our analysis and determination follow.  FACTS:  Your City Employment:  You have served as the Training Coordinator at the [Department 1        ] for 3 years.  Your primary responsibility is managing the training  for  the  [Place’s]  911  center.    In  addition,  you  are  the  Project Coordinator of the Chicago [Place  ] System’s life saving initiative, entitled the Chicago  [Life      ]  Program.    The  program,  you  said,  puts  into  effect  a  new concept in  life saving, called [M                                                     ]; you said that it is the first of its kind in the world.  The program was officially launched in June 1999 when the Department went from using and owning one [product         ] to using and owning seventy-one [products    ], located throughout [Places  1  &  2                                          ]. You said that the  program has  been very successful, saving nine lives in the past eight months.  Your  immediate  supervisor,  [John      ],  [Assistant                                        ]  in  the [Department 1        ], said that you have been the Project Coordinator for the [Life      ]  Program  from  its  inception.    You  conceived  the  original  idea  of increasing the use of [products    ] and making them more accessible to the public and you pursued the details –  you estimated the number of [products ] needed, determined the optimal locations for the [products ], researched the different models on the market, and wrote the specifications of the original Request  for  Proposals  (RFP)  that  resulted  in  the  Department’s  purchase  of seventy [products ].  However, [John          ] said that he negotiated the terms and made all final decisions on the contracts for purchasing and installing the [products ].  Case No. 00009.A May 17, 2000 Page 2  You said that all of the [products ] purchased in the spring of 1999 were manufactured by [Alpha]. The official name of the product is the [Saver                      ].  You also said that [Alpha] has two main competitors, [Beta                ] and [Theta     ].  Speaking of the Department’s initial purchase of seventy [products    ], [John        ] said that you advised the Department that the [Alpha] [Saver                                   ] [product      ] would best suit the Department’s needs due to the unit’s size, the fact that it was designed for use in public settings, the fact that [User 1 & 2                                   ]   [staff ] are trained to use it, and its excellent performance record.  You added that the [Saver             ] is the only model with certain  features: an Electrocardiogram (EKG) display; the ability to  measure  arrest  impediments  in  heart  rates,  which  allows  the  user  to  recognize  and  identify different levels of fibrillation, only some of which should be responded to with jolts of electricity; and operation at low-energy, meaning that it does not escalate the amount of energy administered in shocks, therefore avoiding damage to the heart muscle.  According to [John        ], the [products    ] purchased in the spring of 1999 are under a five-year warranty and City employees perform the minimal maintenance that the units require.   You said that the cabinets in which the [products    ] are kept require maintenance, and that the only maintenance that has ever been required on a [product     ] has been the replacement of pads after they are used, and the annual replacement of batteries.  You said that none of the [products    ] purchased by the [Department 1        ] have ever malfunctioned. [John               ] said that he recently issued an RFP for  the  purchase  of  replacement  batteries  and  [product        ]  pads,  and  said  that  you  wrote  the specifications for the size and the quantity of the batteries and pads.  You said the  Department did not intend to purchase more [products    ].  According to both you and [John     ], your participation in decisions about the purchase of [Alpha] products was a one-time occurrence, and neither of you anticipate that the Department will be making purchasing decisions about [Alpha] in the future.  In the event that a [product      ] is defective and needs to be replaced by the manufacturer, [John      ] said that he would be in charge of those dealings.  You did say, however, that other City departments are considering purchasing and using [products    ].  You also said that the [Department 2] had recently purchased approximately 50 [products    ] made by [Beta       ], and that you had advised them about your experience with the [Alpha] [Saver                      ] and other matters related to setting up their program.   Since the [Life     ] program began, you have managed the training for it and its day-to-day operation. You  estimated  that  you  and  your  three  assistants  have  trained  close  to  2,500  City  and  [place  ] employees on the proper use of [products    ] and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  You have written the standard operating procedures and created the training curriculum, work that has brought you into contact with the Chicago Emergency Medical Services and the American Heart Association.  You said that you sometimes speak at national and international [place   ] conferences on behalf of the Department and the City of Chicago in order to promote [M                                   ] programs.  You also mentioned that during your vacation time, compensatory time and days off, you sometimes speak at conferences such as the American Heart Association’s national conference on behalf of organizations such as the American Heart Association  and the Red Cross, in order to promote [M].  Case No. 00009.A May 17, 2000 Page 3  A related duty of your City position is offering consultation to people interested in establishing a [M     ] program similar to the Department’s – you mentioned recent consultations with the Salt Lake City [Place   ], the San Francisco [Place], the City of Dallas, and the [Department 2] of the City of Chicago.  Finally, as the Project Coordinator, you supervise the weekly security checks done on all [products    ], and stay abreast of maintenance, which in the past has meant being paged along with a technical support team when one of the cabinets that stores a [product ] unit malfunctions.   Also, whenever a [product   ] is used you debrief all the rescuers, follow up on the patient’s status in the Emergency Room and document the events surrounding the incident -- the initial EKG readout, the time from collapse, to dispatch, to ambulance arrival, to first shock.  With respect to the operation of the [product    ], you said that when its EKG display shows a lethal heart rhythm, it either fires or does not, and  all of the [Alpha] [products    ] that the Department owns have always fired when they should.   Your  Proposed  Outside  Employment:    In  your  proposed  outside  employment  with  [Alpha]  you would speak at conferences in order to promote [M                           ] programs and provide consultation  to  [Alpha].    Your  employment  would  be  governed  by  a  “Profession  Services Agreement” between you and [Alpha], a copy of which you forwarded to the Board.  Although you already speak at [place    ] conferences on behalf of the City and also occasionally speak at other conferences  on  behalf  of  groups  such  as  the  American  Heart  Association,  you  said  that  the opportunity to work with [Alpha] would allow you to reach a much wider audience.  You said that you would be speaking at conferences such as the European Resucitation Committee’s conference. Although [Alpha] would purchase the speaking time for you to speak at these conferences, and pay you for your time, and thus you would be acting as a paid employee of [Alpha], you said that you would  not  be  accompanied  by  [Alpha]  representatives,  you  would  not  be  handing  out  [Alpha] literature,  and  you  would  not  have  a  business  card  with  [Alpha]’s  name  on  it.    If  asked  about particular products, however, you said that you would provide facts about the differences between products, mention which products had passed which critical laboratory tests, and so forth.  These facts, in your opinion, would present [Alpha] in a favorable light because, in your opinion, [Alpha]’s [Saver                  ] is the best [product ] on the market.  In addition to speaking at conferences, the proposed consulting agreement between you and [Alpha] stipulates that you will provide consultation to [Alpha].  More precisely, the agreement states that you will have the duty ""to receive calls and provide consultation to potential customers interested in initiating [M                                      ] Programs within the domestic United States, keeping [Alpha]-[Saver    ] personnel advised of those discussions.""  Furthermore, the agreement contains a clause on confidential information, stating that ""Other than in the performance of this Agreement, neither  Contractor  nor  Contractor’s  agents...  shall  use  or  disclose  to  any  person  or  entity  any confidential  information of [Alpha]... which is obtained from [Alpha] or otherwise  prepared or discovered... in the performance of this Agreement.""  Case No. 00009.A May 17, 2000 Page 4  Your superiors in the [Department 1        ] have indicated that if the Board of Ethics does not object to your outside employment, it will approve your acceptance of [Alpha]’s offer. [John   ] said that the Department considers your public speaking about [M] and the Department’s program to be a valuable contribution to the reputation of the City.  He also said you have  been very careful to prevent your speaking engagements with organizations such as the American Heart Association, undertaken on your vacation time, from interfering with your City work. He said that in several past instances you had declined invitations from such organizations, when the Department said it needed you in Chicago.  LAW AND ANALYSIS:   As in all outside employment cases, several sections of the Ordinance are relevant to your situation.  Section 2-156-030, ""Improper Influence"" states:  No official or employee shall make, participate in making or in any way attempt to use his position to influence any City governmental decision or action in which he knows or has reason to know that he has any economic interest distinguishable from its effect on the public generally.  and 2-156-080(a), ""Conflicts of Interest"" states:  No official or employee shall make or participate in the making of any governmental decision  with  respect  to  any  matter  in  which  he  has  any  economic  interest distinguishable from that of the general public.  Section 2-156-010(i) defines ""economic interest"" as ""any interest valued or capable of valuation in monetary terms....""  These sections prohibit City employees from participating in or influencing governmental decisions or actions in which they have an ""economic interest"" (as defined) that is distinguishable from that of the public.  Interpreting these sections, the Board has concluded that a City employee has an economic interest by virtue of outside, paid employment.  See, e.g., Case Nos. 98062.A, 94009.A, 92053.I,  and  92044.A.    If  that  economic  interest  will  be  affected  by  the  City  employee's governmental decisions, then a conflict of interest arises and the employee is prohibited from making such decisions.    To ensure that City employees do not make decisions that relate to their outside employment, the Board has looked with great care at any situation in which a City employee’s outside employer seeks to do or does business with that employee’s Department.  In a recent case, the Board ruled that an employee possesses an economic interest in his or her outside employment.  Therefore, a conflict of interest arises when an employee, in his or her City job, participates in decisions that are  related to or may enhance his or her outside employment. Case No. 98062.A.       Case No. 00009.A May 17, 2000 Page 5  With respect to your particular situation, if you accept the consulting position with [Alpha], you will have an economic interest in that position.  You indicated that, in the past, you have engaged in activities for the City such as researching the different models of [products    ] on the market, using this research to write specifications for the Department's RFPs, and advising the [Department 2   ] on their implementation of a [M] system.  Your immediate supervisor, [Assistant                        ] [John               ], noted that your activity in the initial Department purchase of [products    ] was a one-time occurrence, since the Department did not anticipate purchasing more [products    ].  He said that it was possible that the maintenance of the City's [products    ] would require future contact with [Alpha]; however, he indicated you would not have a role in this contact.  He also stated that he believed that it would be possible for you to avoid making decisions about [Alpha] in your job.     However, the facts presented indicate that as the Project Coordinator of the Department's [Life ] Program you continue to be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the [M] program, which relies on [Alpha]'s [products    ]; your duties revolve around the [Alpha] [Name 2                        ]. You  are  required  to  stay  abreast  of  [product          ]  maintenance  and  you  are  responsible  for documenting events on each use of a [product     ].  Each report on the use of a [product    ] entails an evaluation, if implicit, of the [Alpha] [product    ] –  whether a rescuer was able to use it, whether it was effective, and if not, what went wrong.  Furthermore, although you have stated that none of the Department’s [products    ] have ever malfunctioned, the possibility that some kind of difficulty surrounding the use of a [product    ] could arise does not seem implausible.  If, for example, there were litigation relating to the use of a [product    ] at a City [place], it is likely that you would be a key witness for the City.  Your effectiveness as a witness for the City would be compromised by your outside  employment  with  [Alpha].    Finally,    in  the  course  of  your  City  employment,  you  have accumulated a significant amount of experience and expertise that has been and may continue to be valuable to other departments or other agencies that the [Department 1        ] would like to assist.   In  sum,  your  City  position  obliges  you  to  assess  the  [Alpha]  [product        ]  --  in  the  context  of continuing maintenance, in reports on incidents in which a [product    ] was used,  in advising your superiors or other departments.  In carrying out your duties for the City you engage in actions and make or participate in the making of decisions that affect the reputation of [Alpha] and the [Saver                                      ]. Therefore the Board concludes that your City responsibilities, which include evaluating [Alpha] [products    ], relate to your proposed employment with [Alpha].  Your City assessments of the [Alpha] [product    ] could be affected by your paid position with [Alpha], and your impartiality (or certainly the appearance of your impartiality) could  be impaired.  Although it may be possible to exclude you from some of these activities, such as advising other departments, it seems disadvantageous to the interests of the City that someone with your expertise and experience be excluded from sharing it on behalf of the City.  Furthermore, your duties for the City and [Alpha] overlap; for the City, you consult with parties interested in establishing a [M] program, and [Alpha] is asking you to do the same for it; the parties with whom you consult for each employer could even, on  occasion,  be  the  same.    Thus  your  City  duties  are  clearly  related  to  your  proposed  outside employment.  Case No. 00009.A May 17, 2000 Page 6  Conclusion on Sections 2-156-030 and 2-156-080: From the facts presented, the Board concludes that if you accept this offer of employment with [Alpha] and continue in your duties discussed here as the Project Coordinator of the Department’s [Saver  ] Program, you will be in violation of  Sections 2-156-030 and 2-156-080 of the Ordinance. If you accept the [Alpha] position, these sections will prohibit you from making, participating in, or using your City position to influence any City decisions or actions that entail evaluating [Alpha] [products    ] -- therefore you will be prohibited from such activities as preparing reports on each use of a [product    ], participating in or advising on maintenance, and consulting with other departments or any other person or agency on behalf of the City about [M] programs, when the consultation involves any consideration of the qualities and merits of [products    ].    The other  provisions of the Ethics Ordinance that most directly apply to your situation concern fiduciary duty and the use of confidential information.  Section 2-156-020 states:  Officials and employees shall at all times in the performance of their public duties owe a fiduciary duty to the City.  Section 2-156-070 states:  No  current  or  former  official  or  employee  shall  use  or  disclose,  other  than  in  the performance of his official duties and responsibilities, or as may be required by law, confidential  information  gained  in  the  course  of  or  by  reason  of  his  position  or employment.  Confidential information means information that cannot be obtained through the state’s Freedom of Information Act.  Section 2-156-070.  The  fiduciary  duty  provision  obliges  you  to  use  your  City  position  responsibly  and  in  the  best interests of the public, and to exercise your professional judgment and City responsibilities free from conflicting  duties  to  outside  entities.      If  you  were  to  perform  your  responsibilities  under  the proposed consulting agreement, you could find yourself in situations in which your ability to adhere to your fiduciary duty to the City could be compromised.    Under the proposed agreement, your responsibilities for [Alpha] would include receiving calls and providing  consultation  to  potential  customers  interested  in  [M]  Programs,  and  keeping  [Alpha] personnel  advised  of  your  discussions.    Furthermore,  the  agreement  includes  a  confidential information clause, which would prohibit you from using or disclosing any confidential information of [Alpha] obtained from [Alpha] or discovered in the performance of your agreement with [Alpha]. By your own account, you receive calls and provide consultation to parties interested in [M] as part of your City employment.     Case No. 00009.A May 17, 2000 Page 7  Accepting a consulting position with [Alpha], therefore, creates a situation where you could have information about potential clients by virtue of your City job that would be economically useful to [Alpha].  However, the fiduciary duty provision of the Ordinance prohibits use of one’s City position for  a  private  benefit.    Case  No.  92014.A    (A  City  employee  was  prohibited  from  using,  to  sell insurance, City traffic citation records to which he had special access because of his City position, even  though  the  information  on  the  records  was  available  to  the  public,  but  through  the  more cumbersome procedure of the Freedom of Information Act).  This provision would prohibit you from communicating to [Alpha] the identity of any party who informed you, in your capacity as a City employee,  that  it  was  interested  in  setting  up  a  [M]  program,  or  from  relaying  to  [Alpha]  any information  that may be of economic use to [Alpha], if you received that information as a result of your City position. It would also prohibit you from using that information while acting as an [Alpha] employee.    Accepting a consulting position with [Alpha] also creates a situation in which you could be contacted by the same interested party in your capacity as a City employee and in your capacity as an employee of [Alpha].  This is problematic on several counts.  First, if you had spoken with a potential client and  informed  [Alpha]  about  this  discussion,  on  your  own  time  and  as  part  of  your  outside employment with [Alpha], this would prevent you from providing impartial consultation to that client on behalf of the City, as part of your City job.  Second, you might have information derived from your City position that you could not relay to [Alpha], and at the same time possess information derived from your [Alpha] position that, under your agreement, could not be relayed to the City. This would place you in the untenable position of trying to maintain two separate roles in your interactions with the same party.  The exercise of your City responsibilities would not be free from conflicting duties to an outside entity, as your fiduciary duty to the City mandates.  Further, City information  you  have  might  well  be  confidential  as  defined  in  Section  2-156-070,  and  the circumstances, by their nature, create a danger that you could inadvertently reveal that information, in violation of the confidentiality provision of the Ordinance.   Conclusion on Sections 2-156-020 and 2-156-070:  Accordingly, the Board concludes that if you accept  the  consulting  position  with  [Alpha]  and  perform  your  responsibilities  stipulated  by  the proposed consulting agreement, you will  be placed in continual jeopardy of violating your fiduciary duty to the City, as well as the confidentiality provision of the Ordinance.    DETERMINATION:  From the facts presented, the Board concludes that if you accept this offer of employment with [Alpha] and continue in your duties discussed here as the Project Coordinator of the Department’s [Life    ] Program, you will be in violation of  Sections 2-156-030 and 2-156-080 of the Ordinance.  If you accept the [Alpha] position, these sections will prohibit you from making, participating in, or using your City position to influence any City decisions or actions that entail evaluating [Alpha] [products    ] -- therefore you will be prohibited from such activities as preparing reports on each use of a [product ], participating in or advising on maintenance, and consulting with other departments or any other person or agency on behalf of the City about [M] programs, when the  Case No. 00009.A May 17, 2000 Page 8  consultation involves any consideration of the qualities and merits of [products    ]. From the facts stated,  the  Board  further  concludes  that  if  you  carry  out  your  responsibilities  stipulated  by  the proposed consulting agreement, you will be placed in jeopardy of violating your fiduciary duty to the City, as well as the confidentiality provision of the Ordinance.   Our determination does not necessarily dispose of all issues relevant to this situation, but is based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify the Board immediately, as any change may alter our opinion.  Other laws or rules also may apply to this situation.  For example, Personnel Rule XVIII requires that employees perform their duties in a manner that furthers the efficiency and best interest of the City, and which results in the highest level of public trust and confidence in municipal government.  Be advised that City departments have the authority to adopt and enforce rules of conduct that may be more restrictive than the limitations imposed by the Ethics Ordinance.  RELIANCE:    This  opinion  may  be  relied  upon  by  (1)  any  person  involved  in  the  specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered and (2) any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.  RECONSIDERATION: This advisory opinion is based on the facts outlined in this opinion.  If there are additional material facts or circumstances that were not available to the Board when it considered this case, you may request reconsideration of the opinion.  A request for reconsideration must (1) be submitted in writing, (2) explain the material facts and circumstances that are the basis of the request, and (3) be received by the Board within fifteen days of the date of this opinion.

This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,732 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Deming Place, from N.  Kenton Avenue to N. Kostner Avenue, W. Montana Street, from N. Kenton Avenue to N.  Kostner Avene, and N. Kilbourn Avenue, from W. Deming Place to W. Fullerton Avenue. The  old pipe dates back to 1907 and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Suarez’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                  For the first time, a ball dropped in Times Square in New York to signal the new year.    President Theodore Roosevelt shook a record 8,513 hands in one day.    The first cabs with taxi meters began operating in London.    Finland became the first European country to give women the right to vote.    The automatic washer and dryer were introduced.    Oklahoma became the 46th State.    Actor John Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa.                                                      DEMING PL., MONTANA ST., AND KILBOURN AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,732 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Deming Place, from N. Kenton Avenue to N. Kostner Avenue, W. Montana  Street, from N. Kenton Avenue to N. Kostner Avene, and N. Kilbourn Avenue, from W. Deming  Place to W. Fullerton Avenue    Reason:  The old main pipe dates back to 1907 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late September 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Deming Place, W. Montana Street, and N. Kilbourn  Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to  traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it  means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local  traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      ALDERMAN REGNER RAY SUAREZ    ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   3-1-1   773- 486-6488   312-742-1021                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late September  2013. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.   Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  These  screens should be removed prior to flushing.  This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement.  If you have any  questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.         DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

The Commission is re- sponsible for recommending to the City Council which individual buildings, sites, objects, or  districts should be designated as Chicago Landmarks, which protects them by law.   The landmark designation process begins with a staff study and a preliminary summary  of information related to the potential designation criteria. The next step is a preliminary vote  by the landmarks commission as to whether the proposed landmark is worthy of consideration.  This vote not only initiates the formal designation process, but it places the review of city per- mits for the property under the jurisdiction of the Commission until a final landmark recom- mendation is acted on by the City Council.   This Landmark Designation Report is subject to possible revision and amendment dur- ing the designation process. Only language contained within a designation ordinance adopted  by the City Council should be regarded as final.   2                   1956  Harry Weese    227 EAST WALTON PLACE APARTMENT  BUILDING  227 E. Walton Place    Date of Construction:  Architect:       The 227 East Walton Place Apartment Building is a significant post-World War II structure by a  noteworthy Chicago architect.  It is a thirteen-story, 24-unit apartment building designed by  Harry Weese, one of Chicago’s most eclectic and innovative architects of the modern American  architectural movement.  Through its incorporation of features inspired by historic Chicago  School buildings, including, most distinctively, projecting three-sided bay windows, 227 East  Walton Place combines modernist design with references to past architecture, highly unusual  and inventive in the context of 1950s-era Chicago high-rise architecture.      Harry Weese, the designer of the 227 East Walton Place Apartment Building, was one of the  most significant architects working in Chicago from the early 1950s through at least the 1990s,  during which time he demonstrated his accomplishments as a modern architect, urban planner,  and preservation architect through commissions in Chicago, nationally, and internationally. He  questioned the primacy of the International Style modernism being championed in Chicago in  the 1950s and 1960s by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and his followers.  Weese fought for mod- ern architecture that would be more humane and responsive to historic architectural traditions  and to urban context.  227 East Walton Place exemplifies Weese’s interest as a modern architect  in the primacy of human scale and texture over the machine-made, in contextual design over a  ""one-size-fits all"" approach, and in the importance of the continuity of architectural history  rather than a clean break from the past, all of which set him apart from the American architec- tural mainstream of the 1950s.  A comprehensive study of Weese’s life, work and influence was  published by Robert Bruegmann and Kathleen Murphy Skolnik in their 2010 The Architecture  of Harry Weese, a monograph to which this report owes much.     Built in 1956, a time when suburbs were draining Chicago’s population, 227 East Walton Place  reflects Harry Weese’s vision that downtown Chicago could foster a range of uses beyond work,  including residential and recreation.   The building is an early, excellently-designed apartment  tower, a building type that exemplifies the rapid development of lakefront neighborhoods such  as Streeterville, where the building is located, during the 1950s and 1960s.   3   Located midway between North Michigan Avenue and the lake, the 227 East Walton Place Apartment Build- ing is a thirteen-story, 24-unit apartment building designed by Harry Weese, one of Chicago’s most prolific  and singular architects of the modern era.  Rather than breaking from the past, Weese referenced visual ele- ments from Chicago’s architectural history in the stacked projecting window bays, a design element derived  from the late-nineteenth century Chicago School buildings.  The brick cladding suggests warmth and unpre- tentiousness and reflects the architect’s interest in Scandinavian modernism.   4   BUILDING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION    The 227 East Walton Place Apartment Building is located two blocks east of Chicago’s fash- ionable North Michigan Avenue and one block west of North Lake Shore Drive in the Streeter- ville neighborhood.  As they are today, the surrounding blocks in 1956 were distinguished by  luxury apartments, shopping and dining.  Chicago architect Harry Weese acted as both designer  and speculative developer of the building, a combination that was generally discouraged by the  architectural profession at the time.  John Baird, then a vice president at the real estate broker- age firm of Baird & Warner, partnered with Weese on the development.  The partners pur- chased the 50-foot-wide lot on which the building is located for $40,000, and its construction  was announced in the Chicago Tribune on July 2, 1955, in a short article that touted the innova- tive radiant heating and cooling systems planned for the building.      Roughly square in plan, the compact building measures 50’ across its front elevation facing E.  Walton Place block raised above a recessed first floor. The exterior wall plane is only carried  down to the first floor in limited areas such as the central stairwell enclosure on the north eleva- tion and the rectangular piers on the east and west elevations.  The east side of the first floor  contains a small lobby with floor-to-ceiling windows and visually-distinctive, modernist exte- rior door hardware which appears to be original.  A driveway next to the lobby leads to rear  ground-level parking.  The west side of the first floor contains a service entrance and a ramp  down to basement parking.  The cast-in-place reinforced concrete structure of the building is  painted white but otherwise left exposed at the first floor.      Above the first floor, the walls are clad in vertical bands of visually-warm red brick alternating  with vertical bands of stacked window openings giving the building a striped appearance.  The  unornamented flat planes of brick are relieved by the window stacks which either project or re- cede from the brick wall plane.  Windows are steel-sash with operable casements.  To balance  the verticality of the window stacks, the concrete floor plates between each story are left ex- posed lending the design a human scale and visually expressing the structure of the building.   Unlike the steel-and-glass curtain-walled residential towers being perfected at the time by fel- low Chicago architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Weese limited the building’s window area to  50 percent of the exterior envelope to create a more private interior and to allow more flexibil- ity in interior furnishing.  The building is topped with a flat roof with mechanical equipment.    At the front elevation of 227 E. Walton Place, Weese used three-sided, projecting bay windows  arranged in two vertical stacks.  Such projecting bay windows were a defining feature of Chi- cago’s early Chicago School skyscrapers, such as the Reliance and Monadnock buildings, as  well as hotels such as the Metropole and Plaza, that preceded Walton by half a century.  Just as  they had been used in the past, projecting bay windows enhanced views up and down the street  and improved lighting and ventilation.  They also give the front façade an undulating quality.   Weese would use projecting bays again in his designs for the Pierce Dormitory at the University  of Chicago (1959) and the John Fewkes Tower apartments at 55 W. Chestnut Street (1967), and  it was a motif adopted by other architects in Chicago well into the 1970s.         5   The base of the building with recessed lobby and ex- posed concrete structure.    227 E. Walton is an early and significant tall  apartment building from the post-World War II  era.  Its combination of modern architecture  with cues relating it to historic Chicago archi- tecture is exceptional for the 1950s.    Vertical bands of brick alternating with projecting bays  gives the building a striped appearance   The original  entrance door  with custom  hardware  (bottom left)  and a detail of a  window bay  revealing the  concrete struc- ture of the  building  (bottom right).   6   Images of the building from a 1956 marketing bro- chure which promoted the building as “contemporary  in the better sense, 227 brings back the pleasant fea- tures so often neglected in ‘modern’ apartments”.

Cranbrook deepened Weese’s appreciation of Aalto and Eliel  Saarinen, and it was at Cranbrook where Eero Saarinen and Weese established a lifelong friend- ship.        Cranbrook was followed by another fellowship with the Bemis Foundation in Cambridge, Mas- sachusetts, with John Ely Burchard who was researching low-cost housing.  In 1940, Weese  accepted an invitation from Gordon Bunshaft to work at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) in  Chicago.  Though it would become one of America’s premier modern architectural firms,  Weese stayed at SOM for only a year before partnering in 1941 with Ben Baldwin, an architect  he had met at Cranbrook.  In the same year, Weese met his future wife Kate “Kitty” Baldwin,  the sister of Ben Baldwin.    World War II cut short the Weese-Baldwin partnership.  In the autumn of 1941, Weese ac- cepted an officer’s commission on a Navy destroyer where he served as an engineer for the du- ration.  He took away from the experience an appreciation for the compactness of naval archi- tecture and it provided valuable experience with mechanical systems which complimented his  architectural training.  At the end of the war, Harry returned to Chicago, and he and Kitty were  wed.      Like many observers of American cities after in the early post-war years, Weese felt that Chi- cago was deteriorating after a decade of disinvestment during the Depression and another five  years of inattention during the war.  As an architect and urban planner, Weese felt he had much  to offer Chicago.    During the war, Weese had hatched a plan to start a retail store in Chicago that would showcase  reasonably-priced modern furniture and housewares.  In 1947 Weese, his wife Kitty, and Jody  Kingrey, a young woman working at another design store in Chicago, established the “Baldwin/ Kingrey” store in the Diana Court Building at N. Michigan Ave. and E. Ohio St.  The store car- ried Alvar Aalto’s Artek line of modern home furnishings as well as the “Baldry” line which  Weese designed.      Once the store was up and running, Weese established in 1947 his own architectural practice,  Harry Weese & Associates, in a small back office of the Baldwin/Kingrey shop.  Throughout  the late 1940s Weese was sustained by commissions for houses for his family and began to be- come active in urban planning efforts in Chicago as a consultant for the Chicago Plan Commis- sion and as a member of the Urban Renewal Committee of the Metropolitan Housing and Plan- ning Council.     In 1950 Weese met industrialist J. Irwin Miller, a very important client who put the practice on  stable footing.  Miller owned the Cummins Engine Company in Columbus, Indiana, and he  worked to transform the small city into a showcase for modern architecture by paying the archi- tectural fees for a chosen list of modernist architects if they were hired for jobs in Columbus.   Miller’s interest in architecture was sparked in 1939 when his mother convinced Eliel Saarinen  to design the First Christian Church in Columbus.  During the construction J. Irwin Miller en- tertained the architect’s son Eero, and the two became lifelong friends.  Eero went on to design  several buildings in Columbus.  As Eero’s practice became busier, he referred Miller to Harry   14   "

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,261 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Desplaines Street, from  W. 16th Street to S. Canalport Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1907, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Solis’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Daniel Solis                   25th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             Do you wonder what was happening in 1907? That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                           •  For the first time, a ball dropped in Times Square in New York to signal the new year.  •  President Theodore Roosevelt shook a record 8,513 hands in one day.  •  The first cabs with taxi meters began operating in London.  •  Finland became the first European country to give women the right to vote.  •  The automatic washer and dryer were introduced.  •  Oklahoma became the 46th State.  •  Actor John Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa.                                    DESPLAINES ST. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,261 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Desplaines Street, from W. 16th Street to S. Canalport Avenue.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1907 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in mid October 2014. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Desplaines Street outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                    ALDERMAN DANIEL SOLIS   773-523-4100                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in mid  October 2014. Restoration will follow in April 2015. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
