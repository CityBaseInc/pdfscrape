This is part of our approach  to renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with  you our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed  about the project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 918 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Wells Street, from  W. Root Street to W. 43rd Street. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Dowell’s office, and she has made clear we are to  put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood  through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the  project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct  ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program  and our Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Pat Dowell             3rd Ward    1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1   Do you wonder what was happening in 1890?  That’s the year the old water main was  installed beneath your street.  Among other things:       CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were   born.                     SOUTH WELLS STREET WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 918 feet of 8- inch water main in S. Wells Street, from W. Root Street to W. 43rd Street.      Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further,  the old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late August 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Wells Street outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety.  You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours.  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we  can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                              ALDERMAN PAT DOWELL   773-373-9273   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021            FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS           What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If  you have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also  call Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the  voicemail message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside  of our working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the  workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late August  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the  services from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour  notice when this is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old  pipe will break.  They can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If  we do this, we will let you know what is happening, even though we may be unable to  give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be  good neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By  working together, we can complete this important project as friends working for the  improvement of our community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your  neighbors to reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective  response as the only strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood  basis to work with us on practical steps (public and private) to protect your  property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters  to monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for  only the water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while  protecting one of our most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This  means that with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their  water bills.      Homeowner Incentives         Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:   A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the   meter had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit  www.metersave.org, call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account  number ready.  Space is limited based on funding availability and the number of  volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter  complete with the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of  charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to  Water Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1   place inside the home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount  of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this  limited time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise,  Water Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the  sustainability of our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500  gallons per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household  water consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water  consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This  saves 25 gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers  typically use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in  the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use  by 20-50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use  thousands of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save  money and water by preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45  million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could  face severe water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the  Chicago Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water  from Lake Michigan.               Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!

Wilhelm to act as Chair Pro Tem for the October 19, 2011 meeting of the Board of Ethics.  I.  Approval of Minutes  The Board VOTED 4-0 (Miguel A. Ruiz and Tiffany Chappell Ingram absent) to approve the Open Session Minutes of the August 24, 2011 meeting.  Due to lack of a quorum, there was no September 14, 2011 Board Meeting.  II.  Chair’s Report  Executive Director’s Report  III.    A.  Education–Classes  Since the last meeting, staff has conducted 5 classes for those required to attend, on August 25 and 26 and September 8 and 22, and October 6.  A total of 57 employees and 2 elected officials attended. There are currently 17 persons scheduled for class on October 20, and 23 on November 4.  At  the  request  of  the  Mayor’s  Office,  staff:  i)  on  September  14,  made  a  60  minute presentations to a delegation of 30 officials from Shenyang, Peoples’ Republic of China; ii) on August 29, made a 60 minute presentation to a visiting delegation of 8 officials from Thailand;  and  iii)  on  September  23,  made  a  presentation  to  a  visiting  delegation  of  14 officials from Ukraine.  On  August  30,  staff  conducted  a  90  minute  training  class  for  the  staff  and  directors  of HACIA,  the  Hispanic  American  Construction  Industry  Association,  at  the  request  of  its Executive Director and General Counsel; on September 28 and October 4, staff conducted  Open Session Minutes October 19, 2011 Page 2  two 90 minute classes for a total of 31 employees of City vendors, at the request of the Chief Procurement  Officer,  pursuant  to  directives  she  made  to  these  vendors  resulting  from investigations conducted by the Inspector General’s Office.  A third class, scheduled for November 30, will be conducted for approximately 60 employees of a City contractor, for the same reason.  B.  Education–Mandatory Annual Ethics Education  To date, approximately 19,975 employees and 3 aldermen have completed the program, and another 1,201 are in process.  This is about 60% compliance.  To date, all but 1 lobbyist completed the program (a 99.98% completion rate), and he will be discussed in closed session.  The 2011-2012 lobbyist program has been completed, and we intend to have it posted and ready by November 4.  C.  Statements of Financial Interests  To date, 14,767 employees and officials have filed 2011 Statements of Financial Interests. There remain just 4 employees and appointed officials who were required to file by May 31 but have yet to do so.    We met with DOIT and our programmers from Crowe Horwath to begin implementing a series of enhancements to our on-line filing system for Statements of Financial Interests, based on the first year's experience in administering the system. These enhancements will be ready for the 2012 filing year.  D.  Lobbyist Registration  There are currently 625 lobbyists that have registered with the City for this year.  To date, $307,675 in lobbyist registration fees have been deposited with the Department of Revenue. To date, there remain 2 non-filers and 6 whose filings remain incomplete.    E.  Ethics Pledges  On September 23, the City went live with the website that posts a searchable list of all filers on the internet; and the Board has a protocol for adding new filers that has been developed by the Board. There are currently 610 posted.  Open Session Minutes October 19, 2011 Page 3  F.  Illinois Freedom of Information Act  Since the last regularly scheduled Board meeting, the office has received 11 new requests under the Freedom of Information Act.  They included requests for 43 lobbyists’ records between the years 2007-2011, one request for aldermanic disclosures, 2 requests for lobbyists representing 6 discrete clients 2004-2011, and one request for records for advisory opinions with respect to an alderman for the period August 1, 2011-September 7, 2011, and 1 request for Statements of Financial Interests. The staff sent a denial letter with respect to the request for advisory opinions, produced the aldermanic disclosures and all available statements of financial  interests,  all  records  were  located  for  the  lobbyist  records,  and  some  of  the lobbyists’ records for those representing the clients about which requestor had inquired were located. These requests resulted in production of 74 records and copying of 304 pages from 12 of those records.  G.  Legislative Fellow  Beginning September 23, and through October 17, we hosted Giorgi Bolkvadze, an employee of the Deputy Mayor of Tbilisi, Georgia, who is visiting the United States on a month-long fellowship through the U.S. State Department. Together, we worked on a project for him to set up ethics and campaign commissions and draft laws in the cities of Tbilisi and Kutaisi.  H.  Ethics Consortium  We have been coordinating with our cohort, the Chief Ethics Officer at the Chicago Public Schools, to set up a regular, monthly meeting with our counterparts at the Cook County Board  of  Ethics,  City  Colleges,  Chicago  Park  District,  CTA,  the  MWRGC,  PBS,  and, possibly, the Illinois Executive Ethics Commission in Springfield. Our goal would be to discuss ongoing legal issues, managerial and technology strategies, and common challenges.  I.  Budget  Last week, the Mayor submitted his budget for 2012.  For our agency, it includes a 32% overall increase.  We await approval from the Budget Office to fill our first vacancy in 4 years, for Attorney/Investigator (to replace Courtney Kimble, who resigned on September 9), and have revised the criteria for the position.  We also look forward to hiring our Deputy Director. We expect to post for the Attorney position in the next few weeks, and for the Deputy to start on January 3, 2012. We are scheduled for our budget hearing with the City Council’s budget committee one week from today, October 27.  IV. Old Business  None.  Open Session Minutes October 19, 2011 Page 4  V.

While the values in the draft inventory were similar to the values in the final  2015  community  inventory  contained  in  this  report,  there  are  a  few  differences.  The  draft  inventory  had  a  total  of  30,955,862  metric  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  per  year  (MT CO2e/year) emitted whereas the final inventory has a total of 32,651,379 MT CO2e/year.  The notable differences included increased electricity-related emissions and decreased on-road  vehicle emissions. The reasons for these changes are as follows:     Electric Grid Emission Factor – The draft 2015 inventory used a utility-specific emission  factor for grid electricity. In the spring of 2017, the City completed an update of the 2005  and  2010  inventories.  To  make  the  2005,  2010,  and  2015  inventories  directly  comparable  with  each  other,  the  City  needed  an  emission  factor  from  a  consistent  source  that  could  be  used  for  each  reporting  year.  Due  to  changes  in  utility  structure  between 2005 and 2010, the City needed to switch the draft 2015 inventory electricity  emission factor to the default U.S. EPA regional grid emission factor. This resulted in an  increase in the reported level of scope 2 grid electricity emissions.     On-Road  Vehicle  Emissions  –  In  the  interim  between  the  development  of  the  draft  inventory and the final inventory, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning was able  to provide the City with updated activity and emission factors to use to calculate on-road  vehicle  emissions  in  the  community.  These  updated  data  resulted  in  a  lower  level  of  emissions compared to the value contained in the draft report.

Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report – Calendar Year 2015   Page iii      1.4.2  Purpose of Emissions Inventories  A  GHG  emissions  inventory  is  an  estimate  of  GHGs  emitted  to,  or  removed  from,  the  atmosphere  over  a  specific  period  (usually  one  year).  Preparation  of  an  emissions  inventory  provides the City with an understanding of where Chicago’s GHG emissions are coming from  and  serves  as  a  starting  point  for  developing  and  monitoring  results  of  strategies  that  can  effectively reduce GHG emissions. The City has previously developed community-scale GHG  emissions  inventories  for  the  calendar  years  1990,  2000,  2005,  and  2010.  The  inventory  presented within this report updates the community inventory for the 2015 calendar year and  discusses trends between the inventory years to show progress over time.   An emissions inventory can help with any or all of the following tasks:    Identifying the greatest sources of GHG emissions within a particular geographic region,   department, or activity;    Understanding emission trends over time;   Quantifying the benefits of activities that reduce emissions;   Establishing a basis for developing or updating an action plan;   Tracking progress in reducing emissions; and   Setting and/or revisiting and revising goals and targets for future reductions.   Emissions  inventories  provide  a  snapshot  of  the  amount  and  source  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions in a given year. The base year inventory serves as a reference point against which  future performance and progress can be monitored and can help to assess the effectiveness of  City strategies and actions.   1.4.3  Overview of the GHG Inventory Methodology  The  2015  Community  Inventory  adheres  to  guidance  provided  in  the  Global  Protocol  for  Community-Scale  Greenhouse  Gas  Emission  Inventories  (GPC).14  The  GPC  is  a  highly  respected  protocol  with  established  and  well-vetted  methodological  guidelines.  Prior  to  publication of the GPC in 2014, cities developed GHG emission inventories using a variety of  protocols, making comparison of inventory results both year-over-year within the same city, as  well as between cities, difficult. The GPC, first published in 2014, is the first protocol to provide  “a  consistent,  transparent  and  internationally  recognized  approach  for  cities  to  measure  and  report  emissions,  allowing  for  credible  comparison  and  aggregation  across  timescales  and  geographies.”15 The Compact of Mayors requires signatories such a Chicago to complete GHG  emission inventories using the GPC.  The City of Chicago’s previous GHG emission inventories were conducted prior to publication of  the  GPC,  and  therefore  used  a  variety  of  protocols  according  to  best  practice  at  the  time  of  completion. For this 2015 GHG inventory and future inventories, the City of Chicago will use the  GPC  to  enable  consistent,  transparent  and  comparable  GHG  inventories  over  time  to  track  effectiveness  of  GHG  reduction  strategies  implemented  in  Chicago.  To  ensure  comparability  between past inventory years and the 2015 inventory, the City also updated the 2005 and 2010                                                    14  For more information about the GPC, visit the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities website.   15  C40 Programmes Measurement & Planning.

The Department of Water Management’s private contractor is installing 2,800 feet of 24- inch to 54-inch new sewer main in W. 100th Street (Normal-Emerald) and in W. 101st Street  (Morgan-Green). The old sewer dates back to 1893 and needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    9th Ward Office: 773-785-1100    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.

By early November 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 2,129 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Bensley  Street, from E. 107th Street to E. 109th Street and E. 109th Street, from S. Bensley Avenue to S.  Torrence Street. The old water main dates back to 1896, and needs to be replaced. We expect the  water main work to be completed by mid January 2018. Restoration will follow in mid April 2018.  Dates may change depending on weather and other factors.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  10th Ward Office: 773-768-8138  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.

In the last century, air  temperatures have increased between one-half and one  degree (F). Warming in the oceans around Hawaii has  damaged coral reefs, and, in recent decades, increased  ocean acidity has threatened reefs and other marine  ecosystems. Average precipitation decreased in the last  century, reducing freshwater availability on some islands and  affecting delicate land-based ecosystems, often harming  native species. In the last 50 years, sea level has risen along  Hawaii’s shores, increasing erosion and threatening coastal  communities and infrastructure.  Climate is changing because the earth is warming. People  have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the air by   40 percent since the late 1700s. Other heat-trapping green- house gases are also increasing. These gases have warmed  the surface and lower atmosphere of our planet about one  degree during the last 50 years. Evaporation increases as  the atmosphere warms, which increases humidity, average  rainfall, and the frequency of heavy rainstorms in many  places—but contributes to drought in others. Greenhouse gases are also changing the world’s oceans and  ice cover. Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic  acid, so the oceans are becoming more acidic. The surface  of the ocean has warmed about one degree during the last  80 years. Warming is causing snow to melt earlier in spring,  and mountain glaciers are retreating. Even the great ice  sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are shrinking. Thus the  sea is rising at an increasing rate.  80 79 78 77 76 75 74 73 72 71 70 1950  ) F ° (   e r u t a r e p m e T e g a r e v A     Honululu  Kahului  Lihue  Hilo  1960  1970  1980  1990  2000  2010  2020  Year  Average annual temperatures have increased across Hawaii since  1950. Source: NOAA   August 2016  EPA 430-F-16-013   Ocean Warming and Acidif ication  The waters around Hawaii are warming, which is harming  Hawaii’s coral reefs and marine ecosystems. The El Niño- Southern Oscillation (“El Niño”) and other natural cycles cause  ocean temperatures in the Pacific to fluctuate from year to year  and from decade to decade. Even after accounting for these  natural patterns, the waters around Hawaii have been warming  since the 1950s, with temperatures rising by several degrees  from the ocean surface down to at least 600 feet. Rising water  temperatures can harm the algae that live inside corals. Because  algae provide food for the coral, a loss of algae weakens corals  and can eventually kill them. This process is commonly known as  ""coral bleaching,"" because the loss of the algae also causes the  corals to turn white. Mass bleaching events are becoming more  common, with documented cases in the north-western Hawaiian  Islands in 1996 and 2002. Water temperature spikes in Hawaii  have also been linked to coral disease outbreaks.  Bleached corals in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, in the fall of 2014. Credit: XL  Catlin Seaview Survey   Increasing ocean acidity can also damage corals, as well as  shellfish and other organisms that depend on minerals in the  water to build their skeletons and shells. The acidity of the  Pacific Ocean has increased by about 25 percent in the past  three centuries, and it is likely to increase another 40 to 50  percent by 2100.   Warming and acidification could result in widespread damage to  the entire marine ecosystem in the waters off Hawaii. Hawaii’s  isolation in the Central Pacific makes it home to a wide range of  fish species not found anywhere else in the world. Many of these  fish rely on healthy coral reefs for habitat, and even with substan- tial cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, up to 40 percent of coral   to expand their ranges into higher elevations, infecting native  birds with diseases like avian malaria.  Shoreline Loss Since 1960, sea level has risen between two and eight inches  relative to Hawaii’s shoreline. Sea level rise can make Hawaii’s  existing coastal hazards—such as waves, hurricanes, tsunamis,  and extreme tides—even worse. Additionally, rising sea level has  accelerated coastal erosion, which has resulted in wetland mi- gration and cliff collapse. Chronic erosion has affected more than  70 percent of Kauai and Maui’s beaches over the last century. Sea level rise and the associated coastal impacts due to in- creased flooding, elevated ground water tables, storm surge,  and erosion have the potential to harm an array of natural  and built environments in Hawaii. Dying coral reefs add to this  problem, as they leave the shoreline more vulnerable to erosion  and damage from waves. In the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands  Marine National Monument, sea level rise threatens native  species, especially those that nest on beaches, such as green  sea turtles, Hawaiian monk seals, and the endangered Laysan  finch. Damage to coastal infrastructure may also hurt Hawaii’s  economy, more than a quarter of which stems from tourism.  Waikīkī Beach alone brings in $2 billion per year in visitor spend- ing. Furthermore, many of Hawaii’s native communities are in  vulnerable coastal areas. Sea level rise and associated flooding  are expected to destroy land, coastal artifacts, and structures of  significant cultural value, and may force these communities to  relocate.

Health and Vulnerable People  Climate change is likely to amplify some threats to health in Ha- waii. Certain people are especially vulnerable, including children,  the elderly, the sick, and the poor.  Tourism infrastructure and nearshore coral reefs, both threatened by  climate change, in Maui.

Damage to coral  and reduced fish populations could negatively impact the   state’s economy, as these natural resources bring an estimated  $385 million to Hawaii each year through tourism, direct  consumption, and commercial fisheries.  Water Availability Rainfall in Hawaii has been decreasing, but scientists do not  know whether that trend will continue.  El Niño will probably  continue to dominate precipitation patterns from year to year in  the tropical Pacific. Climate change-related increases in air  temperatures will lead to more evaporation and more moisture  in the air. As a result, the variability in El Niño-related  precipitation is likely to increase, making rainfall predictions  difficult.  Although projections of future rainfall are uncertain, streams and  rivers on the Hawaiian Islands have experienced a reduction in  flow over the last century, resulting in less fresh water available  for people and ecosystems. Additionally, increased drought may  threaten taro and breadfruit, which are important traditional food  sources for Hawaii’s native peoples.  Land Ecosystem Changes Ecosystems on land are also experiencing impacts from a  warming climate. Many native plant species could lose ground  to invasive species better adapted to the changing climate,  or simply fail to thrive in altered habitats. For example, higher  temperatures and increased drought have caused dramatic  declines among native plant species such as Haleakalā silver- sword. Some native species display the ability to adapt to climate  change, such as a few types of fire-adapted grasses that have  shifted to higher altitudes in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.  However, some insects such as mosquitoes have also been able   The sources of information about climate and the impacts of climate change in this publication are: the national climate assessments by the U.S. Global Change  Research Program, synthesis and assessment products by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, assessment reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change, and EPA’s Climate Change Indicators in the United States.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 5,291 feet of 8-inch, 2,024 feet of 12-inch, and 171 feet of 24- inch water main in N. Western Avenue (Belmont-Jones), in W. Nelson Street (Western-Oakley),  and in W. Diversey Avenue (Western-Logan). The old pipe dates back to 1891, and needs to be  replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Moreno’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Joe Moreno III              1st Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                     Do you wonder what was happening in 1891?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:              Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap   and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.                                           WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 5,291 feet of 8-inch,  2,024 feet of 12-inch, and 171 feet of 24-inch water main in N. Western Avenue (Belmont- Jones), in W. Nelson Street (Western-Oakley), and in W. Diversey Avenue (Western-Logan).    Reason:  The old main consists entirely of 8-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further,  the old pipe dates back to 1891 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in December. Final restoration will follow in the spring of 2015. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN JOE MORENO III   773-278-0101                        FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in December. Final  restoration will be completed in the spring of 2015. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
