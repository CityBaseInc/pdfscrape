JoFmston, Commissioner, Department of Environment, City of Chicago, issue the following rules and regulations pursuant to the authority granted to me by Sections 2- 30-030, 11-4-2720, and 11-4-2810 of the Municipal Code of Chicago.  1.0 Scope and Purpose. The purpose of these rules and regulations is to provide  explanatory details and procedural guidelines with regard to the enforcement of Article XXI, Environmental Noise and Vibration Control, Section 11-4-2700 et seq. of the Municipal Code of Chicago (the “Environmental Noise Ordinance”).  2.0 Sound Level Investigations. Any person investigating an alleged violation of the Environmental Noise Ordinance shall be guided by the procedures set forth below. Any deviation from these procedures shall affect the weight but not the admissibility of the sound level determination.  2.0.1 Audibility Determinations.  In order to establish compliance or noncompliance  with any section of the Environmental Noise Ordinance imposing a standard based on “average conversational level” or audibility at a specified distance, the following guidelines shall apply.  A. Without a sound level meter. Where a sound level meter is not used, the determination shall be made:  1) Using normal, unaided hearing;  2) Standing at a distance from the source or property line as specified in  the ordinance; and  3) For a period not less than ten minutes in order to determine the  average noise level over a ten minute period.  B. With a sound level meter.  In addition to the audibility determination  described above, a sound level meter measurement may be used as further If a proof to determine compliance or noncompliance under this section. sound level meter is used, then:  1) The measurements shall be taken following the guidelines set forth in  section 2.0.2 of these Rules and Regulations; and  2) Average conversational level shall be deemed to be 60 dB(A).  2.0.2 Decibel Level Measurements.  In order to establish compliance or noncompliance with any section of the Environmental Noise Ordinance imposing a decibel sound pressure level limit, the following guidelines shall apply.  A. Indoor Measurements. Where the ordinance specifies an indoor decibel level measurement, the measurement shall be taken:  1) With a sound level meter using the “A” weighting network in  compliance with specifications established by the “American National Standards Specification for Sound Level Meters” ANSI S 1.4-1983 or the most recent revision thereof;  2)  In an indoor room used for living space;  3) With a window open, unless the investigator determines that it is not  practical or feasible to open a window;  4) Standing in a location that is most likely to provide a representative  measure of the noise; and  5) For a period not less than ten minuts in order to determine the  average noise level over a ten minute period.  .  2  B. Outdoor Measurements. Where the ordinance specifies an outdoor decibel  level measurement, the measurement shall be taken:  1) With a sound level meter using the “A” weighting network in  compliance with specifications established by the “American National Standards Specification for Sound Level Meters” ANSi SI .4-1983 or the most recent revision thereof;  2) Standing at a distance specified in the ordinance as measured from the  property line of the property on which the source is located; and  3) For a period not less than ten minutes in order to determine the  average noise level over a ten minute period.  C. Ambient Noise Measurements. Where the ordinance, in Section I 1-4-2805(a), specifies two alternate decibel standards, one of which is dependent upon the ambient noise level, the Comi-nissioner or the Commissioner’s designee will determine whether or not ambient noise levels are sufficiently high so as to make it difficult to take an accurate measurement of the noise source in question. If ambient noise is determined to be sufficiently high, then, pursuant to Section 11- 4-2805(c) of the Code, enforcement personnel may request that the noise source be turned off in order to measure ambient noise levels without contribution from the noise source.  3.0 Air Handling and Refrigeration Units.  3.0.1  Sound Level Measurements. investigations set forth in section 2.0 of these Rules and Regulations, the following assumptions shall guide the Department in its response to complaints about noise from air handling units and refrigeration units (“unit”):  In addition to the procedures for sound level  1) Where one building supports more than one unit, each unit shall be treated as  an individual noise source, unless the units are similar in type and size and have common ownership, in which case all units of common ownership shall be deemed to be a single unit.  2) Where the Department determines that a unit conforms with the noise  mitigation procedures set forth in section 3.0.2 below, the Department shall not take sound level measurements of the unit.  3.0.2 Noise Mitigation Procedures.  In accordance with Section 11-4-28 10 of the Code,  if the owner of an air handling or refrigeration unit, other than a window air conditioning unit, has taken the following steps, the unit will be presumed to be in compliance with the Environmental Noise Ordinance:  1) The unit is placed no less than ten (10) feet from any window in the nearest  existing residential building;  3  I;  0)  2) The unit displays an official EPA Energy Star label, and the unit’s original  product manual is available upon request by the Department;  3) The owner of the unit keeps the unit in good repair and causes the unit to be inspected and maintained by a certified heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC/R) professional on a routine basis, at least annually; and  4) The unit contains a legible sticker, signed by a certified I-IVAC/R  professional, indicating the date of the most recent maintenance inspection, and/or the owner of the unit produces an invoice or receipt signed by a certified HVAC/R professional, indicating the date of the most recent maintenance inspection.  4.0  Equitable Considerations. Because of limited resources and environmental enforcement priorities, the Department may not be able to take enforcement action for every alleged violation of the Environmental Noise Ordinance. Therefore, in exercising the Department’s prosecutorial discretion and prioritizing use of available resources, the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee may consider and weigh the following equitable factors:  1)  2)  3)  the relative length of time the source of the alleged violation has existed in its current location as compared to the length of time the complainant has been in the area;  the proximity of the complainant’s residence to the noise source, if the complainant’s residence is farther from the noise source than the distance specified for sound level investigations;  the relative level of ambient noise in the area of the alleged violation, if ambient noise is above the ordinance standard and the noise level of the source under investigation is close to the ambient noise level; and  4) any steps the alleged violator has taken to remedy the alleged violation.  I, Sadhu A. Jolmston, hereby promulgate the foregoing Environmental Noise and Vibration Control Rules and Regulations on this J day of January 2007.  Sadhu A.

Indicator Description   This indicator examines changes in the winter ranges of North American birds from the winter of 1966– 1967 to 2013. Changes in climate can affect ecosystems by influencing animal behavior and ranges. Birds  are a particularly strong indicator of environmental change for several reasons described in the indicator  text. This indicator focuses in particular on latitude—how far north or south birds travel—and distance  from the coast. Inland areas tend to experience more extreme cold than coastal areas, but birds may  shift inland over time as winter temperature extremes grow less severe.   Components of this indicator include:   •  Shifts in the latitude of winter ranges of North American birds over the past half-century   (Figure 1).   •  Shifts in the distance to the coast of winter ranges of North American birds over the past half-  century (Figure 2).   2.  Revision History   April 2010:   May 2014:    Indicator published.  Updated indicator with data through 2013.   Data Sources   3.  Data Sources   This indicator is based on data collected by the annual Christmas Bird Count (CBC), managed by the  National Audubon Society. Data used in this indicator are collected by citizen scientists who  systematically survey certain areas and identify and count widespread bird species. The CBC has been in  operation since 1900, but data used in this indicator begin in winter 1966–1967.   4.  Data Availability   Complete CBC data are available in both print and electronic formats. Historical CBC data have been  published in several periodicals—Audubon Field Notes, American Birds, and Field Notes—beginning in  1998. Additionally, historical, current year, and annual summary CBC data are available online at:  www.audubon.org/conservation/science/christmas-bird-count. Descriptions of data are available with  the data queried online. The appendix to National Audubon Society (2009) provides 40-year trends for  each species, but not the full set of data by year. EPA obtained the complete data set for this indicator,  with trends and species-specific data through 2013, directly from the National Audubon Society.   A similar analysis is available from an interagency consortium at: www.stateofthebirds.org/2010.    Technical Documentation: Bird Wintering Ranges   1   Methodology   5.  Data Collection   This indicator is based on data collected by the annual CBC, managed by the National Audubon Society.  Data used in this indicator are collected by citizen scientists who systematically survey certain areas and  identify and count widespread bird species. Although the indicator relies on human observation rather  than precise measuring instruments, the people who collect the data are skilled observers who follow  strict protocols that are consistent across time and space. These data have supported many peer- reviewed studies, a list of which can be found on the National Audubon Society’s website at:  www.audubon.org/conservation/christmas-bird-count-bibliography.   Bird surveys take place each year in approximately 2,000 different locations throughout the contiguous  48 states and the southern portions of Alaska and Canada. All local counts take place between  December 14 and January 5 of each winter. Each local count takes place over a 24-hour period in a  defined “count circle” that is 15 miles in diameter. A variable number of volunteer observers separate  into field parties, which survey different areas of the count circle and tally the total number of  individuals of each species observed (National Audubon Society, 2009). This indicator covers 305 bird  species, which are listed in Appendix 1 of National Audubon Society (2009). These species were included  because they are widespread and they met specific criteria for data availability.   The entire study description, including a list of species and a description of sampling methods and  analyses performed, can be found in National Audubon Society (2009) and references therein.  Information on this study is also available on the National Audubon Society website at:  http://web4.audubon.org/bird/bacc/techreport.html. For additional information on CBC survey design  and methods, see the reports classified as “Methods” in the list at:  http://www.audubon.org/conservation/christmas-bird-count-bibliography.   6.  Indicator Derivation   At the end of the 24-hour observation period, each count circle tallies the total number of individuals of  each species seen in the count circle. Audubon scientists then run the data through several levels of  analysis and quality control to determine final count numbers from each circle and each region. Data  processing steps include corrections for different levels of sampling effort—for example, if some count  circles had more observers and more person-hours of effort than others. Population trends over the 40- year period of this indicator and annual indices of abundance were estimated for the entire survey area  with hierarchical models in a Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques (National  Audubon Society, 2009).    This indicator is based on the center of abundance for each species, which is the center of the  population distribution at any point in time. In terms of latitude, half of the individuals in the population  live north of the center of abundance and the other half live to the south. Similarly, in terms of  longitude, half of the individuals live west of the center of abundance, and the other half live to the east.  The center of abundance is a common way to characterize the general location of a population. For  example, if a population were to shift generally northward, the center of abundance would be expected  to shift northward as well.   This indicator examines the center of abundance from two perspectives:   Technical Documentation: Bird Wintering Ranges   2   •   Latitude—testing the hypothesis that bird populations are moving northward along with the  observed rise in overall temperatures throughout North America.   •  Distance from coast—testing the hypothesis that bird populations are able to move further  from the coast as a generally warming climate moderates the inland temperature extremes  that would normally occur in the winter.   •  This indicator reports the position of the center of abundance for each year, relative to the  position of the center of abundance in 1966 (winter 1966–1967). The change in position is  averaged across all 305 species for changes in latitude (Figure 1) and across 272 species for  changes in distance from the coast (Figure 2). The indicator excludes 33 species from the  analysis of distance from the coast because these species depend on a saltwater or brackish  water habitat. Lake shorelines (including the Great Lakes) were not considered coastlines for  the purposes of the “distance from coast” metric.   •  Figures 1 and 2 show average distances moved north and moved inland, based on an   unweighted average of all species. Thus, no adjustments are made for population differences  across species.    No attempt was made to generate estimates outside the surveyed area. The indicator does not include  Mexico or northern parts of Alaska and Canada because data for these areas were too sparse to support  meaningful trend analysis. Due to its distance from the North American continent, Hawaii is also omitted  from the analysis. No attempt was made to estimate trends prior to 1966 (i.e., prior to the availability of  complete spatial coverage and standardized methods), and no attempt was made to project trends into  the future.   The entire study description, including analyses performed, can be found in National Audubon Society  (2009) and references therein. Information on this study is also available on the National Audubon  Society website at: http://web4.audubon.org/bird/bacc/techreport.html.   7.  Quality Assurance and Quality Control   As part of the overall data compilation effort, Audubon scientists have performed several statistical  analyses to ensure that potential error and variability are adequately addressed. Quality  assurance/quality control procedures are described in National Audubon Society (2009) and in a variety  of methodology reports listed at: www.audubon.org/conservation/christmas-bird-count-bibliography.   Analysis   8.  Comparability Over Time and Space   The CBC has been in operation since 1900, but data used in this indicator begin in winter 1966–1967.  The National Audubon Society chose this start date to ensure sufficient sample size throughout the  survey area as well as consistent methods, as the CBC design and methodology have remained generally  consistent since the 1960s. All local counts take place between December 14 and January 5 of each  winter, and they follow consistent methods regardless of the location.   Technical Documentation: Bird Wintering Ranges   3   9.  Data Limitations   Factors that may impact the confidence, application, or conclusions drawn from this indicator are as  follows:   1.  Many factors can influence bird ranges, including food availability, habitat alteration, and   interactions with other species. Some of the birds covered in this indicator might have moved  northward or inland for reasons other than changing temperatures.   2.  This indicator does not show how responses to climate change vary among different types of  birds. For example, National Audubon Society (2009) found large differences between coastal  birds, grassland birds, and birds adapted to feeders, which all have varying abilities to adapt to  temperature changes. This Audubon report also shows the large differences between individual  species—some of which moved hundreds of miles while others did not move significantly at all.   3.  Some data variations are caused by differences between count circles, such as inconsistent   level of effort by volunteer observers, but these differences are carefully corrected in  Audubon’s statistical analysis.   4.  While observers attempt to identify and count every bird observed during the 24-hour   observation period, rare and nocturnal species may be undersampled. Gregarious species (i.e.,  species that tend to gather in large groups) can also be difficult to count, and they could be  either overcounted or undercounted, depending on group size and the visibility of their roosts.  These species tend to congregate in known and expected locations along CBC routes, however,  so observers virtually always know to check these spots. Locations with large roosts are often  assigned to observers with specific experience in estimating large numbers of birds.    5.  The tendency for saltwater-dependent species to stay near coastlines could impact the change   in latitude calculation for species living near the Gulf of Mexico. By integrating these species  into the latitudinal calculation, Figure 1 may understate the total extent of northward  movement of species.   10. Sources of Uncertainty   The sources of uncertainty in this indicator have been analyzed, quantified, and accounted for to the  extent possible. The statistical significance of the trends suggests that the conclusions one might draw  from this indicator are robust.   One potential source of uncertainty in these data is uneven effort among count circles. Various studies  that discuss the best ways to account for this source of error have been published in peer-reviewed  journals. Link and Sauer (1999) describe the methods that Audubon used to account for variability in  effort.    11. Sources of Variability   Rare or difficult-to-observe bird species could lead to increased variability. For this analysis, the National  Audubon Society included only 305 widespread bird species that met criteria for abundance and the  availability of data to enable the detection of meaningful trends.   Technical Documentation: Bird Wintering Ranges   4   12. Statistical/Trend Analysis   Appendix 1 of National Audubon Society (2009) documents the statistical significance of trends in the  wintering range for each species included in an earlier version of this indicator. Using annual data points  for each species, EPA applied an ordinary least-squares regression to determine the statistical  significance of each species’ movement, as well as the statistical significance of each overall trend.  Tables TD-1 and TD-2 present these two analyses. Both of these tables are based on an analysis of all  305 species that the National Audubon Society studied.      Table TD-1. Statistical Analyses of Aggregate (All Species) Trends   Indicator component   Regression slope   P-value   Total miles   moved   Northward (latitude)   0.993 miles/year   Inward from the coast   0.231 miles/year   <0.0001   <0.0001   46.7   10.9   Statistical calculation   Table TD-2.

The shaded bands in Figures 1 and 2 show 95 percent upper and lower credible intervals, which are  Bayesian statistical outputs that are analogous to 95 percent confidence intervals.    Other published studies have also found evidence of shifts in bird wintering ranges over time using  these data. For example, La Sorte and Thompson (2007) analyzed long-term data from the CBC and  concluded that ranges have shifted northward, even after accounting for various regional influences.

This letter   stated that the 17th District Police Commander had objected to the issuance of the Late Hour   liquor license on grounds it will cause a law enforcement problem in the area.  After considering   that fact, the Commission found that the public interest would be best served by denying this   applicant the requested license at this location.  The letter cited the Chicago Municipal Code (4-  60-040) which allows the Local Liquor Control Commissioner to deny an application for a city   liquor dealer’s license if the issuance of the license would tend to create a law enforcement   problem.  The applicant filed a timely appeal with this Commission.          As this case deals with a denial of a license, this Commission is charged with the   responsibility of determining de novo the propriety of that denial.          1      The City of Chicago has prosecuted denials of licenses based on law enforcement   concerns in different manners.  On one scenario, it presents evidence that the particular applicant   has had a history of not following liquor laws or the law in general.  Since that particular   applicant has shown this tendency in the past, it is reasonable to believe that applicant would not   follow the law if granted a new or additional liquor license.  This is the type of factual setting in   the Vino Fino case.          A second approach to law enforcement cases is to show not that not that the individual   applicant would violate liquor laws or the law in general, but that the location of the applicant’s   premises is such that the issuance of a liquor license of any type to any individual or corporation   would tend to create a law enforcement problem or to aggravate existing law enforcement   problems.  Evidence in these type cases usually comes with the police department’s records of   the number of calls for service and the number of crimes in the area of the applicant premises.    Evidence can also come from personal observations of community residents and elected officials   as to what the present conditions are and how a new or additional license would tend to   aggravate existing law enforcement problems.  This is the type of evidence presented in the M.J.   Ontario case.           Whether the City proceeds to hearing on either of those scenarios or any other such   theory the laws require the City to prove its case on some evidence.  Pure speculation that there   will be a law enforcement problem in the future cannot support a denial for a liquor license.          2      The record in this case contains the testimony of the 17th District Commander Melissa   Staples.  Her live testimony is that there have been no law enforcement problems with the   applicant since they have had their liquor license, as there was only one call for service from that   location and that call was made by the applicant.  The Commander did not present any statistical   evidence to support the denial.  The letter she wrote to Gregory Steadman was allowed in   evidence.  That letter states that it was her opinion, on the date she wrote the letter, that   extending the sale of alcohol at this premise would have a deleterious impact on the health,   safety and welfare of surrounding community by increasing the risk of violations of the law.  A   letter with an opinion not supported by evidence and with an opinion not stated at this hearing   cannot support the denial of this license.            Ms. Patel from Alderman Silverstein’s office did testify that the Alderman was opposed   to the issuance of this license.  While this Commission respects the opinion of Aldermen with   respect to issuance of liquor licenses, Aldermanic opposition alone without supporting evidence   such as was presented on the M.J. Ontario case is not sufficient to uphold the denial of this   license.          While not specifically mentioned at the hearing, it appears that subsequent to the filing of   this application the Municipal Code was amended to impose a moratorium on late hour licenses   in the 50th Ward.  Since this application predated the passage of the moratorium, the moratorium   does not apply to this application.          3      The City has failed to meets its burden of proof that the issuance of this late hour license   would tend to create a law enforcement problem.  The denial of the late hour license is reversed.                                                                      4   THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED That the said order or action of the Local      Liquor Control Commissioner of the City of Chicago be and the same hereby is REVERSED.

The date of the mailing of this order  is deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the  Circuit Court, the petition for rehearing must be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days  after service of this order as such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

In  a letter to our office dated  June  10, 2006, you  requested  an  opinion  addressing  how  the  City's  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance applies to your representation  of plaintiffs in two  legal proceedings in  which  the  City is  a named  defendant.  Based  on  the  facts  you  presented,  staff  concludes  that  the  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  you  from  representing  the  individuals  in  these  proceedings, although, as  you  are  aware,  it  does  prohibit  you  from  having  an  economic  interest  in  (i.e.  deriving  any  compensation  or  other  that  representation or those matters.  You  explained to staff that you  are deriving or  accepting  no  compensation  from  either  matter,  and  that  you  have  a  fee  screening  arrangement  in  place  for  one  of  the  matters;  as  long  as  these  conditions  remain  true,  your  representation  in  both  proceedings,  as  you  have  described  it, is  in  compliance with the  requirements  of the  relevant provision of  the Ordinance.   interest  capable  of  being  valued   in  monetary  terms   from)   [K   is  pending  before   involve  legal  You  explained  that  none  of  your  duties  as  [in  U]  representation  of the  City or [U]  In  your capacity as  an  attorney (you  maintain  ),  you  currently represent  a law practice: the Law Office of [John  Smith]  In  the  first,  your  client  is  a  [U]  employees  in  two  distinct  legal  proceedings.  v.

This  proceeding  Illinois  the  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Department  of  Human  Rights  and  In  the second case,  pending  in  the Circuit Court of Cook County,  Commission.  (captioned  [N  v.  H]  ),  there  are  two  counts.  The  first  count,  in  which you  have filed an  appearance on  behalf of and  represent the  plaintiff, is a  civil suit for libel against another [U] employee in  her personal capacity; the City  is  not  a  party.  The  second  count  involves  allegations  by  this  same  plaintiff  against the same  [U]  employee,  in  her official  capacity,  and  the  City.  You  said  that  another  attorney,  [Mr.  F)  (who  is  listed  as  ""Of  Counsel""  to  the  Law  Office  of  [John  Smith]  )  represents  the  plaintiff  in  this  second  count-you  do  not  represent  the  plaintiff  in  that  count.  You  explained  to  staff  that two separate lawsuits could  have been filed  in  this matter,  but that one was  filed  for administrative  reasons.  You  also  said  that,  in  both  the  [K and N v.  H]  matters,  you  are  accepting  no  compensation-they  are  entirely  pro  bono.  Further,  you  explained, there  is  a fee  screening  arrangement in  place  between  in the [N v. H] matter-you will accept no direct or indirect  you and Mr. [F)  compensation  (such  as  substituted  payments)  from  [Mr.  F)  or  [Mr.  N]  with  respect to any recovery made or fees charged.   Section  2-156-090 of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance provides,  in  relevant part:   Case No. 06034.0  June 21,  2006  Page 2   (b)  No  elected  official  or  employee  may  have  an  economic  interest  in  the  representation  of,  any  person,  in  any judicial  or  quasi-judicial  proceeding  before  any  administrative agency or court in  which the City is a party and  that person's interest is  adverse to that of the City.   ""Economic interest"" is  defined at 2-156-010(i) of the  Ordinance as"" ... any interest valued  or capable  of valuation in  monetary terms.""  Under§ 090(b}, you,  as a City employee,  are prohibited from  having  an  economic  interest  in  the  representation  of any  person  in  any judicial  or  quasi-judicial  proceeding  before  any  administrative  agency  or  court  in  which  the  City  is  a  party  and  that  person's  interest  is  adverse to that of the City.  Clearly,  both the [ K and N v.  H]  matters meet the  criterion of§ 090(b).  Therefore,  Board  staff  concludes  that,  although  §  2-156-090(b)  does  not  prohibit  you  from  representing  the  plaintiffs/claimants  in  these  cases,  it  does  prohibit  you  from  having  an  economic  interest  in  that  representation-meaning  that  you  are  prohibited  from  accepting,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  anything  of value for your  legal  representation  in  either lawsuit,  including  any  replacement  payments or other compensation stemming from  [Mr.  F's] representation of the plaintiff in  the [N v.  H]  matter.  See Case No.  95004.A.  You  explained to staff that you  have taken  on  both  representations  completely  pro  bono; moreover,  you  said,  you  have  a fee  screening  arrangement with  [Mr.  F] under  which you  have fully disclaimed any recovery or fees  he collects in the [N v.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,834 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Oakley Avenue, from W.  Addison Street to W. Cornelia Avenue, in N. Claremont Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W.  School Street, and in W. Roscoe Street, from N. Western Avenue to N. Leavitt Street.  The old  pipe dates back to 1889, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Waguespack’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Scott Waguespack             32nd Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                    Do you wonder what was happening in 1889?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                      Hull House                Hull House was opened by Miss Jane Addams at 800 S. Halsted, helping hundreds of   Chicago immigrants gain a place of self-respect in society.     The first train load of fruit, oranges, left Los Angeles for the east coast.    Benjamin Harrison won the American presidency despite Grover Cleveland’s larger share   of the popular vote.      The first concrete reinforced bridge was built.    The Chicago Auditorium opened. President Harrison made a visit.    Charlie Chaplin was born.    Bayer introduced aspirin in powder form, in Germany.    The first jukeboxes were placed in bars and arcades.    The Wall Street Journal began publication.    The Oklahoma land rush officially started.                         WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,834 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Oakley Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W. Cornelia Avenue, in N.  Claremont Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W. School Street, and in W. Roscoe Street, from  N. Western Avenue to N. Leavitt Street.      Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1889 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in September. Final restoration will follow in October. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN SCOTT WAGUESPACK   773- 248-1330      PETE SCALES    DEPARTMENT OF WATER MANAGEMENT   312-744-8822                               FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in September. Final  restoration will follow in October. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at  the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
