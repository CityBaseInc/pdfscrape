Prior to your retirement from City service on July 1, 1998, you were [ the manager of Program Beta, within Bureau 1, Department C             ]. After retiring, you accepted a position as a consultant with [a consulting firm                                                                                  ] that has contracts with [Department C].  You have asked whether the post-employment restrictions of the Ethics Ordinance prohibit you from working as a consultant for [the consulting firm] on its contracts to assist in [   Department D’s Alpha projects with Department C                                                                   ].  Based on the facts presented by you and [Michael                ], it is the Board’s opinion that the Ethics Ordinance prohibits you, for one year from the date you left City service, from assisting or representing [the consulting firm] on any [Alpha] project on which you worked as a City employee.  However, the Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit you from assisting or representing [the consulting  firm]  on  [Alpha]  projects  on  which  you  did  not  work  as  a [Department C] employee.  A statement of the facts, the relevant provisions of the Ethics Ordinance and the Board’s analysis follow.  FACTS:    First,  we  describe  your  responsibilities  when  you  were  a  City employee; second, we discuss the [Alpha] program; third, we outline [the consulting firm’s] contract with  [Department C]; finally, we explain your responsibilities with [the consulting firm].  Your responsibilities as a City employee:  In a meeting with Board staff on October 27, 1998, you explained that as the [manager of Program Beta   ], you were responsible for implementing the program until you retired from City service on July 1, 1998. [Program Beta                ] provides residents of the City with [certain infrastructure improvements                            ].  Case No. 98053.A December 16, 1998 Page 2  The [Alpha] Program: The [Alpha program] was created by [Department D                                           ].  Under the program, [Department D ]           solicits applications for infrastructure improvements from owners of commercial, retail and industrial buildings. [    [Department D                 ] coordinates the [Alpha] application process, soliciting, reviewing, approving or rejecting all applications.    All City funds for [Alpha] projects come from [Department D’s                ] budget.  ].  Both you and [Michael] stated that you did not participate in the creation of the [Alpha] program; nor  were  you  involved  in  the  application  process.    Instead,  your  involvement  with  the  [Alpha] program was limited, comprising only a very small part of your responsibilities.  Approximately eight times during 1997 and 1998, [Department D] asked that [Department C’s Bureau 1]  assist it by performing field studies on [Alpha] applications [          ]. In response to [Department D’s          ] request, you were directed by [Michael                  ]  to dispatch either a City engineer from [Program Beta                      ] or a private engineering contractor working for  [Department  C1]  to  perform  an  engineering  field  study  and  cost  estimate  on  the  [Alpha] application.2    After  you  or  [Michael]  reviewed  the  field  study,  it  was  sent  to  [Department  D]. [Department D] would then decide whether to approve the request.  If [Department D] elected to proceed on [an Alpha] application on which [Program Beta  ] had performed a field study, you were responsible for assigning an engineer — either a City employee or an engineering contractor — to oversee the project.  These engineers directly supervised the work and reported to you.  The actual construction was performed by private construction firms on contract with [Department C].  Because [Department C] has divided the City into 11 areas and assigns one contractor to each area, neither you nor [Michael] had the authority to select among the various contractors.  Instead, contractors were assigned according to the geographic location of the site. [Department C] field supervisors completed the paperwork allowing private contractors to be paid. You approved private contractors’ payment vouchers.  You and [Michael] stated that [the consulting firm] was not involved in the [Alpha] projects on which you worked as a City employee.  1In 1997, private contractors conducted the field study of [Department D]-selected sites.  As a cost-saving measure, [Department D] asked [Department C] to use engineers from its [Program Beta] to conduct these field studies in 1998.  2The field study typically included the site’s measurements, grade, elevation and drainage.  If appropriate, diagonal parking and feasibility issues were also addressed in the field report.  Case No. 98053.A December 16, 1998 Page 3  [The consulting firm’s] contract with [Department C]: [The consulting firm], is an engineering consulting firm.  In June 1998, [the consulting firm] and [Department C] entered into a three-year contract allowing [Department C] to use [the consulting firm] on an as-needed basis.  This kind of contract, sometimes referred to as a D.U.R. (depending on requirements), allows [Department C] to assign [the consulting firm’s] personnel to various projects operating in any of [Department C’s bureaus].    This  contract  was  negotiated  by  the  City’s  Law  and  Purchasing  Departments  and [Michael]. [Michael] stated that you had no input in formulating this contract.  Your  responsibilities  with  [the  consulting  firm]:    You  began  working  as  a  [consultant  for  the consulting firm] on July 13, 1998.  You said that [the consulting firm] assigned you to work under its contract with [Department C] conducting field surveys and preparing construction cost estimates for [Alpha] projects.  On any given [Alpha] project, you may also be asked to secure approval from [Department C’s Bureau 2] for a proposed [change                    ], or to seek City Council approval of any necessary amendment to a City ordinance to allow [ change               ].  LAW, ANALYSIS, AND DETERMINATIONS:  Post-Employment  Restrictions:    Former  City  employees  are  not  prohibited  by  the  City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance from working for any particular new employer, but the Ordinance does  restrict  the  activities  which  former  City  employees  may  perform  for  their  new  employers. Section 2-156-100(b) of the Ordinance provision governing post-employment restrictions states:  No  former  official  or  employee  shall,  for  a  period  of  one  year  after  the termination of the official’s or employee’s term of office or employment, assist or represent any person in any business transaction involving the City or any of its agencies, if the official or employee participated personally and substantially in the subject matter of the transaction during his term of office or employment; provided,  that  if  the  official  or  employee  exercised  contract  management authority with the respect to a contract this prohibition shall be permanent as to that contract.  Under  this  provision,  former  City  employees  are  subject  to  both  a  one-year  prohibition  and  a permanent prohibition after leaving City service.  For one year after leaving City employment, former employees are prohibited from assisting or representing any person in a business transaction involving the City or any of its agencies if they participated personally and substantially in the subject matter of  that  transaction  during  their  City  employment.    The  one-year  prohibition  begins  the  day  an employee leaves City employment, not on the date the employee stops performing a particular task. Former City employees are also permanently prohibited from assisting or representing any person in any  contract  if,  as  a  City  employee,  they  exercised  “contract  management  authority”  over  that contract.  We will analyze each prohibition in turn.  Case No. 98053.A December 16, 1998 Page 4  One-year prohibition:  Section 2-156-100(b) of the Ethics Ordinance prohibits you, through June 30, 1999, from assisting or representing [the consulting firm], or any other person, in a business transaction involving the City if you participated personally and substantially in the subject matter of that transaction during your City employment.  “Assisting”  and  “representing”  includes  helping  a  person  perform  a  contract.    As  a  consultant working for [the consulting firm], you are assisting [the consulting firm] perform its contract — a kind of business transaction — with the City.  The Ethics Ordinance defines “person” to include corporations, partnerships, firms and associations.  § 2-156-010(r).  You stated that [the consulting firm] is a corporation.  Therefore, under the Ordinance, [the consulting firm] is a “person” whom you are assisting in a business transaction involving the City.  Subject matter of the transaction:  To determine how the one-year prohibition applies to you, the Board must first ascertain the subject matter of the business transactions on which [the consulting firm] has asked you to work.  In some recent cases involving construction or development of real property, the Board has analyzed subject matter as the application of a City program to particular sites.   For example, in Case No. 98020.A, the Board held that a former employee who coordinated the supervision of field construction for City development projects was prohibited for one year from assisting or representing any person in a business transaction involving the City if the subject matter of the transaction was the application of the particular City construction program to any site on which he had worked with that program as a City employee.  (See also Case Nos. 96001.A, 96015.A, 96024.A.)  By  contrast,  in  Case  No.  93038.A,  the  Director  of  a  City  program  asked  the  Board  for  general guidance on the restrictions imposed by the Governmental Ethics Ordinance on the work he could undertake upon leaving City employ.  Noting that the Director of the City program established the program’s policies, coordinated each stage of the program and was substantially involved in all areas of the program, the Board determined that the Ethics Ordinance prohibited the Director for one year after leaving City employment from assisting or representing any person in any matter involving that program.  In  your  case,  unlike  the  director  of  the  City  program  who  established  the  program’s  policies, coordinated each stage of the City program and was substantially involved in all areas of the program, you were not the director of [Department D’s Alpha           ] program.  You did not develop or implement the application, screening or selection process.  You did not have authority to approve design  or  cost  estimates  for  the  program  or  any  specific  [Alpha]  project.    Instead,  you  were responsible  for  the  execution  of  specific  aspects  of  the  [Alpha]  program  at  sites  selected  by [Department D].  Therefore, in analyzing how the Ordinance’s one-year prohibition applies to you, the Board concludes that each [Alpha] project constitutes a distinct subject matter.  Case No. 98053.A December 16, 1998 Page 5  Personal and substantial involvement:  You stated that you supervised the engineers who performed the initial field studies of particular [Alpha] project sites.  Both [Department C] field supervisors and private contractors working as field supervisors who managed the [Alpha] projects reported to you. You approved the vouchers which allowed private contractors to be paid for their work on [Alpha] projects.  On these facts, the Board concludes that you participated personally and substantially in the [Alpha] projects on which you worked as a City employee.  Therefore, the Board concludes that the Ordinance prohibits you, for one-year, from assisting or representing any person, including [the consulting firm], in any [Alpha] project you worked on as a City employee.  In contrast, the Board concludes that the one-year prohibition does not prohibit you from working for [the consulting firm] on [Alpha] projects with which you were not involved as a City employee.  Permanent prohibition:  Section 2-156-100(b) of the Ethics Ordinance permanently prohibits you from assisting or representing [the consulting firm], or any other person, in performing its contract with the City if, during the course of your City employment, you exercised “contract management authority” over that contract.  Contract management authority is defined by the Ethics Ordinance as:  personal involvement in or direct supervisory responsibility for the formulation or execution of a City contract, including without limitation the preparation of specifications, evaluation of bids or proposals, negotiation of contract terms or supervision of performance. § 2-156-010(g).  Both [the consulting firm’s] contract with [Department C] and the contracts which [Department C] entered into to complete the eight [Alpha] projects on which you worked are at issue.  [The consulting firm] contract with Department C:  As explained above, [the consulting firm] has an  D.U.R.  contract  with  [Department  C  ]  which  it  entered  into  in  June  1998.    Both  you  and [Michael] stated that when you were a City employee you did not select, participate in contract preparations or negotiations or execute [the consulting firm] contract.  From these facts, the Board concludes  that  you  did  not  exercise  contract  management  authority  over  the  D.U.R.  contract between [Department C] and [the consulting firm].  Therefore, under the Ordinance’s permanent prohibition, you are not prohibited from working on [the consulting firm’s] D.U.R. contract with [Department C] provided, that as [the consulting firm] consultant, you do not assist or represent [the consulting firm] on any [Alpha] project you worked on as a City employee.  [Alpha] project site contracts: The individual [Alpha] projects with which you were involved in your City job do not require analysis under the permanent prohibition. Since these projects do not last for more than one year, and since the one-year prohibition already applies to any project with which you were involved in your City job, the Board does not find it necessary to address at this time whether you exercised contract management authority over any of those projects, and whether you thus might be prohibited from assisting or representing any person with respect to them following the one- year period after your retirement from City service. If, however, one of those projects does last for  Case No. 98053.A December 16, 1998 Page 6  more than a year after your retirement from City employment, and you are requested as a non-City employee to assist on such a project, we advise you to contact the Board for further guidance.   Confidential Information:  Finally, we also advise that Section 2-156-070 of the Ethics Ordinance, “Use or Disclosure of Confidential Information,” prohibits all current and former employees from using and disclosing any confidential information gained in the course of their City employment. Confidential information is defined by the Ethics Ordinance as any information that may not be obtained pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, as amended.  DETERMINATIONS: The Board determines that:  1.  2.  3.  4.  in analyzing how the Ordinance’s one-year prohibition applies to you, each [Alpha] project constitutes a distinct subject matter;  you participated personally and substantially in the [Alpha] projects on which you worked as a City employee and, therefore, the Ordinance prohibits you, for one year, from assisting or  representing  any  person,  including  [the  consulting  firm],  in  any  [Alpha]  project  you worked on as a City employee;  the Ordinance’s one-year prohibition does not prohibit you from working for [the consulting firm] on [Alpha] projects with which you were not involved as a City employee; and  the  Ordinance’s  permanent  prohibition  does  not  prohibit  you  from  working  on  [the consulting firm’s] D.U.R. contract with [Department C] provided that, as [the consulting firm consultant], you do not assist or represent [the consulting firm] on any [Alpha] project you worked on as a City employee.  Our determinations in this case are based on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts presented are incorrect or incomplete, please notify the Board immediately as any change in the facts may alter our opinion.  Additionally, other laws or rules also may apply to this situation.   RELIANCE:  This opinion may be relied on by any person involved in the specific transaction or activity discussed above or any person involved in a transaction or activity that is indistinguishable in all material aspects from the above-described transaction or activity.  ________________________________________ Darryl L.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 5,119 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Kimball Avenue, from  W. Fullerton Avenue to W. Armitage Avenue, W. Lyndale Street, from N. Central Park Avenue  to N. Kimball Avenue, W. Shakespeare Avenue, from N. St. Louis Avenue to N. Kimball  Avenue, and N. St. Louis Avenue, from W. Lyndale Street to W. Shakespeare Avenue. The old  pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Colόn’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:          CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                                KIMBALL AVE., LYNDALE ST., SHAKESPEARE AVE. & ST. LOUIS AVE.    WATER PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 5,119 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Kimball Avenue, from W. Fullerton Avenue to W. Armitage Avenue, W.  Lyndale Street, from N. Central Park Avenue to N. Kimball Avenue, W. Shakespeare Avenue,  from N. St. Louis Avenue to N. Kimball Avenue, and N. St. Louis Avenue, from W. Lyndale  Street to W. Shakespeare Avenue.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in early March 2015. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Kimball Avenue, W. Lyndale Street, W.  Shakespeare Avenue, and N. St. Louis Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are  working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able  to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                                              CONTACT NUMBERS   ALDERMAN REY COLÓN   773-365-3535       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in early  March 2015. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Chicago Safe Havens Demonstration Site – Accounting for Culture in Supervised Visitation Practices          - 3 -   Summary and Recommendations      As part of their participation as a demonstration site for the Safe Havens Supervised Visitation  and Safe Exchange Program,1 three Chicago visitation centers and their collaborative partner, the  Mayor(cid:146)s Office on Domestic Violence, explored how the current design, processes, and  procedures of visitation and exchange centers account for aspects of culture. The centers are  programs of Apna Ghar, The Branch Family Institute (Branch), and Mujeres Latinas en Acci(cid:243)n  (Mujeres). Representatives from each center, the city office, and Praxis documented each  center(cid:146)s efforts to account for their clients(cid:146) cultural and economic backgrounds.     Using focus groups, interviews with parents and staff, observations, and group readings of  redacted case files, we documented current center practices that account for the cultural  differences of families coming to the centers and, in particular, that account for their experiences  with race and class oppression.     We started the discussion with this question, selected by the Chicago demonstration site partners:  How does culture play a role in serving families using supervised visitation? At one level, our  question had a ready answer: of course (cid:147)culture(cid:148) plays a role in supervised visitation. Everything  not of the natural world is cultural, constructed within a particular world view, language, values,  and norms. There is no such thing as culturally neutral supervised visitation and exchange.  Everything visitation centers do has cultural dimensions and impact. It is not a matter of saying  that this intake is influenced by culture, but that exchange is not; or, this family has culture,  while this family does not. It is a matter of understanding how to recognize the cultural  dimensions and impacts of the ways in which centers are organized, and which culture influences  the program.    Each of the Chicago centers is grounded in a larger organization that formed within a cultural- specific context and purpose. Each center serves families from multiple cultural backgrounds,  although this is less true for Mujeres. The centers tweak, alter, and shape aspects of the  prevailing model of supervised visitation in ways that recognize the different life experiences  and cultural identities of the parents and children coming through their doors. At the same time,  the procedures, policies, forms, and documentation look much like that of most supervised  visitation and exchange centers throughout the country. We found that the prevailing model of  organizing visitation services is so pervasive and familiar that it is difficult for someone in the  day-to-day practice of a visitation center to imagine alternatives.2 We were not able, for example,  to get very far in articulating what it would look like if we had to come up with a way for one  parent who was battering another to spend time with his children in a way that was safe for  everyone, but without using a center, in the generic space and shape that we know. Different                                                    1 The Safe Havens: Supervised Visitation and Safe Exchange Grant Program, established by the Violence Against  Women Act of 2000, provides an opportunity for communities to support supervised visitation and safe exchange of  children, by and between parents, in situations involving domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, or stalking.  The four Demonstration Sites (cid:150) in Chicago, Michigan (Pontiac, Jackson, Traverse City, and Muskegon), California  (San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz Counties), and Washington (City of Kent) (cid:150) have paid close attention to  visitation and exchange in the context of domestic violence, and to collaboration between visitation centers,  domestic violence advocacy organizations, and the courts.  2 (cid:147)We(cid:148) in this paper is the collective we: the Chicago centers, project directors, and the Praxis technical assistance  partners.   Chicago Safe Havens Demonstration Site – Accounting for Culture in Supervised Visitation Practices          - 4 -   cultures might have entirely different ways of being safe and ensuring safety. Articulating what  those different ways and ideas might be is one of the next steps in the continuing discussion. We  put that project aside for another day and decided to focus on what was occurring in the centers.     We found numerous examples of (cid:147)cultural humility(cid:148) in action, however, and used the concept to  frame much of our discussion. The notion of cultural humility was not a product of our inquiry,  but a framework that resonated with the Chicago centers in exploring center practices and  cultural differences.3 Cultural humility (cid:147)incorporates a lifelong commitment to self-evaluation  and self-critique(cid:148) and (cid:147)advocacy partnerships with communities,(cid:148) as (cid:147)reflective practitioners(cid:148)  and with (cid:147)self-reflection and self-critique at the institutional level.(cid:148)  Cultural humility (cid:147)involves  the curiosity and motivation to understand the web of meaning in which children and families  live, and the reflective capacity to examine our own cultural values and assumptions. It requires  a commitment to appreciating similarities and differences between our own culturally shaped  goals and priorities and those of the children and families we care for. It requires as well an  obligation to (cid:145)rein in(cid:146) [our] power and authority (cid:133) so that the voices of children and family  members can be fully valued and heard.(cid:148) (Browning, 2004)     Each of the centers has a keen awareness of people(cid:146)s everyday experiences with oppression.  Center staff describe their role as facilitating the process of visitation in ways that maximize  safety for battered parents and their children, while minimizing the center becoming just another  obstacle for families.      Often I ask myself, and so does the staff ask: What are my biases? What is it about this culture   we live in that makes things difficult for a family? What do I think of this culture? We   individually acknowledge that we do not know all answers, thus we have to ask, when we do not   know, and this only helps us to help the families. We are willing to learn, willing to accept   feedback. It is [crucial] to ask and never to assume.    (cid:150)  Visitation center director      We don’t want to become one more of the oppressors. (cid:150) Visitation center staff        Our experience exploring aspects of culture in supervised visitation led us to the following  recommendations, offered as a guide to centers in thinking about how to build cultural humility  into their organization and practice. We want to emphasize that this is only the beginning of a  much larger, ongoing discussion of culturally responsive visitation practices.                                                       3 Melanie Tervalon and Jann Murray-Garc(cid:237)a, Cultural Humility Versus Cultural Competence: A Critical Distinction  in Defining Physician Training Outcomes in Multicultural Education, Journal of Health Care for the Poor and  Underserved, 9:2, 117-125, 1998. For Tervalon and Murray-Garc(cid:237)a the qualities of cultural (cid:147)humility(cid:148) include  respect, dialogue, awareness, and reflection. While their article centers on health care, the Chicago centers found  that the authors(cid:146) discussion of cultural humility resonated with how the centers(cid:146) approach their work.

Practice ongoing study, self-reflection, and self-critique, both institutionally and   individually.     2.  Ground your work in historical context and understand how people and their cultural  beliefs as well as behaviors have been excluded, silenced, denied, marginalized, and  oppressed.      3.  Design deliberately, in the staff, building, access, and dØcor; from the pictures on the   walls to the greeting at the door.     4.  Examine every form, policy, procedure, brochure, and directive and question its cultural   framework, assumptions, and language, and identify which culture it privileges.     5.  Learn about the communities you are and will be serving; make connections, find   teachers, and teach yourself.     6.  Include the communities you are and will be serving; provide a place at the table, via   inclusion as staff, board members, trainers, and consultants.     7.  Form and maintain advocacy partnerships; involve communities in crafting and defining   policies, not just commenting.     8.  Never ask a single individual, a single voice, to represent all of any community.   9.  Provide services in a person(cid:146)s first voice, in their home language.   10. Learn and practice respectful listening and genuine dialogue.   11. Support families(cid:146) cultural traditions.               12. To be discovered . . . We are not presenting our experience in Chicago as the final or only   word on building culturally responsive supervised visitation and exchange. Ongoing  work in Chicago and other communities (cid:150) the (cid:147)lifelong commitment to self-evaluation  and self-critique,(cid:148) (cid:150) will lead to ideas and approaches that we have yet to discover.      But  how to do this? None of these facets of cultural humility stand alone. They are intertwined  and interdependent. There is no single formula, recipe, or seminar to follow. There is no single  set of specific, finite tasks and skills that can be mastered. The how is a way of thinking about  things that leads to concrete changes in a center(cid:146)s mission, design, and daily practice.     We are all cultural beings, familiar with our own behavior, art, beliefs, language, institutions, and  other aspects of culture. The concept of cultural humility requires that we step out of this  familiarity; it requires a commitment to reflection and questioning, on an institutional level as  well as individuals.    Chicago Safe Havens Demonstration Site – Accounting for Culture in Supervised Visitation Practices          - 6 -   To connect with them from a basis of respect does not mean abandoning battered mothers  and their children, or ignoring the ways in which children might be used as a tactic of  battering. The Chicago centers are not na(cid:239)ve about the very real danger that some battering  parents can pose. They attempt to avoid lumping every visiting or non-custodial parent  into a single category, however.     ! Use staff meetings, ad hoc work groups, community members, and parents to help  examine every aspect of the center’s design and the implied and explicit messages  about who is welcome and how they are valued.     For the Chicago centers, non-threatening locations (alongside health care offices, a bank  building, and community center) are important in conveying respect, along with careful  consideration of the placement and use of such security measures as uniformed guards and  metal detectors. Formality in how people are addressed is also part of how the centers  welcome people and show respect, such as using Mr., Mrs., Miss, or Ms, or Usted, Seæor  or Seæora.     When there is a gap between the center staff(cid:146)s background and that of the parents using  the center, invite community members to help review the center(cid:146)s location, space,  furnishings, magazines, art work, intake appointments, and visitation and exchange  procedures. Invite parents to help inform understanding of the center(cid:146)s design and impact,  via focus groups, questionnaires, or other avenues.       ! Prepare staff to support parents and children to lead with the language of their   choice.    Siblings discussing their homework together may want to use English, for example, but  this requires that center staff help their parent understand the conversation.      ! Provide opportunities for extended family to be involved.     As the Chicago centers have experienced, this can occur within the context of safety for a  battered parent and her children, and any restrictions in court orders or sexual abuse  issues. In consultation with and approval from the custodial parents, visiting parents have  brought other family members to celebrate a birthday or join them for the visit. (cid:147)Family(cid:148)  for some parents and children includes a wide circle of relatives, close friends, and  godparents.   ! Hold an all-center gathering to help bridge cultures and contribute to an atmosphere   of warmth and respect for families.    Again, this occurs within the context of safety, the specifics of court orders, and  availability of adequate supervision. One center, for example, has an annual dinner the  week of Thanksgiving, with visiting parents, children, and other family members in one  area (with several staff members) and custodial parents in another.             Chicago Safe Havens Demonstration Site – Accounting for Culture in Supervised Visitation Practices          - 8 -   20th century, hundreds of thousands of African-Americans settled in Chicago, building the base  for one of the country(cid:146)s strongest African-American communities, and nearly 37% of the city(cid:146)s  current population. In the last census, 26% identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino, and  Chicago is the second largest Polish city in the world, outside of Warsaw.     In 1992, nearly all of the net growth in the Chicago metropolitan area labor force was due to  immigration, with the leading countries including Mexico (582,028 persons), Poland (137,670),  and India (76,931). Approximately two-thirds of the metro population growth between 1990 and  2000 may be attributed to immigration, which has been a significant factor in Cook County,  which includes Chicago. Immigrants come with extraordinary diversity of experience, tradition,  education, literacy, English proficiency, and income. For example, poverty rates range from  23.1% among those coming primarily as refuges from Bosnia and Herzegovinia to 2.2% for  Filipino immigrants. Most new residents from India (65.8%) have a college degree, in contrast to  only 4.3% of those from Mexico, (Paral & Norkewicz, 2003).    The Chicago region is not adding new housing where it is adding new jobs. While nearly a third  of renters pay more than 35% of their income for housing, 20% pay more than half. Since 1995,  16,068 units of public housing in Chicago have been demolished and only 1,296 units created;  only 10% of the affordable housing need is currently met. In 2003, domestic violence was the  immediate cause of homelessness for 22% of women in Chicago homeless shelters. 56% of  women in homeless shelters reported that they had been victims of domestic violence. Chicago  has only 154 domestic violence shelter beds. Almost 45% of homeless residents of Chicago are  families with children. (Coalition for the Homeless, 2004-05). According to the 2000 Census,  nearly 17% of Chicago families live below the official poverty level. For female householders  with children under eighteen years, over 40% live below the set poverty level; even a higher  percentage are in this predicament when children are under five.    This dip into the multiple backgrounds and experiences of Chicago(cid:146)s communities captures only  a fragment of the complexity of this big, diverse city. It provides a sense, however, of aspects of  the lives of those who might walk through the visitation centers(cid:146) doors. It is a first step in  exploring our question.      The Centers    Each of the three Chicago visitation and exchange centers is located within a larger organization  that was founded with a specific cultural identity. They brought this experience to the Safe  Havens demonstration site, although visitation and exchange services have developed largely  along the outlines of the prevailing national model.     Apna Ghar    Apna Ghar (Our Home) (cid:147)was originally founded to meet the expressed need for appropriate  cultural social services for women and children victim of domestic violence who came from the   Chicago Safe Havens Demonstration Site – Accounting for Culture in Supervised Visitation Practices          - 11 -

This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,458 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Spaulding Avenue, from  W. 59th Street to W. 61st Street. The old pipe dates back to 1902, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Thompson’s office, and she has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:           RICHARD J. DALEY        Animal Crackers were introduced to the American public.    Theodore Roosevelt became the first American President to ride in an automobile.    The first college football bowl game, the Rose Bowl between Michigan and Stanford,   was held in Pasadena, California.               JC Penney opened its first store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming.    The Texas Oil Company, Texaco, was formed.    Denmark became the first country to adopt fingerprinting as a way to identify criminals.    Richard J. Daley was born; he served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in   1976.                SPAULDING AVE. WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,458 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Spaulding Avenue, from W. 59th Street to W. 61st Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1902 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by early August 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Spaulding Avenue, outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOANN THOMPSON   773- 434-3399                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in early August 2013.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.   Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  These  screens should be removed prior to flushing.  This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement.  If you have any  questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.         DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

By early August 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,657 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Spaulding  Avenue, from W. 24th Street to W. 26th Street and W. 24th Street, from S. Christina Avenue to   S. Spaulding Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1895, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  12th Ward Office: 773-523-8250  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635        Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.

When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ALDERMAN JAMES BALCER   773-254-6677   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  July 2015. This project is being coordinated with CDOT and their department will complete all  final restoration following water main construction. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

This policy statement for construction projects institutes  a program for small to mid-sized local businesses to be exclusive bidders on certain construction projects.    I.    A.     To qualify for this construction program, a business must be a mid-sized local business enterprise as defined    Eligibility   by the program rules.  In making a determination whether a business meets that definition, the Chief Procurement   Officer will consider, among other factors, whether the business:     Has been in business for at least one (1) year;     Will  perform  the  majority  of  the  work  on  the  construction  project  with  its  own  forces  and/or   subcontractors who are also small or mid-sized local business enterprises;      Is independent, and not an affiliate or subsidiary of any other business;     Has its principal place of business and the majority of its full-time, regular work force located in  the  Six-County  region  identified  in  Section  2-92-670,  as  evidenced  by  location  of  their  employment as reported to federal and state taxing authorities; and     Has  gross  receipts,  averaged  over  the  firm’s  previous  five  fiscal  years,  or  number  of  employees,  per  pay  period  averaged  over  the  past  twelve  months,  that  do  not  exceed  one  and a half times the size standards set forth in 13 C.F.R. Part 121.     B.    Independence  of  a  business  is  determined  solely  by  the  Chief  Procurement  Officer  or  his  or  her  designee.    Indicia  of  independence  include  the  ability  of  the  applicant  to  perform  satisfactorily  in  its  area(s)  of  specialty   without substantial reliance upon finances, resources, bonding, expertise, staff, facilities, or equipment of another   individual  business.    Recognition  of  the  applicant  as  a  separate  and  distinct  entity  by  governmental  taxing   authorities is not dispositive of the applicant’s assertion of independence.  Independence will be evaluated as of   the date the applicant was established through and including the date of application to the MBI.      C.  MBI is race- and gender-neutral.  Any small or mid-sized business that meets the definition of mid-sized local   business  enterprise  is  eligible  to  bid  on  an  MBI  construction  contract.    City-certified  minority-owned  business   enterprises (MBEs) and women-owned business enterprises (WBEs), by definition in Section 2-92-670, must also   be small local business enterprise as defined in the program rules for the Small Business Initiative (SBI) in order   to be certified as an MBE or WBE, and therefore, they will be presumed to also meet the definition of a mid-sized   business enterprise.  The  City also has  an  approved  small business program for federally-funded contracts, the   Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program.  DBEs certified by any member of the Illinois UCP are also   presumed  to  meet  the  definition  of  a  mid-sized  business  enterprise,  but  must  show  they  are  local  in  order  to   participate in the  program.   The  Chief  Procurement  Officer  will  issue  a form  of affidavit  for  non-certified  firms  to   attest that they meet the definition.  The Chief Procurement Officer reserves the right to conduct investigations to   determine the accuracy of the information provided in such affidavits.                             Mayor Rahm Emanuel              City of Chicago                        Mid-sized Business Initiative (MBI) Construction Program      Policy Statement                                      II.   Implementation      A.  The  Department  of Procurement  Services  (DPS)  will  identify  construction  projects  in the  City’s  Buying  Plan,   updated  each  quarter,  that  will  be  offered  exclusively  to  mid-sized  local  business  enterprises  through  this  MBI   construction  program.    The  projects  will  be  sized  appropriately  for  mid-sized  businesses  and  typically  will  be   limited to estimated project construction costs of $10,000,000 or less.      B.  For those bidders who have not already been determined to be mid-sized local business enterprises, the bid   package  for  each  MBI  construction  program  procurement  will  contain  the  affidavit  referred  to  in  Section  1.C.   above to be completed by the bidder.      C.  Businesses that have been determined to be mid-sized local business enterprises will be required to submit   annual  affidavits  confirming  their  continued  compliance with the  eligibility  requirements  of  MBI.  These firms  will   also be subject to an on-going responsibility to inform DPS of any changes in their status in the interim that might   affect their compliance with MBI’s requirements.      D.  The bid package for MBI construction program procurements will  also include reporting forms, which will  be   required to be completed by successful bidders at the conclusion of the contract which will report on job creation   related to the performance of the City contract as well as other work force, bottom line and anecdotal evidence of   the  impact  of  the  MBI  construction  program  on  the  bidder.    Failure  to  complete  and  submit  reports  as  required   may result in a bidder being declared ineligible for further participation in the MBI construction program.

Data Sources   Figure 1 (extent of sea ice) is based on monthly average sea ice extent data provided by the National  Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). NSIDC’s data are derived from satellite imagery collected and  processed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center  (GSFC). NSIDC also provided Figure 2 data (age distribution of sea ice), which are derived from weekly  NASA satellite imagery and processed by the team of Maslanik and Tschudi at the University of  Colorado, Boulder. Data in Figure 3 come from an analysis conducted by NASA. It is an updated version  of an analysis originally published by Markus et al. (2009).   4.  Data Availability   Figure 1. March and September Monthly Average Arctic Sea Ice Extent, 1979–2016    Users can access monthly map images, geographic information system (GIS)-compatible map files, and  gridded daily and monthly satellite data, along with corresponding metadata, at:  http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/archives.html. From this page, users can also download monthly  extent and area data. From this page, select “FTP Directory” under the “Monthly Extent and  Concentration Images” heading, which will lead to a public FTP site  (ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135). To obtain the March or September monthly data  that were used in this indicator, select the “Mar” or “Sep” directory, then choose the “…area.txt” file  with the data.

EPA obtained the data shown in the figure by contacting NSIDC User Services. The  data are processed by Dr. James Maslanik and Dr. Mark Tschudi at the University of Colorado, Boulder,  and provided to NSIDC. Earlier versions of this analysis appeared in Maslanik et al.

Arctic Sea Ice Melt Season, 1979–2015   Figure 3 is based on many of the same satellite datasets as Figures 1 and 2, including the SMMR, SSM/I,  SSMIS, and AMSR. Gridded datasets and summary graphs are publicly available at:  https://neptune.gsfc.nasa.gov/csb/index.php?section=54. The NASA team that conducts the analysis  provided data from the summary graphs to allow the time series to be replicated for EPA’s indicator. In  the future, these summary numbers are expected to be posted on NASA’s website along with the  gridded data and summary graphs.   Methodology   5. Data Collection  This indicator is based on maps of sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean and surrounding waters, which  were developed using brightness temperature imagery in the microwave wavelengths collected by  satellites. Data from October 1978 through June 1987 were collected using the Nimbus-7 SMMR  instrument, and data since July 1987 have been collected using a series of successor SSM/I instruments.  In 2008, the SSMIS replaced the SSM/I as the source for sea ice products. These instruments can identify  the presence of sea ice because sea ice and open water have different passive microwave signatures.  They can also identify the surface temperature and detect whether free water is present on the surface  of the ice or within the snowpack on top of the ice—information that helps to identify the start and end  dates of the melt season.   The satellites that supply data for this indicator orbit the Earth continuously, collecting images that can  be used to generate daily maps of sea ice extent. They are able to map the Earth’s surface with a  resolution of 25 kilometers. The resultant maps have a nominal pixel area of 625 square kilometers.  Because of the curved map projection, however, actual pixel sizes range from 382 to 664 square  kilometers.   The satellites that collect the data cover most of the Arctic region in their orbital paths, but the sensors  cannot collect data from a circular area immediately surrounding the North Pole due to orbit inclination.  From 1978 through June 1987, when coverage was from the SMMR instrument, this “pole hole”  measured 1.19 million square kilometers. From July 1987 through December 2007, when coverage was  from the SSM/I instrument, it measured 0.31 million square kilometers. Since January 2008, using  SSMIS, it has measured 0.029 million square kilometers. For more information about this spatial gap and  how it is corrected in the final data, see Section 6.   To calculate the age of ice (Figure 2), the SSM/I, SSMIS, and SMMR imagery have been supplemented  with three additional data sets:   Technical Documentation: Arctic Sea Ice   3   •  AVHRR satellite data, which come from an optical sensing instrument that can measure sea ice  temperature and heat flux, which in turn can be used to estimate thickness. AVHRR also covers  the “pole hole.”   •  Maps of wind speed and direction at 10 meters above the Earth’s surface, which were compiled   by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Centers for  Environmental Prediction (NCEP).   •  Motion vectors that trace how parcels of sea ice move, based on data collected by the   International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP). Since 1979, the IABP has deployed a network of  14 to 30 in situ buoys in the Arctic Ocean that provide information about movement rates at  six-hour intervals.    While direct estimates of sea ice thickness can be obtained from airborne and satellite systems using  laser and radar altimeters, as well as from submarines using sonar, these data sources cannot provide  sufficiently long and consistent time series to be used as an indicator.   For documentation of passive microwave satellite data collection methods, see the summary and  citations at: http://nsidc.org/data/docs/noaa/g02135_seaice_index. For further information on AVHRR  imagery, see: http://noaasis.noaa.gov/NOAASIS/ml/avhrr.html. For motion tracking methods, see  Maslanik et al. (2011), Fowler et al. (2004), and: http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0116.html.   6.   Indicator Derivation   Figure 1. March and September Monthly Average Arctic Sea Ice Extent, 1979–2016    Satellite data are used to develop daily ice extent and concentration maps using an algorithm developed  by NASA. Data are evaluated within grid cells on the map. Image processing includes quality control  features such as two weather filters based on brightness temperature ratios to screen out false positives  over open water, an ocean mask to eliminate any remaining sea ice in regions where sea ice is not  expected, and a coastal filter to eliminate most false positives associated with mixed land/ocean grid  cells.   From each daily map, analysts calculate the total “extent” and “area” covered by ice. These terms are  defined differently as a result of how they address those portions of the ocean that are partially but not  completely frozen:   •  Extent is the total area covered by all pixels on the map that have at least 15-percent ice   concentration, which means at least 15 percent of the ocean surface within that pixel is frozen  over. The 15-percent concentration cutoff for extent is based on validation studies that showed  that a 15-percent threshold provided the best approximation of the “true” ice edge and the  lowest bias. In practice, most of the area covered by sea ice in the Arctic far exceeds the 15- percent threshold, so using a higher cutoff (e.g., 20 or 30 percent) would yield different totals  but similar overall trends (for example, see Parkinson et al., 1999).    •  Area represents the actual surface area covered by ice. If a pixel’s area were 600 square   kilometers and its ice concentration were 75 percent, then the ice area for that pixel would be  450 square kilometers. At any point in time, total ice area will always be less than total ice  extent.   Technical Documentation: Arctic Sea Ice   4   EPA’s indicator addresses extent (the area within the 15-percent concentration contour) rather than  area (the area-integrated concentration). Both of these measurements are valid ways to look at trends  in sea ice, but in this case, EPA chose to look at the time series for extent because it is more complete  than the time series for area. In addition, the available area data set does not include the “pole hole”  (the area directly above the North Pole that the satellites cannot cover), and the size of this unmapped  region changed as a result of the instrumentation changes in 1987 and 2008, creating a discontinuity in  the area data. In contrast, the extent time series assumes that the entire “pole hole” area is covered  with at least 15 percent ice, which is a reasonable assumption based on other observations of this area.  See https://nsidc.org/data/docs/noaa/g02135_seaice_index/#pole_hole for more information about the  “pole hole” and how NASA’s data address it.   NASA’s processing algorithm includes steps to deal with occasional days with data gaps due to satellite  or sensor outages. These days were removed from the time series and replaced with interpolated values  based on the total extent of ice on the surrounding days.   From daily maps and extent totals, NSIDC calculated monthly average extent in square kilometers. EPA  converted these values to square miles to make the results accessible to a wider audience. By relying on  monthly averages, this indicator smooths out some of the variability inherent in daily measurements.   Figure 1 shows trends in March and September average sea ice extent. September is when Arctic sea ice  typically reaches its annual minimum, after melting during the summer months. By looking at the month  with the smallest extent of sea ice, this indicator focuses attention on the time of year when limiting  conditions would most affect wildlife and human societies in the Arctic region. Six months later, March  is when Arctic sea ice typically reaches its annual maximum, after cold winter months freeze new ice.  Presenting the month with the greatest extent of sea ice highlights the extent to which the Arctic region  recovers melted sea ice.   This indicator does not attempt to estimate values from before the onset of regular satellite mapping in  October 1978 (which makes 1979 the first year with March and September data for this indicator). It  also does not attempt to project data into the future.   For documentation of the NASA Team algorithm used to process the data, see Cavalieri et al. (1984) and:  http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051.html. For more details about NSIDC methods, see the Sea Ice Index  documentation and related citations at: http://nsidc.org/data/docs/noaa/g02135_seaice_index.   Other months of the year were considered for this indicator, but EPA chose to focus on March and  September, which represent the annual maximum and minimum extent of sea ice. September extent is  often used as an indicator. One reason is because as temperatures start to get colder, there may be less  meltwater on the surface than during the previous summer months, thus leading to more reliable  remote sensing of ice extent, as the passive microwave signal is influenced by surface meltwater.  Increased melting during summer months leads to changes in the overall character of the ice (i.e., age  and thickness) and these changes have implications throughout the year. Thus, September conditions  are particularly important for assessing the overall health of Arctic sea ice. Conversely, March is the  month when sea ice experiences its peak extent for the year.   Evidence shows that the extent of Arctic sea ice has declined in all months of the year. Comiso (2012)  examined the seasonal pattern in Arctic sea ice extent for three decadal periods plus the years 2007,  2009, and 2010 and found declines throughout the year. Figure TD-1 shows monthly means based on an   Technical Documentation: Arctic Sea Ice   5   analysis from NSIDC—the source of data for this indicator. It reveals that Arctic sea ice extent has  generally declined over time in all months, with the most pronounced decline in the summer and fall.    Figure TD-1. Arctic Sea Ice Extent for Each Month, 1978/1979–2015/2016   Data source: NSIDC: http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/archives.html. Accessed November 2016.        Figure 2. Age of Arctic Sea Ice at Minimum September Week, 1983–2015   A research team at the University of Colorado at Boulder processes daily sequential SSM/I, SMMR,  AMSR-E, and AVHRR satellite data from NASA, then produces maps using a grid with 12 kilometer (km)- by-12 km cells. The AVHRR data help to fill the “pole hole” and provide information about the  temperature and thickness of the ice. Like Figure 1, this method classifies a pixel as “ice” if at least 15  percent of the ocean surface within the area is frozen over. Using buoy data from the IABP, motion  vectors for the entire region are blended via optimal interpolation and mapped on the gridded field.  NCEP wind data are also incorporated at this stage, with lower weighting during winter and higher  weighting during summer, when surface melt limits the performance of the passive microwave data.  Daily ice extent and motion vectors are averaged on a weekly basis. Once sea ice reaches its annual  minimum extent (typically in early September), the ice is documented as having aged by one year. For  further information on data processing methods, see Maslanik et al. (2011), Maslanik et al. (2007), and  Fowler et al. (2004). Although the most recently published representative study does not utilize AMSR-E  brightness data or NCEP wind data for the calculation of ice motion, the results presented in Figure 2  and the NSIDC website incorporate these additional sources.   Figure 2 shows the extent of ice that falls into several age categories. Whereas Figure 1 extends back to  1979, Figure 2 can show trends only back to 1983 because it is not possible to know how much ice is five   Technical Documentation: Arctic Sea Ice   6   or more years old (the oldest age class shown) until parcels of ice have been tracked for at least five  years. Regular satellite data collection did not begin until October 1978, which makes 1983 the first year  in which September minimum ice can be assigned to the full set of age classes shown in Figure 2.    Like Figure 1, Figure 2 is based on the most recent data available. The December 2015 data update  involved a slight adjustment that NSIDC applied to previous data points to better account for the “pole  hole.”   Figure 3. Arctic Sea Ice Melt Season, 1979–2015   Figure 3 depends on a consistent definition of “start date” and “end date” for the annual Arctic sea ice  melt season. Start date refers to the date on which free water begins to be consistently present within  the snowpack on the surface of the ice (i.e., wet snow). Consistency is important to distinguish this melt  onset date from earlier melt events that might not have persisted. End date refers to the date on which  the surface temperature begins to stay consistently at the freezing point of water, and ice begins to  form in the open ocean. Consistency is important to distinguish the freeze date from early freeze events.  Markus et al. (2009) provides more detail about these definitions and how they relate to definitions  used in other analyses.   NASA conducted the analysis by dividing the Arctic Ocean into a grid and determining each year’s melt- season start and end dates for each individual grid cell. NASA averaged the dates across all grid cells to  derive an average start date and an average end date for the entire Arctic region. Figure 3 shows the  aggregated regionwide averages. For additional detail about these methods, see Markus et al. (2009).    NASA reports start and end dates in terms of Julian days (i.e., the number of days since January 1).  Figure 3 is based on Julian days, but the corresponding non-leap year calendar dates have been added to  the y-axis to provide a more familiar frame of reference. This means that a melt date of May 31 in a leap  year will actually be plotted at the same level as June 1 from a non-leap year, for example, and it will  appear to be plotted at June 1 with respect to the y-axis. Plotting the data this way facilitates consistent  year-to-year comparison.   7.  Quality Assurance and Quality Control   Image processing includes a variety of quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures,  including steps to screen out false positives (i.e., ice is detected where it is not actually present). These  procedures are described in NSIDC’s online documentation at:  http://nsidc.org/data/docs/noaa/g02135_seaice_index as well as in some of the references cited  therein.   NSIDC Arctic sea ice data have three levels of processing for QC. NSIDC’s most recent data come from  the Near Real-Time SSM/I Polar Gridded Sea Ice Concentrations (NRTSI) data set. NRTSI data go through  a first level of calibration and quality control to produce a preliminary data product. The final data are  processed by NASA’s GSFC, which uses a similar process but applies a higher level of QC. Switching from  NRTSI to GSFC data can result in slight changes in the total extent values—on the order of 50,000 square  kilometers or less for total sea ice extent.   GSFC processing requires several months of lag time. At the time EPA published this version of the  indicator, the GSFC data for 2016 had not yet been finalized.   Technical Documentation: Arctic Sea Ice   7   Melt-season data for Figure 3 undergo a set of key QA/QC procedures as described in Markus et al.  (2009). For example, to eliminate spurious data points, the results from each individual grid cell are  compared with results from neighboring cells. Wide discrepancies between neighbors lead to potentially  erroneous data points being excluded from subsequent analysis. NASA also checks results through  comparisons with other similar datasets.   Analysis   8.  Comparability Over Time and Space   All three figures for this indicator are based on data collection methods and processing algorithms that  have been applied consistently over time and space. NASA’s satellites cover the entire area of interest  with the exception of the “pole hole” for Figure 1. Even though the size of this hole has changed over  time, EPA’s indicator uses a data set that corrects for this discontinuity.   The total extent shown in Figure 2 (the sum of all the stacked areas) differs from the total extent shown  for September in Figure 1 because Figure 2 shows conditions during the specific week in September  when minimum extent is reached, while the series in Figure 1 shows average conditions over the entire  month of September. It would not make sense to convert Figure 2 to a monthly average for September  because all ice is “aged” one year as soon as the minimum has been achieved, which creates a  discontinuity after the minimum week.   9.  Data Limitations   Factors that may impact the confidence, application, or conclusions drawn from this indicator are as  follows:   1.  Variations in sea ice are not entirely due to changes in atmospheric or ocean temperature.   Other conditions, such as fluctuations in oceanic and atmospheric circulation and natural annual  and decadal variability, can also affect the extent of sea ice, and by extension the sea ice age  indicator.   2.  Changes in the age and thickness of sea ice—for example, a trend toward younger or thinner   ice—might increase the rate at which ice melts in the summer, making year-to-year  comparisons more complex.   3.  Many factors can diminish the accuracy of satellite mapping of sea ice. Although satellite   instruments and processing algorithms have improved somewhat over time, applying these new  methods to established data sets can lead to trade-offs in terms of reprocessing needs and  compatibility of older data. Hence, this indicator does not use the highest-resolution imagery or  the newest algorithms. Trends are still accurate, but should be taken as a general representation  of trends in sea ice extent, not an exact accounting.   4.  As described in Section 6, the threshold used to determine extent—15-percent ice cover within   a given pixel—represents an arbitrary cutoff without a particular scientific significance.  Nonetheless, studies have found that choosing a different threshold would result in similar  overall trends. Thus, the most important part of Figure 1 is not the absolute extent reported for  any given year, but the size and shape of the trend over time.   Technical Documentation: Arctic Sea Ice   8   water vapor, melt on the ice surface, and changes in the character of the snow and ice surface. The  intensity of Northern Annular Mode (NAM) conditions and changes to the Arctic Oscillation (specific  patterns of variability in atmospheric circulation) also have a strong year-to-year impact on ice  movement. Under certain conditions, older ice might move to warmer areas and be subject to increased  melting. Weather patterns can also affect the sweeping of sea ice out of the Arctic entirely. For a more  complete description of major thermodynamic processes that impact ice longevity, see Maslanik et al.  (2007) and Rigor and Wallace (2004).   According to NSIDC’s documentation at: http://nsidc.org/data/docs/noaa/g02135_seaice_index, extent  is a more reliable variable than ice concentration or area. The weather and surface effects described  above can substantially impact estimates of ice concentration, particularly near the edge of the ice pack.  Extent is a more stable variable because it simply registers the presence of at least a certain percentage  of sea ice in a grid cell (15 percent). For example, if a particular pixel has an ice concentration of 50  percent, outside factors could cause the satellite to measure the concentration very differently, but as  long as the result is still greater than the percent threshold, this pixel will be correctly accounted for in  the total “extent.” Monthly averages also help to reduce some of the day-to-day “noise” inherent in sea  ice measurements.   12.  Statistical/Trend Analysis   The key points associated with Figure 3 report total change in melt dates, freeze dates, and melt season  duration. These changes are all based on ordinary least-squares linear regression slopes for the full  period of record (1979–2015). All three trends are significant to at least a 95-percent confidence level (p  < 0.05). Specific trends are as follows:   •  Start date: -0.295 days/year (p < 0.001)  •  End date: +0.730 days/year (p < 0.001)  •  Duration: +1.025 days/year (p < 0.001)   This indicator does not report on the slope of the apparent trends in sea ice extent and age distribution,  nor does it calculate the statistical significance of these trends. However, several other peer-reviewed  publications (e.g., Cavalieri and Parkinson, 2012; Parkinson, 2014), have performed linear regressions on  these data and reported statistically significant decreases in both monthly sea ice extent and the extent  of multi-year sea ice. NSIDC’s website provides the standard deviation for each trend shown in the  monthly sea ice extent anomaly graphs at: http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index.   References   Cavalieri, D.J., P.
