By mid November 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and NPL Construction Co.  crews will begin the work to install 3,098 feet of new 8-inch water main in W. Diversey Avenue,  from N. Kimball Avenue to N. Sacramento Avenue and N. Christiana Avenue, from W. George Street  to W. Diversey Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1891, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  35th Ward Office: 773-887-3772  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635        Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.   Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    13th Ward Office: 773-581-8000    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.

By mid-May, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 2,592 feet of  new 8-inch water main in E. 61st Street, from S. State Street to S. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.  The old water main dates back to 1896, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    20th Ward Office: 773-955-5610    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

Gaps in  the provision of services and the need for a central source for victim information,  resources, and referral links were identified.   In 1998, the City of Chicago Domestic Violence Help Line began operation. The  intent was to alleviate the frustrating and often tedious search for services by  victims and those who respond to victim’s request for help such as police officers.    •  The Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 mandated the police department to  give a domestic violence referral to the victim in all domestic violence related  calls.  The Help Line gives officers a single phone number to access all domestic  violence services in Chicago. Giving the Help Line number is now mandatory  protocol for police officers.    •  Since its inception, the Help Line is a public-private collaboration between the   City’s Mayor’s Office on Domestic Violence (MODV) and the Chicago  Metropolitan Battered Women’s Network (CMBWN), a private coalition of  domestic violence agencies.    •  The City’s Help Line operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is a toll  free, multi-lingual, confidential service that functions as a clearinghouse for all  domestic violence services in the metropolitan area.    •  Victim Information and Referral Advocates (VIRAs), employed by the CMBWN   answer calls received at the Help Line and provide general domestic violence  information, referral and linkage between victims and domestic violence  community based services and public responders.    •  VIRAs are trained domestic violence advocates who provide information and  options available for the victim to make her own informed decision about her  situation.   •  VIRAs collect basic information from each caller including demographics and   service needs (not victim identifying information). Call information recorded into  a database includes victim and abuser demographic information, presence of  children, referral source, services requested, and the zip code of the caller.    •  Based on the service need the VIRA searches an up to date database containing   domestic violence service provider agency information.  Once a referral is  identified, a direct three way phone link can be made between the Help Line  caller, the VIRA and the community based service to ensure that callers get  connected directly to the program.  If the caller prefers or the agency is closed, the  domestic violence agency’s phone number is offered.     •  MODV analyzes the administrative data for trends and gaps in service and   publishes annual reports including caller demographics and other highlights.

10474`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/ethics/general/AO_OutsideEmployment/99017.q.pdf`Success`Success`4`4`Not a fillable PDF.`"April 7,  1999   CONFIDENTIAL   [John], [Senior Manager]  [Department 1 ]  [  ]  Chicago, IL  [   Re:   Case No. 99017.Q  Outside Employment   Dear [John],   ],   ] in the City's [Department 1   You are [Senior Manager  and  an  attorney licensed to  practice in Illinois.  You are  interested in doing pro  bono legal work outside your City position.  You have discussed this matter  with the [head] of your department, [  and  he  suggested  you contact the  Board of Ethics.  In a letter of March 22,  1999,  you  asked  the Board for written advice on whether the Governmental Ethics Ordinance  would limit or prohibit you from  providing pro bono legal  assistance while  you continue to  work for  the  City.  Based on the  facts  you presented,  staff  concludes  that  the  Ethics  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  you  from  providing  this  pro  bono  legal  assistance  while  remaining  employed  in  your  City  position,  but  it  does  impose  certain  restrictions  of which  you  should  be  aware.  This  letter  summarizes  the  relevant  facts  and  the  restrictions  the  Ordinance imposes.   In your City position, you explained, you supervise [City employees]  in your  department's  [Bureau X],  one of [several bureaus]  in the department.  This  [bureau deals  with  issues  pertinent to]  four  City  departments:  [Department  2],  [Department 3],[Department 4], and [Department 5].  [Projects the bureau   undertakes] concern, for example, [   ]  recycling,  garbage  collection,  food  safety,  and  obstructions  of the   public way.   You indicated that you are  interested in doing pro bono legal  work through  [a free legal assistance program for the elderly  ],   a legal assistance project administered by [a lawyers' association   ] .  This  program  provides  free  legal  advice  and representation-for example, drafting wills, powers of attorney, and real  estate  documents-to  hospice  patients  in  Chicago  area  hospices  and  to  homebound  elderly.  Attorneys  working  through  this  program  volunteer  their time and services, thus you would not be compensated for your work in   the  program.  You  anticipate  that  you would  primarily handle wills  and  real  estate documents  through the   Case No.  99017.Q  April 7,  1999  Page 3   program, and you said you would do so outside your City hours, either on weekends, evenings, or  days  off.  You  do  not  anticipate  appearing  before  City  agencies,  including  your  own,  or  appearing before  any other courts or  administrative  bodies,  on behalf of clients.  You have  not  yet  made  arrangements  to  work  with  this  or  any  other legal  assistance  program;  however,  you  said  you  are  not  currently  interested  in  doing  pro  bono  legal  work  other  than  through  this  program.   Based  on  these  facts  you  presented,  staff concludes  that  the  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  your  proposed pro bono legal work.  However, it does impose certain restrictions on you.   First,  §  2-156-090,  ""Representation  of Other  Persons,""  contains  several  restrictions.  Section  -090(a)  prohibits you,  as  a City employee,  from  representing or having an economic interest1  in  the representation of any person other than the City in any formal  or informal transaction before  your  own  or  any  other  City  agency  where  the  agency's  action  or  non-action  is  non-ministerial  (i.e.,  involves  discretion)  except  in  the  performance  of your  City  employment  duties.  Section  -090(b) prohibits you from having an economic interest in the representation of any person in any  judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding before any administrative agency or court in which the City  is  a party and the person's interest is  adverse to  the  City's.  The  Board has  construed the terms  ""represent""  and  ""representation"" to  apply to  a broad range  of activities  in which one person acts  as  a spokesperson for  another,  including making personal appearances before,  telephone contact  with, or submitting written documents to any City personnel or agencies.   Second,  as  a  City  employee,  you  owe  your  primary  loyalty  to  the  City,  under  §  2-156-020,  ""Fiduciary  Duty.""  This  section  obligates  you  to  use  your  City position  responsibly  and  in  the  best interests of the public, and to  exercise your professional judgments and City responsibilities  It also  prohibits  you  from  using your  free  from  conflicting duties  to  outside entities or clients.  City position to  obtain private  benefits,  such as  to  promote  the  interests  of your  clients.  (See  Case No.  9706l.A.)   In  addition,  § 2-156-070,  ""Use  or Disclosure  of Confidential  Information,""  prohibits  you  from  using  or revealing,  other  than  in  the  performance  of your  City  duties,  confidential  information  you  have  acquired  through  your  City  employment.  Confidential  information,  for  purposes  of  this section, means any information that may not be obtained pursuant to  the Illinois Freedom of  Information Act, as amended.  Further,§ 2-156-060,  ""City-Owned Property,"" prohibits you from  using any City property or resources in your non-City position, or for any private benefit, without  authorization.   1 An  economic  interest,  as  defmed  in  §  2-156-0lO(i),  is  any  interest  valued  or  capable  of valuation  in  monetary  terms.  ""An  economic  interest  in  the  representation""  thus  includes,  for  example,  compensation  in  any  manner by the client.  Case No.  90035.A.   Case No.  99017.Q  April 7,  1999  Page4   ] .   If   Finally,  you  indicated  that  you  would  not  be  paid  for  your  legal  work  through  the  [free  legal  assistance program  this  changes,  and  you  are  offered  compensation  for  your  work  for  this  program,  please  advise  us,  as  additional  Ordinance  provisions would apply.  Staffs opinion is  not necessarily dispositive  of all  issues relevant to  this  situation,  but is  based  solely on the  application of the City's Governmental Ethics  Ordinance to  the facts  stated in this  opinion.  If the  facts  stated  are  incorrect  or  incomplete,  or  if the  nature  of your  outside  legal  work changes  so  that the  statements made  about it in  this  letter are  rio  longer applicable,  please  notify  us  immediately,  as  any  change  may  alter  our  opinion.  Also,  you  should  be  aware  that  other laws  or rules,  such as  Personnel  Rules  XVIII, Section  1,  no.  43,  and  XX,  Section 3,  may  impose additional restrictions on your outside legal work, and we advise you to  seek guidance to  be  sure  you  are  in  compliance  with  them.  Finally,  be  advised  that  City  departments  have  the  authority to  adopt and enforce rules of conduct that may be more restrictive than the  limitations  imposed by the Ethics Ordinance.   Very truly yours,   Steven I. Berlin  Deputy Director   Approved by:   Dorothy J.  Eng  Executive Director   ejk/990 17-redact.wpd   "
