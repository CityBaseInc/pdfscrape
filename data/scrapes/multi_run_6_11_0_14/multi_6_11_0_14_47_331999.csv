LaSalle St., Room []  Chicago, IL 60602    RE:    Dear Mr. [Dee]:    You  are  a  [professional]  with  the  City’s  [Department],  [Division].  On  June  27,  2008,  you  asked  for  an  advisory  opinion  addressing  whether  a  proposed  conveyance of land from the City’s Department of Housing to a City employee is  prohibited by the Governmental Ethics Ordinance. More specifically, you asked  for an opinion as to whether, based on the facts set forth below, the conveyance  falls  within  the  “unless  sold  pursuant  to  a  process  of  competitive  bidding  following  public  notice...”  exclusion  in  Municipal  Code  §  2-156-110.    As  explained in this opinion, the Board has determined that:  1) the land was sold  pursuant to a process of competitive bidding following public notice; and thus 2)  the conveyance will not result in this City employee having a prohibited financial  interest under the Ordinance.    FACTS:      The  Property:    The  City  property  located  at  13[xxx]  S.  Avenue  ""[letter]""  (the  ""Property"")  was  posted  for  30  days  on  the  City’s  Department  of  Housing’s  (“DOH”) website for homes available for purchase. The purchase price, $5,000,  was established by the DOH. The Property was being offered for sale pursuant  to the City's Preserving Communities Together (PCT) Program.1                                                                11.    The  PCT  program  is  authorized  by  §11-31-1(d)  of  the  Illinois  Municipal  Code,  24  ILCS  5/11-31-1(d).    It  replaced  the  Chicago  Abandoned  Properties  Program  (“CAP”)which  was  adopted  by  Ordinance  May  20,  1992, and published in the Journal of Proceedings of the City Council (“Journal of Proceedings”) for such date  at pages 16322-16335.    Case No. 08038.A  August 27, 2008  Page 2    The  Preserving  Communities  Together  Program:      In  general  terms,  the  PCT  Program  involves  the  City's  conveyance  of  abandoned  buildings  (typically,  3  units or less) to developers for rehabilitation.   According to [Art Smith], Deputy  Commissioner  of  [Department],  whom  you  authorized  Board  staff  to  contact,  DOH  reviews  all  applications  based  on  the  applicants’  previous  experience,  financial  capacity,  scope  of  work  for  the  project,  development  budget,  and  proposed end use.  Mr. [Smith] stated that after rehabilitation, the property may  be occupied by, leased by, or resold by the developer.  The weight given to each  factor depends on the type of project (light or extensive rehab/ owner-occupant  or developer).  The condition of the building and the level of rehabilitation that  it  needs  is  considered  in  reviewing  the  scope  of  work  submitted  by  each  applicant,  and,  with  more  difficult  rehabilitation  projects,  the  DOH  will  give  greater  weight  to  applicants  with  more  experience.    For  owner-occupant  projects, according to Mr. [Smith], being a resident of the community where  the  property is located is given greater weight (assuming the required rehabilitation  is  not  too  extensive).    Mr.  [Smith]  indicated  that  one  of  the  most  important  factors  in  all  cases  is  the  financing  that  the  applicant  has--lines  of  credit,  construction financing, construction escrow, etc.  The DOH has to make sure the  applicant  has  a  commitment  for  the  amount  that  will  be  needed  to  cover  the  project.      As provided by the PCT Ordinance, DOH administers the PCT Program.  After the  applicants  have  had  an  opportunity  to  walk  through  the  property  to  gather  information for the scope of work and construction budget, a deadline is set for  those items to be submitted to DOH.  All completed applications are reviewed  by  the  Program  Assistant,  the  Program  Coordinator,  the  Program  Building  Inspector, and the Program Deputy.  Recommendations are made to the Deputy  Commissioner,  who  has  the  final  say  of  which  applicant  the  Department  will  select to develop the property under the Program.    Mr. [Smith] indicated that properties are posted for a minimum of 30 days or  until the DOH has at least 2 applicants, whichever takes longer.  He said that it  is usually a minimum of 45 days, because once the DOH gets 3 applicants, it  sets a deadline for applications, which is usually 14-30 days from the point that  DOH receives the third completed application.2                                                              22.  Mr. [Smith] provided the following example as a typical time table:   Case No. 08038.A  August 27, 2008  Page 3    The Conveyance: The City conveyed the Property to [Rick Ross], a City employee.   Mr. [Ross] and another applicant (name not provided, but also a City employee)  each  submitted  to  DOH  an  application  to  purchase  and  rehabilitate  the  single  family home on the Property in accordance with provisions of the PCT Program.   After evaluating each applicant's proposed use, budget, qualifications and scope  of work, as described above,DOH selected Mr. [Ross] as the developer to whom  the Property should be conveyed.  DOH's selection was not based on purchase  price,  because  that  amount  had  already  been  set  by  DOH.    According  to  Mr.  [Smith],  DOH  chose  Mr.  [Ross]  because  the  other  applicant’s  and  his  wife’s  combined income exceeded 80% of the median income of the area in which the  property  is  located  (this  is  the  criterion  DOH  refers  to  as  “affordability  ”).   Although  the  program  ordinance  does  not  itself  impose  any  affordability  requirements as to the resale, rental or occupancy of the rehabilitated home, the  proposed redevelopment agreement between the City and Mr. [Ross] will require  him to sell the Property to a purchaser with a total household income of less  than  80%  of  Area  Median  Income  unless  otherwise  authorized  by  the  Commissioner of the DOH.   Given the market in which the home is located, this  will result in a sale at what is effectively the market value.  DOH recommended  that City Council authorize the conveyance of the Property to Mr. [Ross].    On June 11, 2008, City Council passed the ordinance (the ""June 11 Ordinance""),  which authorizes the City to convey the Property to Mr. [Ross] pursuant to the  PCT Program.  The purchase price set forth in the June 11 Ordinance is $5,000.    Mr. [Ross] will not live (either as owner or tenant) in the home on the Property,  but will rehabilitate the home and then sell or lease it.    You informed Board staff that, in the [Department]’s judgment, the conveyance  did not fall within the  “Eligible Persons” and “Eligible Programs"" exclusion in §  2-156-110.                                                                                                                                                                                Day 1:  DOH  learns  that  it  will  most  likely  be  acquiring  a  building  and  it  posts  it  on  the  website  and  begins  taking   Day 45:  DOH acquires the property.  In the file DOH has 5 completed applications.  DOH posts on its website a deadline   applications.   “14 days out” to submit applications.   Day 59:  Deadline to have all completed applications for the property.  Those with complete applications are given the  day and time of the open house where DOH will allow them to walk through with contractors to develop scope of work and development  budgets.   applications to review.   Day 69:  Open house is held for those applicants who made it in before the deadline.  Day 79:  Scopes of work with costs and development budgets are due.  Staff involved with selection process is given  Day 83: Review meeting is held and an applicant is selected.   Case No. 08038.A  August 27, 2008  Page 4    LAW AND ANALYSIS:     To advise you, we will consider the facts you have presented in accordance with  § 2-156-110 of the Ordinance, “Interest in City Business.”  It states, in relevant  part:     Except  with  respect  to  the  participation  of  Eligible  Persons  in  Eligible  Programs, no elected official or employee shall have in his own name or  in the name of any other person in any contract, work or business with  the  City,  or  in  the  sale  of  any  article,  whenever  the  expense,  price  or  consideration of the contract, work, business or sale is paid with funds  belonging  to  or  administered  by  the  City,  or  is  authorized  by  ordinance....Unless  sold  pursuant  to  a  process  of  competitive  bidding  following  public  notice,  no  elected  official  or  employee  shall  have  a  financial interest in the purchase of any property that (i) belongs to the  City, or (ii) is sold for taxes or assessments, or (iii) is sold by virtue of  legal process at the suit of the City....As used in this section, the terms  “Eligible Persons” and “Eligible Programs” have the meanings provided in  section  2-44-100  [sic]  and  shall  be  determined  by  the  department  of  housing.     The  Board  accepts  your  Department’s  judgment  that  the  facts  presented  indicated  that  the  conveyance  did  not  fall  within  the  ""participation  of  Eligible  Persons  in  Eligible  Programs""  exclusion  in  §  2-156-110.    Our  analysis  here  focuses on whether there was a process of competitive bidding following public  notice.      The facts presented indicate that the Property was posted for sale on the City’s  website for 30 days.  More than one applicant applied through the website.  Mr.  [Smith]  indicated  that  after  evaluating  each  applicant’s  proposed  use,  budget,  qualifications  and  scope  of  work,  DOH  selected  Mr.  [Ross]  the  Property’s  developer.  DOH chose Mr. [Ross] because the other applicant’s and his wife’s  combined incomes exceeded 80% of the median income of the area in which the  property is located (“affordability ”).      Case No. 08038.A  August 27, 2008  Page 5  Under  Board  case  law,  a  City  employee  is  prohibited  from  having  a  “financial  interest” in the purchase of City property unless it is sold through “a process of  competitive  bidding  following  public  notice.”  Competitive  bidding  refers  to  a  process in which all parties submitting bids are treated equally and are bidding  on the same terms and conditions.  See Case Nos. 93034.A, 00010.A, 06079.A.  The requirement for public notice under the Interest in City business provision  was also followed in this case.  Mr. [Smith] indicated that properties are posted  for a minimum of 30 days or until the DOH has at least 2 applicants, whichever  takes longer.  He said that it is usually a minimum of 45 days, because once the  DOH gets 3 applicants, it sets a deadline for applications, which is usually 14- 30 days from the point that DOH receives the third completed application.   The  property  was  on  the  DOH  website  for  30  days.    After  the  City  had  the  two  applicants  and  reviewed  each  applicant’s  proposed  use,  budget,  qualifications  ans  scope  of  work  ,  DOH  selected  Mr.  [Ross]  as  the  developer  to  whom  the  Property  should  be  conveyed.  In  a  prior  Board  case,  93034.A,  once  the  City  accepted  the  proposals  submitted  by  the  two  parties,  the  Commission,  as  required  by  Ordinance,  declared  its  intention,  at  public  meetings  and  by  resolutions,  to  enter  into  negotiations  with  the  specified  developers.    It  then  published these resolutions in the Sun-Times once a week for two consecutive  weeks.    Each  notice  expressly  gave  any  other  party  interested  in  those  properties 30 days to submit a proposal.3     The facts here fit well within the  parameters established by the Board as constituting a process of public notice  followed by competitive bidding.  The City employees submitted bids and were  evaluated  according  to  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  would  have  been  applied  to  any  other  potential  bidder  in  relation  to  this  property.    Thus,  the  Board  concludes  that  there  was  a  process  of  competitive  bidding  following  public notice.      DETERMINATIONS: Based on the facts presented, the Board determines that: 1)  the  Property  was  sold  pursuant  to  a  process  of  competitive  bidding  following  public notice; and thus 2) the conveyance the Property addressed in this opinion                                                                3 The CDC also was required to mail copies of the resolutions to, and to invite proposals from, all parties who,  within the last year, had advised the Commission or the Department in writing of their interest in any parcel in  those redevelopment areas.  These parties also were given 30 days to submit a proposal.  No other bidders  responded to the public notice on either property.   Case No. 08038.A  August 27, 2008  Page 6  will  not  result  Mr.  [Ross]  having  a  prohibited  financial  interest  under  the  Ordinance.4    Our determinations do not necessarily dispose of all the issues relevant to your  situation,  but  are  based  solely  on  the  application  of  the  City’s  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts presented are  incomplete or incorrect, please notify us immediately, as any change may alter  our opinion.  Other rules or laws may also apply to your situation. We also note  that  any  City  department  may  adopt  restrictions  that  are  more  stringent  than  those imposed by the Governmental Ethics Ordinance.    RELIANCE: This opinion may only be relied upon by any person involved in the  specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered.      ___________________________________  Miguel A. Ruiz, Chair                                                                  43.  The Board notes that, at the request of the Commissioner of Housing and the Law Department, an amendment to the  PCT  ordinance  was  presented  to  the  City  Council  at  its  July  30,  2008,  which  will  make  the  PCT  program  an  “Eligible  Program” under § 2-156-110, and specifically allow City employees to participate in this  program.  This opinion, however,  obviously addresses a conveyance made before that ordinance would become effective.      "

By	early	October	2016,	Department	of	Water	Management	(DWM)	and	NPL	Construction	Company	 crews	will	begin	the	work	to	install	538	feet	of	new	8‐inch	and	3,662	feet	of	new	12‐inch	water	 main	in	N.	Kedzie	Avenue,	from	N.	Avondale	Avenue	to	N.	Milwaukee	Avenue	and	N.	Emmett	Street,	 from	N.	Sawyer	Avenue	to	N.	Kedzie	Avenue.	The	old	water	main	dates	back	to	1891,	and	needs	to	 be	replaced.		 	If	you	would	like	to	receive	regular	email	updates	about	the	progress	of	the	project,	please	go	to	 BuildingANewChicago.org	to	register	for	the	WaterALERT	program.		Simply	enter	your	name,	 email	address	and	the	project	identification	number	at	the	top	of	this	letter.	 	By	signing	up	for	the	WaterALERT	emails,	you	will	be	notified	as	the	project	enters	each	new	 construction	phase	–	from	our	mobilization	of	equipment	onto	the	site,	to	the	installation	of	new	 pipes,	to	the	final	restoration	of	the	street.	 	When	we	are	working	in	the	street,	we	may	close	or	limit	it	to	traffic	for	safety	reasons,	but	you	will	 always	be	able	to	reach	your	home	or	business.		Outside	of	working	hours,	a	travel	lane	will	be	left	 open	for	local	traffic	only.		 	We	will	post	our	work	area	for	“No	Parking”	as	needed	during	work	hours	(generally	7am‐4pm).		 Parking	outside	of	those	hours	will	be	allowed,	but	cars	will	need	to	be	moved	by	the	start	of	the	 next	workday.		We	will	try	to	preserve	as	much	parking	space	as	possible.	 	We	know	that	construction	always	involves	inconveniences	and	noise.	We	will	do	everything	 possible	to	maintain	your	quality	of	life	throughout	these	projects,	and	conducting	ourselves	as	 good	and	thoughtful	neighbors	in	the	course	of	our	presence	on	your	street.		 	Should	you	have	any	questions	or	concerns,	you	can	either	ask	the	construction	foreman	during	the	 project,	or	call	any	of	the	following	numbers:	 	   24‐Hour	City	Service	and	Information	Line:		311	   33rd	Ward	Office:	773‐478‐8040	   DWM	Office	of	Public	Affairs:		312‐744‐6635	     Genwmnot03032016   	 Flushing	after	Your	Service	Line	has	been	Connected	to	the	New	Water	Main		  	When	we	switch	over	the	services	from	the	old	main	to	the	new	water	main,	we	will	interrupt	water	 service.		We	give	you	24‐hour	notice	when	this	is	to	happen.		However,	in	the	event	of	an	emergency	 shutdown	during	construction,	we	may	not	be	able	to	give	you	prior	warning.	 	Now	that	your	old	water	main	has	been	replaced	and	your	water	service	has	been	connected	to	the	 new	water	main,	it	is	important	to	flush	your	plumbing	of	any	sediment,	rust	or	metals,	including	 any	lead	to	maintain	water	quality.			 	Sediment,	rust	and	metals,	including	any	lead	may	collect	in	the	aerator	screen	located	at	the	tip	of	 your	faucets.		These	screens	should	be	removed	prior	to	flushing.	 (1)	Please	find	the	closest	available	tap	(an	outside	 hose	spigot,	laundry	sink	faucet	or	bathtub)	to	where	 the	water	comes	into	the	home	that	is	not	used	for	 drinking	water.	Fully	open	the	cold	water	tap	and	let	 the	water	run	for	at	least	5	minutes.		Next	flush	any	 other	cold	water	faucets	on	that	floor	for	at	least	5	 minutes.		 (2)Move	to	the	next	highest	floor	and	repeat.	 (3)	Move	to	additional	floors	in	sequence	and	flush									 any	taps	or	faucets	for	at	least	5	minutes.		 			If	you	have	any	questions	or	concerns	about	your	water	quality,	or	if	you	would	like	your	water	 tested,	please	call	us	at	311.		For	additional	advice	and	information	visit	 http://www.epa.gov/il/advice‐chicago‐residents‐about‐lead‐drinking‐water.	 	 If	your	water	line	has	been	idle	or	stagnant	for	more	than	6‐hours,	it	is	advised	that	you	flush	for	at	 least	5	minutes	to	maintain	water	quality.		This	may	include	flushing	the	toilet,	taking	a	shower	and	 doing	laundry.			 	 Lastly,	if	you	don’t	already	have	one,	I	ask	you	to	consider	the	installation	of	a	water	meter	in	your	 home	to	help	you	save	money	on	your	water	bill.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,677 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Rockwell Street, from W.  Marquette Road to W. Lithuanian Plaza Court, and in W. Lithuanian Plaza Court, from S.  Rockwell Street to S. Western Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1913, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Lane’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                  ROSA PARKS                Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States.    Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in Sheffield, England.    The Ford Motor company introduced the first moving assembly line.    The first prize was inserted into a Cracker Jack box.    Gideon Sundback patented the zipper.    The Panama Canal opened.    Civil rights activist Rosa Parks was born in Tuskegee, Alabama.                               ROCKWELL/LITHUANIAN WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,677 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Rockwell Street, from W. Marquette Road to W. Lithuanian Plaza Court, and in  W. Lithuanian Plaza Court, from S. Rockwell Street to S. Western Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1913 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late July 2013. Restoration will follow in late August 2013. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN LONA LANE   773-471-1991      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July 2013.  Restoration will be completed in late August 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

In early March, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 937 feet of  new 8-inch water main in E. 93rd Street (Lyon-Cottage Grove). The old water main dates back to  1894, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    9th Ward Office: 773-785-1100    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

Belmont  Avenue, from N. Sayre Avenue to N. Nottingham Avenue.       Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1914 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by W.  Henderson Avenue on the north, W. Wellington Avenue on the south, N. Sayre Avenue on the  east, and N. Neva Avenue on the west benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of  flooding.      Timing:  Work by the contractor at Belmont/Sayre will commence in late February, with  completion anticipated for mid-March. Installation of the new sewer in Belmont, from Sayre to  Nottingham will follow, and we expect the work to be completed by mid-June. Restoration of  the damaged streets/parkways will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other  factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working  hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1            ALDERMAN NICHOLAS SPOSATO   773-836-0036            ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it  is.  Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of  digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will  pave the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and  curb at least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City  of Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce  the risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are  aware that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Sposato  and others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.

This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,053 feet of 8-inch water main in E. 65th Street, from S.  Vernon Avenue to S. St. Lawrence Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1902, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Cochran’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:           RICHARD J. DALEY               Animal Crackers were introduced to the American public.    Theodore Roosevelt became the first American President to ride in an automobile.    The first college football bowl game, the Rose Bowl between Michigan and Stanford,   was held in Pasadena, California.     JC Penney opened its first store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming.    The Texas Oil Company, Texaco, was formed.    Denmark became the first country to adopt fingerprinting as a way to identify criminals.    Richard J. Daley was born; he served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in   1976.                                                    65TH ST. WATER PROJECT  PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,053 feet of 8-inch  water main in E. 65th Street, from S. Vernon Avenue to S. St. Lawrence Avenue.     Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1902 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by mid September 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on E. 65th Street outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN WILLIE COCHRAN   773-955-5610   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                     FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid September  2013. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.   Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  These  screens should be removed prior to flushing.  This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement.  If you have any  questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.         DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:     A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.      Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,271 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Springfield Avenue, from  W. Wellington Avenue to W. Diversey Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1898, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Suarez’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Ray Suarez             31st Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            Do you wonder what was happening in 1898?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:           DOROTHY GISH                 The first auto insurance policy was issued in the United States.    Will Kellogg invented Corn Flakes.    The first amusement pier opened in Atlantic City, New Jersey.    The loudspeaker was invented.    The City of New York was established.    Scientists Pierre and Marie Curie discovered radium.    American actress Dorothy Gish was born.                                          WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,271 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Springfield Avenue, from W. Wellington Avenue to W. Diversey Avenue.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1898 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in April.  Restoration will follow in late May. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN RAY SUAREZ   773-486-6488      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                                 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in April. Restoration  will be completed in late May. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!
