That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                      CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                     W. ROOSEVELT RD. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 8,346 feet of 12-inch  water main in W. Roosevelt Road, from S. Kolmar Avenue to S. Homan Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in early September 2014. This project is being coordinated with IDOT and their  department will complete all final restoration following water main construction. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Roosevelt Road outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      ALDERMAN MICHAEL D. CHANDLER   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   3-1-1   773-533-2400   312-742-1029                                                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in early  September 2014. This project is being coordinated with IDOT and their department will  complete all final restoration following water main construction. We always hesitate to promise  specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere  in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

By late March, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 2,576 feet of  new 8-inch water main in N. Hamilton Avenue (Morse-Farwell), in N. Oakley Avenue (Lunt-Morse),  in N. Seeley Avenue (Lunt-Morse), and in W. Farwell Avenue (Bell-Ridge). The old water main  dates back to 1905, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    50th Ward Office: 773-262-1050    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

Sincerely,    Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.

By late April 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 65 feet of new 8-inch and 5,118 feet of new 16-inch  water main in W. Harrison Street, from S. Ashland Avenue to S. Morgan Street and S. Morgan Street,  from W. Harrison Street to W. Congress Parkway.  The old water main dates back to 1878, and  needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  11th Ward Office:773-254-6677  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 378 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Wolcott Avenue, from W.  Lunt Avenue to W. Morse Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1907, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Moore’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Joseph Moore                    49th Ward    1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         Do you wonder what was happening in 1907? That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                                 For the first time, a ball dropped in Times Square in New York to signal the New Year.    President Theodore Roosevelt shook a record 8,513 hands in one day.    The first cabs with taxi meters began operating in London.    Finland became the first European country to give women the right to vote.    The automatic washer and dryer were introduced.    Oklahoma became the 46th State.    Actor John Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa.                                WOLCOTT AVE. WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 378 feet of 8-inch water  main in N. Wolcott Avenue, from W. Lunt Avenue to W. Morse Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1907 and needs to be replaced.    Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in early December 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2014. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Wolcott Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOSEPH MOORE   773-338-5796                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in early  December 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2014. We always hesitate to promise  specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere  in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Schenkel   to the Committee on the Budget and Government Operations   October 22, 2014       Good morning, Chairman Austin and members of the City Council.     I am honored to sit before you today to discuss the 2015  budget request for the Office of Emergency  Management and Communications (OEMC).     In the coming year, OEMC must continue to strengthen our existing capabilities while also exploring  new, effective and efficient strategies to maximize the Department’s full potential.     OEMC oversees a number of core functions that support public safety, public works and other citywide  operations.  OEMC operates the 9-1-1 Call Center, 3-1-1 City Services, the City’s Office of Emergency  Management, the Traffic Management Authority, and the City’s Public Safety Information Technology  section.      Whether it's the various parades that take place throughout the year, or premier events, such as the  Chicago Marathon, Lollapalooza or the Taste of Chicago, OEMC is the City of Chicago’s lead coordinating  agency during emergency situations and major events.     OEMC works with a variety of partners on a daily basis.  Those partners include City departments, sister  agencies, hospitals, schools, facilities, and the private sector, among many others.  These critically  important partnerships help develop plans for severe weather sheltering, medical emergency surges,  and other preparedness measures that can impact the outcome of a planned or unplanned event.     OEMC employs call-takers, dispatchers, traffic aides, emergency responders, and technology staff, who  provide assistance to residents 24 hours a day, 365  days a year.     One of our most important components in supporting citywide events and emergency management is  the Operations Center.  The Operations Center serves as the nerve center for activities across the City.   The Operations Center monitors public safety responses 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It  coordinates critical information and City resources as an incident develops and it continues to monitor  the City response throughout its duration.  Combined with the City Incident Center, which supports  public works like the Departments of Water Management and Streets and Sanitation, OEMC provides  situational awareness to key stakeholders and ensures that the appropriate resources are mobilized.   The use of the Operations Center ultimately leads to a more effective citywide emergency response,  ensuring resources are used efficiently.    A great example of the Operations Center supporting City response occurred on November 17th, 2013.    As severe weather passed through the City, OEMC’s Operations Center served as a hub of information  sharing between a variety of entities.  This coordination ensured the successful shelter-in-place for the  Chicago Bears game at Soldier Field.  The Operations Center also played a key role in coordinating City  services for other emergent circumstances, like the closing of the Taste of Chicago due to heavy rains  that caused unsafe conditions and standing water on the festival grounds.  This operating model  continues to be cost effective,  since the Emergency Operations Center is opened much less frequently,  resulting in staffing savings citywide.      In 2015, OEMC will continue to explore ways to maximize efficiencies and decrease the number of true  “emergencies” that drain resources. This strategy also provides for targeted redundancy to keep City  services functioning in the midst of disruptive events.    With regard to 9-1-1 Operations, OEMC operates a world-class voice and data radio system, providing  police and fire personnel on the street with valuable information to help them respond quickly to  emergency situations.     On any given day, our 9-1-1 call takers and dispatchers process 15,000 calls for service and over 5 million  calls each year.  OEMC continues to capitalize on advances in technology that can assist our staff in  becoming more efficient and effective in the services they provide.     One of the Department’s key priorities in 2014 was the upgrade of the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD)  system.  This year, the functionality of the CAD system was greatly improved through projects that  streamlined functionality, strengthened security against cyber threats, and improved the process by  which cell phone pictures can be sent to 9-1-1.     OEMC is also home to 3-1-1 City Services.  In 2015, 3-1-1 City Services will continue providing the most  efficient delivery of services possible.     While the preferred method by residents remains requesting services by telephone, residents now have  the option to use Open311, a platform that allows the public to track the status of their City service  request from the point of entry to completion – like tracking a FedEx package.    As in years past, the OEMC will continue to take the lead in the integration of City services.     While most often supporting the Chicago Fire and Chicago Police Departments, OEMC also partners with  the Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) to better integrate technology and operational  procedures.  This integration supports critically important public works services offered through Streets  and Sanitation, Department of Family and Support Services, Chicago Department of Public Health, along  with all other departments that use the 3-1-1 system.     OEMC also oversees the City’s Traffic Management Authority (TMA).  TMA provides traffic management  and traffic control functions throughout the city. Under TMA, the City has been able to implement a  more strategic approach to better coordinate traffic- related enforcement activities for permitted events  throughout the city.     Last year, Traffic Control Aides covered 5,300 roll calls for round-the-clock coverage for special events or  full-time Department of Aviation assignments.     In 2015, TMA will continue to work closely with the Chicago Police Department on an on-going  operational basis, to ensure the public safety and quality of life for residents.      In 2014, OEMC's Public Safety Information Technology Section, otherwise known by the acronym PSIT,  carried out numerous system and equipment upgrades, benefitting departments throughout the City  with the shared goal of ensuring public safety.     These projects include the completed redesign of CPD's Crime Prevention and Information Center (CPIC)  to increase its capabilities; the redesign of Caboodle, the Police Department’s application to graphically  depict data on maps; and updating the computer hardware for all 22  police districts.    In addition, OEMC created the Bad Address Database system allowing users to search location, owner,  building violations, permit applications, and 911 calls for service. The system is now used to determine  the deployment of resources and enhances information sharing between agencies citywide.    Looking ahead, OEMC’s PSIT Section will continue its work to implement a robust technology life cycle  composed of procurement, maintenance and replacement. OEMC will also work to maximize fixed  assets, including camera, radio, and fiber optic systems, to provide both City services and private sector  partners with timely, relevant information necessary for executing their respective functions.     Over the past three years, OEMC has worked to strengthen partnerships between local, state and  federal government.  OEMC works regularly with partners in Cook County to coordinate development  and implementation of federal homeland security grant program projects.     These enhanced partnerships lead to the submission of several joint applications for federal homeland  security grant programs. This integrated effort drives greater unity of effort not only in organizational  partnership, but also in identifying particularly advantageous and timely opportunities.     In 2015, OEMC will continue to work with Cook County and the State of Illinois to enhance the safety  and security of residents in Chicago and Cook County.  Seamless integration among local, regional, state,  and federal partners is vital to OEMC’s responsibility of protecting lives and property in the City of  Chicago.     In the coming year, OEMC will also build upon its partnerships with law enforcement, City departments,  and the private sector, including the Public-Private Task Force, to advance critical public safety initiatives  that will strengthen our overall ability to prevent and deter catastrophic incidents throughout the area.    OEMC must continue its efforts to be prepared for, and respond to, planned and unplanned events.  We  will do this by unifying and utilizing every available resource to enhance the safety and security of the  city.    Thank you, Madam Chairman and members of the City Council. I look forward to answering any  questions.   OEMC   2015 Budget Hearing   MBE/WBE Contracting Data  Period:  01/01/2014 to 09/01/2014  Total Purchases: $35,122,530     MBE/WBE Spend      WBE:   $2,181,331 (6%)   Asian MBE:   $3,844,123 (11%)   African-American MBE:   $1,456,146 (4.5%)   Hispanic MBE:   $3,614,013 (10.5%)   Total Purchases:   $11,095,612 (32%)     Staffing Data        Asian   Black   Hispanic  Native   White   Total         Asian  Black   Hispanic  Native  White  Total   Department Ethnicity and Gender   Male   Female   Total   5   175   52  10   180   422   5   479   68  2   176   730   36.63%   63.37%   10   654   120  12   356   1,152      Department Managers Ethnicity and Gender   Male   Female   Total   0  9  6  0  32  47   0  15  6  0  12  33   0  24  12  0  44  80      New Hires Ethnicity and Gender   Male   Female   Total   %      Asian  Black   Hispanic  Native  White  Total   1  22  3  0  13  39   0  46  3  0  8  57      40.63%   59.38%   1  68  6  0  21  96      1.04%  70.83%  6.25%   0%   21.88%  100%      %   .87%   56.77%   10.42%  1.04%   30.9%   100%      %  0%  30%  15%  0%  55%  100%                            58.75%   41.25%     Interns     School   Northern Illinois University  University of Illinois at Chicago  University of Illinois  Chicago State University  Roosevelt University      Gender  African American  African American  White  African American  Native   Ethnic Origin   Male  Female  Male  Female  Male   The Office of Emergency Management and   Communications   Executive   Office   Public Safety  Information  Technology   Radio   Operations   Administration    & Logistics   9-1-1 Dispatch  Operations    Facilities /  Logistics   IT   Infrastructure   3-1-1 City  Services   Grants / Project  Management   Computer Aided   Dispatch    (CAD)   Traffic   Management   Authority   Application  Development   Emergency  Management   Finance /  Payroll   Labor & Legal   Affairs
