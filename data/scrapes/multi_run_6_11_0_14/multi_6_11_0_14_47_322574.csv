Daley, Mayor  What is the risk?         February 5, 2010   Chicago Department of Public Health  Bechara Choucair, MD, Commissioner   As of February 5, 2010, the risk of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) influenza infection in Chicago is low. The num- bers of severe influenza infections, influenza-like illnesses, and positive influenza tests remain minimal.  Due to the  possibility of a recurrence of heightened activity in the coming months, all Chicagoans aged six months and older  are encouraged to protect themselves from infection by getting vaccinated with the pandemic influenza vaccine.  Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  Dates and locations of  City of Chicago pandemic vaccine clinics  are available by calling 311.      Are severe cases of influenza occurring?    Figure 1. Reported number of hospitalizations associated with  confirmed or presumptive pandemic influenza A (H1N1), Chicago,  by week of specimen collection, April 2009—January 30, 2010      One influenza A (H1N1)-associated hospitalization  in a Chicago resident has been reported for surveil- lance week 4 (January 24 –  30, 2010). This is a  99% decrease from the highest reported in early  November (figure 1).            How much influenza-like illness is occurring?       With 15 Chicago hospitals reporting, 5.4% of       emergency department visits were due to influenza- like illness (i.e. fever of 100°F or greater, with  cough or sore throat).  Pediatric hospitals continue  to experience higher rates, but in hospitals serving  adults levels of activity are comparable to what was  reported in late September and early October, 2009  (figure 2).  Among seven outpatient clinics report- ing for the week of January 24 –  30, 2010, 2.4%  of doctor’s office visits were due to influenza-like  illness.  This level of activity is similar to levels  seen during the same surveillance week during  previous influenza seasons.   Figure 2. Weekly reported percent of emergency department visits  attributed to influenza-like illness in two Chicago pediatric hospitals,  and all Chicago hospitals serving adults (combined), August 30,  2009—January 30, 2010.         Which influenza strains are circulating?   For the week of January 24 –  30, 2010, with seven  laboratories reporting, all 8 influenza A-positive  specimens for which subtyping was performed  were reported as confirmed or presumptive pan- demic influenza A (H1N1). No seasonal influenza  A or influenza B strains were reported.                                                                                                                 Where can I get more information?        This month’s edition of CDPH’s CD Info newsletter1 provides supplemental information about the surveillance  and investigation of the 2009 pandemic in Chicago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s FluView2  report provides national updates and trends related to the intensity of influenza activity across the United States, as  well as detailed information on antiviral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics. Updates specific to Illinois3  and Suburban Cook County4 are also available online.      1 http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_EDITORIAL/CDInfoNewsletterFebruary.pdf  2 http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/; 3 http://www.idph.state.il.us/flu/fluupdate09-10.htm; 4 http://www.cookcountypublichealth.org/flu_current_situation

This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,337 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Grant Place, from N.  Geneva Terrace to N. Clark Street. The old pipe dates back to 1906 and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Smith’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.

WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,337 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Grant Place, from N. Geneva Terrace to N. Clark Street.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1906 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late May 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Grant Place outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late May 2013.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?

Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about  vaccine availability.  For those without a healthcare provider or whose healthcare providers do not have the  influenza vaccine, a schedule of City of Chicago influenza vaccination clinics is available on the City website  and by calling 311.  To locate the closest City of Chicago clinic or retail pharmacy, go to  www.chicagoflushots.org.    The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has issued influenza testing and reporting recommendations2;  healthcare facilities can report cases to the Chicago Department of Public Health via INEDSS3.                          What is the risk?     Currently, the risk of influenza infection is low.                                                                                                                               Figure 1. Number of influenza-associated intensive care unit  hospitalizations reported for Chicago residents, for current season  (2016-2017) by influenza type, October-May.   Are severe cases of influenza occurring?                                                                                                                       During surveillance week 45, one influenza- associated ICU hospitalization was reported which  was positive for influenza B by rapid test (Figure 1).     Since October 2, 2016, 3 influenza-associated ICU  hospitalizations have been reported; one was posi- tive for influenza A (unknown subtype [subtyping not  attempted or not all subtypes tested]) and two were  positive for influenza B.        How much influenza-like illness is occurring?                                                                                        CDPH receives data from influenza surveillance  sites across Chicago, which report the total number  of patient visits seen weekly, and of those visits, the  number with influenza-like illness (ILI) (i.e., fever of  100°F or greater, with cough or sore throat).     Figure 2. Percent of emergency department visits attributed to  influenza-like illness based on manual reports by individual  hospitals, Chicago, by week, for the current season (2016-2017)  and previous three seasons, October-May.   Several hospitals in Chicago that provide emergent  care report on  a weekly basis the total number of  emergency department visits, and of those visits, the  number with ILI.  For surveillance week 45, with nine  hospitals reporting, 3.0% of emergency department  visits were due to ILI (Figure 2).     ESSENCE is an electronic syndromic surveillance  system that utilizes emergency department chief  complaint data submitted daily by Chicago hospitals.   ILI activity is determined solely based on the pa- tient’s chief complaint and does not take into ac- count the entire medical record, as the ILI activity  reported in Figure 2 does.     Currently, 27 Chicago hospitals submit data to      ESSENCE, covering nearly every emergency department visit in the city of Chicago. For surveillance week  45, 1.5% of all emergency department visits were due to ILI; Northside hospitals had slightly higher ILI at  1.7%, Southside hospitals at 1.6% and Westside hospitals had the lowest at 1.2% (Figure 3).      1 https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/influenza/2015-influenza-walk-in-clinic-schedule.html                                                                                           2 http://www.dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ohp-labs-influenzaannual-testing-and-reportingmemo-09222016.pdf;3 https://dph.partner.illinois.gov/   Chicago Flu Update - 1      Several outpatient clinics throughout Chicago participate  in CDC’s Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network  (ILINet) by reporting on the number of patients with ILI  seen weekly.  For surveillance week 45, with 23 facili- ties reporting, 4.6% of outpatient visits were due to  influenza-like illness (Figure 4).       Figure 3. Percent of emergency department visits attributed to  influenza-like illness by hospital region based on chief complaint  data submitted to ESSENCE, Chicago, by week, for the current  season (2016-2017) and previous season (2015-2016), October -May.   Which influenza strains are circulating?                                                                                                                                 Data on influenza virus test results are reported by  Chicago laboratories performing influenza RT-PCR.  For surveillance week 45, with 6 laboratories reporting,  1 of the 478 specimens tested for influenza was posi- tive for influenza A (H3N2).   Since October 2, 2016, 6 of 2,849 specimens tested  for influenza were positive; all typed as influenza A (4  H3N2 and 2 (unknown subtype [subtyping not attempt- ed or not all subtypes tested]) (Figure 5).

Burke’s (14th Ward) request, I am providing you with information  regarding a water construction project in your neighborhood. This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,345 feet of 8-inch water main in W. 38th Place, from S.  Kedzie Avenue to S. Sacramento Avenue and S. Albany Avenue, from W. 37th Place to W.  Pershing Road. The old pipe dates back to 1895, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Burke’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                SHEMP HOWARD      •  The first professional football game was played.  •  Wilhelm Roentgen (Germany) discovered a form of radiation later known as X-rays.  •  Shemp Howard of The Three Stooges was born.  •  The term “Salisbury Steak” was used for the first time; the dish was named after Dr.   James Henry Salisbury, who advocated eating beef three times a day for health benefits.   •  The first female PhD (science) was earned by Caroline Willard Baldwin.  •  Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prize.  •  The world’s first movie theater opened in Paris, France.                                   38TH PL. AND ALBANY AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,345 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. 38th Place, from S. Kedzie Avenue to S. Sacramento Avenue and S. Albany  Avenue, from W. 37th Place to W. Pershing Road.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1895 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late October 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow W. 38th Place and S. Albany Avenue outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN EDWARD M. BURKE    773- 523-8250   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late October 2013.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.   Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  These  screens should be removed prior to flushing.  This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement.  If you have any  questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.           DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

The proposed special use complies with all applicable standards of this Zoning  Ordinance;   2.  The proposed special use is in the interest of the public convenience as it will allow  clients of CryoSpa to  have massages on-site and will not adversely impact the general  welfare of the neighborhood;   3.  The proposed special use is compatible with the character of the surrounding area in  terms of site planning and building scale and project design because the proposed special  use will utilize an already existing building;   4.  The proposed special use is compatible with the character of the surrounding area in  terms of operating characteristics, such as hours of operation, outdoor lighting, noise and  traffic generation because the proposed special use will be in addition to the Applicant's  existing business at the subject property;   5.  The proposed special use is designed to promote pedestrian safety and comfort as the  special use will utilize an already existing building;   RESOLVED, the Board finds that the Applicant has proved its case by testimony and   evidence covering the five  specific criteria of Section 17-13-0905-A of the Chicago  Zoning Ordinance.   RESOLVED, the aforesaid special use application is hereby approved, and the   Zoning Administrator is authorized to permit said special use subject to the following  conditions, pursuant to the authority granted by Section 17-13-0906 of the Chicago  Zoning Ordinance:   1.  The Applicant shall ensure that an unobstructed view is maintained through the   front door and windows from the public right-of-way into the facility;   2.  The primary use of the subject property shall remain CryoSpa and the massage   salon shall only be incidental to said primary use.

I want to be certain you are well  informed about the project, and that you know where to call if you have any  questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,279 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Manistee  Avenue, from E. 92nd Street to E. 94th Street. The old pipe dates back to 1891 and  needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Pope’s office, and he has made clear we are to  put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the  key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise. We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman John Pope        10th Ward                                                   Do you wonder what was happening in 1891?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                   Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap   and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.                        MANISTEE WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,279 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Manistee Avenue, from E. 92nd Street to E. 94th Street.        Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1891 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late July. Restoration will follow in late August. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Manistee without interruption, but we will have to  restrict parking around our work zone.  .   Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1            ALDERMAN JOHN POPE   773-721-1999   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July.  Restoration will follow in late August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,968 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Arthur Avenue, from N. Glenwood Avenue to N. Sheridan Road, N. Magnolia  Avenue, from W. Arthur Avenue to W. Devon Avenue, and N. Lakewood Avenue, from W.  Arthur Avenue to W. Devon Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1911 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in mid September 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Arthur Avenue, N. Magnolia Avenue, and N.  Lakewood Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to  close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business,  even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open  for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOSEPH MOORE   773-338-5796   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid September  2014. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 568 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Kilbourn Avenue, from W.  Armitage Avenue to W. Cortland Street. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Suarez’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Ray Suarez             31st Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          Do you wonder what was happening in 1890?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       CY YOUNG IN ACTION           Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                                     WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 568 feet of 8-inch water  main in N. Kilbourn Avenue, from W. Armitage Avenue to W. Cortland Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late April.  Restoration will follow in late May. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN RAY SUAREZ   773-486-6488      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE          312-742-1029                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late April.  Restoration will be completed in late May. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since  we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,261 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Keating Avenue, from W.  63rd Street to W. 65th Street. The old pipe dates back to 1916, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Quinn’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

Keating Avenue, from W. 63rd Street to W. 65th Street.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1916 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in April. Final restoration will follow in May. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.
