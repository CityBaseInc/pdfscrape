Desctibe  ttre requirement and how it evolved from initial planning  to its pfesent  status. The Depattment of Ptocutement  Services identified a need for an application to m^rtage the Department's Cetification and Compliance  data. A Request  for Services  (""RFS"") was issued  undet the City's Mastet Consulting Agreements  for IT Management.  Aftet  catefi.rl review  and evaluation  of the proposals,  a task  order was issued to the selected  vendor, Los Alamos Technical  Associates,  Inc. (""r-q.TA"").  LATA's ptoposal included a hosted solution petformed  by their subcontractor, ASKREPLY,  Inc. d/b/a B2GNow,  the company that owns the proprietary  code  rhat is being used for rJr,e C2 proglam. IATA's ptoposed  solution, inciuding B2GNow, was evaluated  as pârt of a competitive  evaluation process and selected as best qualified to meet the City's tequitement.  The City's approved task order agreement with I-ATA cont¿ined a provision  ¡hat annual hosted servíce will be contracted ditectly  between  the City and B2GNow.  B2GNow tetains ownership  of the code  and will continue  to host the ptogtam. DPS is working  urith B2GNow to enhance their standatd code to meet our requirernents. In addition, B2GNow  has existing  contracts with numerous othet government  and private  endties, and  arly benefits given to these  otler entities  in the future will also  be rnade  avulable  to the City.

Rhee Chief Procurement Officer  FROM:  Benjamin Ho W*,,rp4T-  Deputy Procurement Officer  SUBJECT: REQUEST  FOR VENDOR LIMIT INCREASE & TIME  EXTENSION CURRENT PO NUMBER:  18455 CURRENT SPECIFICATION  NUMBER=  684þ.2 VENDOR:  ASKREPLY, INC. (DBA/B2GNOW)  The Department of Procurement Services (DPS) requests permission  to initiate  an amendment to the existing maintenance and support agreement (PO # 18455) with B2GNow,  the contractor for our hosted Certification  and Compliance (C2) system. Utilization of Minority-Owned,  Women-Owned  and Disadvantaged-Owned  Business Enterprises (MWDBE)  is a critical part of.the City of Chicago Procurement process.  The certification and awarding  of contracts  to MWDBE firms as primes  and/or subcontractors  is managed,  tracked and reported  via the C2 system.  C2 utilizes B2GNow's Diversity Management  System, which is a proprietary  system  that has been developed exclusively by B2GNow  and is hosted exclusively by B2GNow. No other company is qualified, authorized, or able to provide  the software and services for the C2 system.  The system has been in use at the City since December 15, 2008.  For the time extension, DPS will exercise  the last option to extend  for two years provided in the contract  for the period December 15,2016 to December 14,2018 During  this time, DPS will develop an RFP to solicit competitive proposals  for a vendor for a replacement  contract.  The vendor limit increase  of $303,713.75 covers anticipated maintenance  and support and anticipated additional work for enhancements and special projects through the extension period. DolT pays the annual software maintenance/support fees and concurs in the vendor limit increase  and time extension.  DolT's email of concurrence is attached.  CERTIFICATE  OF FILING  FOR  SURE S  Date of This Filing:1011312016  04:17  PM Original  Filing Date:7011312016  04:17  PM  Title :Chief  Operating Officer  EDS Number:  96108 Certificate  Printed  on: l0l 13 12016  Disclosing  Party:  AskReply, Inc.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,200 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Hirsch Street, from N.  Kostner Avenue to N. Keeler Avenue, and in N. Tripp Avenue, from W. Grand Avenue to W.  Hirsch Street. The old pipe dates back to 1900, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Mitts’ office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Emma Mitts               37th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1              Do you wonder what was happening in 1900?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:               HAMBURGER                  Hawaii became a U.S. territory.    The hamburger was created by Louis Lassing in Connecticut.    Actor Spencer Tracy was born.    The U.S. Navy’s first submarine made its debut.    The second modern Olympic Games opened in Paris, and lasted for 5 months.    L. Frank Baum wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.    The first electric bus became operational in New York City.    English handwriting experts established the art of calligraphy.                WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,200 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Hirsch Street, from N. Kostner Avenue to N. Keeler Avenue, and in N. Tripp  Avenue, from W. Grand Avenue to W. Hirsch Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1900 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in November. Final restoration will follow in late May 2015. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN EMMA MITTS   773-745-2894                           FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in November. Final  restoration will be completed in late May 2015. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

Of  1,557  newly  diagnosed  HIV  infections  in  Chicago  during  2006,  the  Chicago  Department  of  Public  Health  (CDPH)  estimates  that  approximately  62%  were  among  MSM1.    Forty-two  percent  (42%)  of  these  MSM  diagnoses  were  among  Blacks,  36%  were  among  Whites,  17%  were  among  Hispanics  and  5%  were  among  other  races.    Through  2006,  there  were  21,367  persons  living  with  HIV  in  Chicago;  of  those,  54.7%, or 11,697, were MSM2.    To assess sexual and drug use risk behaviors and HIV prevalence among MSM, CDPH analyzed data from  the  National  HIV  Behavioral  Surveillance  (NHBS-Chicago)  system  in  Chicago.  This  report  summarizes  preliminary findings from the NHBS-Chicago (2008), which indicated that, HIV prevalencea among MSM  was 17.4% (of 524 MSM tested, 91 MSM tested HIV-positive) and that 50% of MSM who tested positive  were unaware of their HIV infection at the time of the survey.  This report aims to describe rates of HIV  prevalence  and  of  unrecognized  infection  in  detail,  and  explore  the  differences  in  rates  among  racial/ethnic groups of MSM in Chicago.   Methods      NHBS is a national, ongoing surveillance system that collects cross-sectional data in 21 US cities among  populations  at  high  risk  for  acquiring  HIV,  including  MSM,  injection-drug  users,  and  heterosexuals-at- high-risk. This system is known in Chicago as Project  CHAT.   For the  MSM cycle conducted in  Chicago  during 2008, men were sampled systematically from randomly selected venues where MSM congregate  (e.g.,  bars/dance  clubs,  athletic  leagues,  professional  groups,  hobby/special  interest  organizations,  public sex environments, gay pride events, retail stores, and street locations). Formative research was  conducted from January through July 2008 to garner community support, and identify venues, as well as  days and times when MSM frequented these venues.  Data collection took place from August through  December  2008.    Men  attending  venues  were  randomly  approached  and  were  asked  if  they  were  interested in participating and undergoing eligibility screening.  Men eligible for the survey were aged  >18  years  and  residents  of  the  Chicago  metropolitan  statistical  area  (MSA).  Using  a  standardized  questionnaire, men were interviewed about their sexual and drug-use behaviors, HIV-testing behavior,  and  use  of  HIV-prevention  services.    Eligible  participants  were  also  offered  HIV  testing  following  the  survey.  Participants were compensated up to $50 for the time and effort required for taking the survey  and HIV test.                                                               a HIV prevalence is defined as the proportion of people within a specific population that are currently living with HIV.         STI/HIV/AIDS Chicago    2   July 2009                  The  OraSure®  HIV  test  was  used  to  screen  blood  specimens  for  HIV  antibodies.  Initially-reactive  specimens  were  tested  by  Western  blot  for  confirmation  at  the  Illinois  Department  of  Public  Health  laboratories.    Participants  were  asked  about  the  date  and  result  of  their  most  recent  HIV  test  before  being tested for HIV as part of NHBS.  If a participant reported having tested HIV-positive prior to the  survey, they were asked the date of their most recent HIV-negative test.  Men who had not been HIV  tested during the year prior to the survey were asked about their reasons for not testing.    Results   Demographics  In Chicago, 669 men sampled from 57 different venues participated in NHBS-Chicago.  A  total  of  570 men  reported  having  had one  or more  male  sex  partners  in the  past  year.   Of  these  570  participants, the mean age was 32 years (range: 18-70 years); 27% were Black,  44% were White, 22%  Hispanic, 3% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 3% reported Multiracial or Other.  Overall, respondents in the  sample were relatively evenly distributed by annual household income.  Twenty-seven percent (27%) of  respondents had annual incomes between $0 and $19,999, 37% had annual incomes between $20,000  and $49,999, and 34% of respondents had incomes over $50,000. The majority (77%) of respondents in  the  sample  were  high-school  graduates  or  higher  (Table  1).  Each  of  Chicago’s  zip  codes  were  represented  by  at  least  one  survey  participant.    There  were  3  geographical  areas  of  the  city  that  represented  the  largest  concentration  of  participants:    1)  Lakeview/Uptown/Edgewater,  2)  Auburn- Gresham, and 3) Logan Square/ West Town.   Fifty-nine respondents (10%) reported residence outside  of the city (Figure 1).      STI/HIV/AIDS Chicago    3   July 2009         TABLE 1.

These  included:  bars  (41%),  dance  clubs  (20%),  social  organizations  (14%),  street  locations  (12%),  sex  environments (6%), gay pride events (5%), and retail stores (3%).   Examples of social organizations were  athletic  leagues,  hobby/special  interest  group  meetings,  and  church  services.    Sex  environments  consisted  of  bathhouses,  parks,  beaches,  and  back  rooms  of  bars  where  sexual  activity  took  place.   Recruitment  on  sidewalk  corridors  occurred  in  areas  of  the  city  that  are  well-known  neighborhoods  where MSM live and congregate.    HIV Prevalence  Ninety-two percent (92%) of survey participants agreed to be tested for HIV.  Of the 524  MSM tested for HIV during the  2008 NHBS survey, 91 men tested HIV-positive.  Thus, the overall HIV  prevalence  rate  among  participants  was  17.4%.  HIV  prevalence  increased  stepwise  by  each  age  category.    Among  MSM  18-24  years  of  age,  the  prevalence  rate  was  13.6%.  For  those  older  than  45  years of age, the prevalence rate was 22%.   The examination of prevalence rates among MSM by race/ethnicity revealed stark disparities between  groups.  The HIV prevalence rate among all Black MSM in the sample was 30.1% (44 positives out of 146  tested).  This rate was almost three times that of White MSM (11.4%, 26 positives out of 229 tested),  and two-and-a-half times that of Hispanic MSM (12.0%, 14 positives out of 117 tested) (Table 2).     Reliable prevalence rates were unable to be calculated for other racial/ethnic groups due to the small  numbers  surveyed.    The  remainder  of  this  report,  which  aims  to  explore  the  implications  of  these  prevalence rates, will focus only on MSM who reported Black or White race, or Hispanic ethnicity.                               STI/HIV/AIDS Chicago    6   July 2009                  Unrecognized  Infection    Half  of  all  MSM  (50%)  who  tested  positive  for  HIV  during  the  survey  were  unaware of their HIV infection.  An individual who was “unaware” of his HIV infection was defined as  someone who tested HIV-positive at the time of survey and had either reported their most recent HIV  test result to be negative, or who reported no lifetime HIV test, or that they did not receive the results  of their most recent HIV test and have not received a previous positive HIV test result.  Sixty-six percent  (66%)  of  Black  MSM  who  tested  positive  in  the  sample  were  unaware  of  their  HIV  infection,  50%  of  Hispanic MSM, and nearly one-quarter of White MSM (23%) were unaware of their HIV infection at the  time of the survey (Table 4).

Respondents Unaware of their HIV Positive Status by Race/Ethnicity    (National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System, Men Who Have Sex With Men, Chicago,     August 2008 - December 2008) (n=84)         Total HIV+    Unaware HIV+   %   Black   White   Hispanic   TOTAL    (#)   44   26   14   84   (#)   29   6   7   42   66   23   50   50            HIV Testing and Health Behaviors of MSM Unaware of Their HIV Infection  HIV testing behaviors are,  overall, similar among MSM who were unaware of their HIV infection and those MSM who tested HIV  negative  during  the  survey.    Eighty-eight  percent  (88%)  of  the  men  who  were  unaware  of  their  HIV  infection had been tested for HIV in their lifetime (compared to 92% of HIV- negative MSM).  Sixty-one  percent (61%) of MSM who were unaware of their HIV infection had reported taking at least two HIV  tests in the past two years (compared to 67% of HIV negative MSM in the sample) (Table 5).     Over half (62%) of MSM who were unaware of their HIV-positive status reported taking an HIV test in  the past 12 months.  For the 17 MSM who were unaware of their infection and had  not tested in the  past  year,  the  most  commonly  reported  main  reason  for  not  testing  was  that  they  were,  “afraid  of  finding out  the result”.  The  second most  common reason cited was,  “I think I’m at low  risk for HIV”.      STI/HIV/AIDS Chicago    9   July 2009                  None of the MSM who were unaware of their infection reported that they ‘didn’t know where to go to  get tested’ as a reason for not getting tested for HIV.   The  majority  of  HIV-positive  MSM  who  were  unaware  of  their  HIV  infection  reported  being  currently  insured and  were  receiving medical care.  Sixty percent  (60%) of those  unaware  of their HIV infection  reported  currently  having  some  form  of  health  insurance  (compared  to  72%  of  HIV-negative  MSM),  while 82% had reported visiting a health care provider for medical care in the past year (compared to  79% of HIV-negative MSM) (Table 5).

Sixty-nine  (69%)  percent  of  Black  MSM and 57% of Hispanic MSM who were unaware of their infection tested HIV-negative less than 12  months prior to the survey.  This compares to 33% of White MSM who reported an HIV-negative test  result within 12 months of the survey (Table 6).                  STI/HIV/AIDS Chicago    10   July 2009

By mid January 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Reliable Contracting  & Equipment Company crews will begin the work to install 1,424 feet of new 8-inch water  main in S. Rhodes Avenue, from E. 61st Street to E. 63rd Street.  The old water main dates  back to 1898, and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please  go to www.buildinganewchicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply  enter your name, email address and the project identification number at the top of this  letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each  new construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the  installation of new pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but  you will always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the  start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:     •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  20th Ward Office: 773-955-5610  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will  interrupt water service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in  the event of an emergency shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you  prior warning.   After the old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to the new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for several  minutes.  The aerator screens located at the tip of your faucets should be removed prior to  flushing.    This flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, or any  particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line as a result of  the water main replacement.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water  quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.     Sincerely,    Thomas Powers  Commissioner

This is part of our approach  to renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with  you our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed  about the project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 918 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Wells Street, from  W. Root Street to W. 43rd Street. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Dowell’s office, and she has made clear we are to  put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood  through the whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the  project closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct  ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.

That’s the year the old water main was  installed beneath your street.  Among other things:       CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were   born.                     SOUTH WELLS STREET WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 918 feet of 8- inch water main in S. Wells Street, from W. Root Street to W. 43rd Street.      Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further,  the old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late August 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Wells Street outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety.  You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If  you have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also  call Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the  voicemail message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside  of our working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the  workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late August  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the  services from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour  notice when this is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old  pipe will break.  They can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If  we do this, we will let you know what is happening, even though we may be unable to  give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be  good neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By  working together, we can complete this important project as friends working for the  improvement of our community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your  neighbors to reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective  response as the only strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood  basis to work with us on practical steps (public and private) to protect your  property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters  to monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for  only the water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while  protecting one of our most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This  means that with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their  water bills.      Homeowner Incentives         Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:   A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the   meter had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit  www.metersave.org, call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account  number ready.  Space is limited based on funding availability and the number of  volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter  complete with the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of  charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to  Water Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1   place inside the home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount  of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this  limited time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise,  Water Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the  sustainability of our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500  gallons per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household  water consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water  consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This  saves 25 gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers  typically use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in  the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use  by 20-50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use  thousands of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save  money and water by preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45  million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could  face severe water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the  Chicago Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water  from Lake Michigan.               Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!

Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in early September 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Lowell Avenue and W. Roscoe Street outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement.

General Licensing Provisions Ruling # 2005-1  Uniform Revenue Procedures Ruling # 4  Subject:  License Holds for Tax Liabilities  Effective date:  March 1, 2005    Section 1.  Chicago Municipal Code (“Code”) Section 4-4-150(b) provides that, with  certain exceptions set forth in Section 4-4-150(c), “No initial or renewal license shall be  issued to any license applicant who has acquired any outstanding debt, unless and until  such person satisfies all outstanding debts or by authority of the city council discharges  all  such  indebtedness  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  fixed  by  the  city  council.”    Section 2.  Code  Section  4-4-150(c)  provides  that,  notwithstanding  Section  4-4- 150(b),  the  City  may  issue  an  initial  or  renewal  license  if  (1)  the  license  applicant  (“applicant”)  has  entered  into  an  agreement  for  the  payment  of  its  debts  and  is  in  compliance with the agreement; or (2) the applicant is contesting liability for the debts in  a pending audit or administrative or judicial proceeding; or (3) the applicant has filed a  petition in bankruptcy and the debts owed are dischargeable in bankruptcy.    Section 3.  Code Section 4-4-150(a), (1) states that, as used in Section 4-4-150, the  term  “debt”  includes,  among  other  things,  “any  unpaid  tax  liability,  whether  or  not  an  assessment has been issued.”    Section 4.  an “unpaid tax liability” will be deemed to exist only in the following situations:       For the purpose of creating a license hold under Code Section 4-4-150(b),    where a final assessment has been issued and is unpaid; or   a.   b.   c.   a.   b.   where  the  applicant  is  registered  for  a  tax  and  is  delinquent  in  filing  a       complete tax return for that tax, and the delinquency has not been cured; or      where the applicant has filed a tax return which provides information to  the  Department  of  Revenue  (“Department”)  allowing  for  the  computation  of  a  tax  liability  which  after  application  of  all  applicable  payments  and  remittances  leaves  a  deficiency balance due that has not been cured.    Section 5.  For the purpose of creating a license hold under Code Section 4-4- 150(b), an “unpaid tax liability” may be presumed by the Department where the applicant  is  the  subject  of  a  discovery investigation  and  has  failed  to  file  a  tax  return  and  make  payment  which,  based  on  the  nature  of  the  applicant’s  business,  would  ordinarily  be  expected.  After a notice of this presumption is provided to the applicant, the applicant  may  rebut  this  presumption  by  providing  to  the  Department  reliable  information  and  documentation to explain why the applicant has not filed a tax return.      Upon written request of an applicant, where a dispute exists as to whether  or not an applicant has provided sufficient information and documentation to rebut the  presumption described in Section 5(a), the Director of the Department (“Director”) will  refer the matter to the problems resolution committee authorized by Code Section 3-4- 152 (“Committee”), in which case the applicant will be given an opportunity to present  its case informally to the Committee.  Such requests for review shall be submitted to the  Director  within  fourteen  business  days  of  receiving  the  Department’s  notice  of  an  applicant’s failure to rebut the presumption described in Section 5(a).    After the Committee has completed its review, either the Department will confirm that  the  presumption  described  in  this  Section  5  has  been  rebutted,  or  the  Department  may  uphold the presumption.  If the Department confirms that the applicant has successfully  rebutted the presumption of liability, the Department will notify the applicant in writing  and  immediately  remove  its  license  hold  to  allow  the  applicant  to  obtain  required  business  licenses.    The  applicant  shall  acquire  all  applicable  licenses  within  seven  business  days  of  receipt  of  such  notice,  if  in  fact  the  applicable  license  period  has  commenced.    If the Committee upholds a presumption of liability, it shall notify the applicant of this  fact in writing.  Unless the taxpayer files applicable tax returns and makes all applicable  tax payments within 10 days of such notice, the Committee staff shall direct appropriate  Department  personnel  to  issue  a  notice  of  tentative  determination  of  claim.  In  such  instances, the Department shall issue any initial or renewal license if a timely protest of  the tentative determination is filed.        During  the  course  of  the  process  outlined  in  Sections  5(a)  and  (b),  no  notice of violation or cease and desist order will be issued by the Department as a result  of an applicant’s failure to obtain a license strictly due to the presumed liability described  in this Section 5.  Any previously-issued cease and desist orders or notices of violation   c.   shall  be  stayed  during  the  period  of  review  by  the  Committee,  if  the  only  hold  on  the  account is the result of a presumed liability, as described in this Section 5.  No penalties  or fines for the failure to have or display a required license will be accrued or incurred  during any period of review or stay under this provision, if the only hold on the account is  the result of a presumed liability, as described in this Section 5.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you, our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon install a new sewer pipe in N. LeClaire Avenue, from W. Argyle Street to  W. Gunnison Street. The old sewer dates back to 1950 and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Arena’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.       Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     Cc: Alderman John Arena         45th Ward                                                1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                Do you know wonder what was happening in 1950? That’s the year the old sewer main was  installed beneath your street. Among other things:                   The first Peanuts comic strip from October 2, 1950        Walt Disney released its animated film “Cinderella”.     President Harry S. Truman ordered the development of the hydrogen bomb.     Bob Hope made his first appearance on television.     The first kidney transplant was performed, in Chicago.       The comic strip “Peanuts” by Charles Schulz was first published, in seven U.S.  newspapers.      In New York, the first payment was made with a charge card (Diners Club).                              PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon install a new sewer pipe in N.  LeClaire Avenue, from W. Argyle Street to W. Gunnison Street.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1950 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by  Argyle on the north, Gunnison on the south,  Lavergne on the east, and Laramie on the west will  benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Construction will begin shortly, and is expected to be done in April. Restoration will  follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable  change, we will notify you.   Traffic:   We will continue to allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours. When we are  working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able  to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place. Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.             CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN JOHN ARENA   773-286-4545      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029             FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS           Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Arena, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!      
11370`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/cacc/PDFiles/Cold_Weather_Pet_Care.pdf`Success`Success`1`1`Not a fillable PDF.`Cold Weather Pet Care   In Chicago, winter is a season of bitter cold and numbing wetness. Help your pets  remain happy and healthy during the colder months by following these simple  guidelines:    •  Don't leave dogs outdoors when the temperature drops. Most dogs, and all   cats, are safer indoors, except when taken out for exercise. Regardless of the  season, shorthaired, very young or old dogs and all cats should never be left  outside without supervision. Short-coated dogs may feel more comfortable  wearing a sweater during walks.    •  No matter what the temperature, windchill can threaten a pet's life. A dog or   cat is happiest and healthiest when kept indoors.    •  The salt and other chemicals used to melt snow and ice can irritate the pads  of your pet's feet. Wipe the feet with a damp towel before your pet licks them  and irritates his/her mouth.    •  Antifreeze is a deadly poison, but it has a sweet taste that may attract animals  and children. Wipe up spills and store antifreeze (and all household chemicals)  out of reach. Better yet, use antifreeze-coolant made with propylene glycol; if  swallowed in small amounts, it will not hurt pets, wildlife, or your family.    •  Warm engines in parked cars attract cats and small wildlife, who may crawl up  under the hood. To avoid injuring any hidden animals, bang on your car's hood  to scare them away before starting your engine.   CHICAGO ANIMAL CARE AND CONTROL STRONGLY RECOMMENDS KEEPING  COMPANION ANIMALS INSIDE YOUR HOME! Probably the best prescription for  winter's woes is to keep your dog or cat inside with you and your family. The happiest  dogs are those who are taken out frequently for walks and exercise but kept inside  the rest of the time. Dogs and cats are social animals who crave human  companionship. Your animal companions deserve to live indoors with you and your  family.    If your dog is an outdoor dog, however:    •  Your dog must be protected by a dry, draft-free doghouse that is large enough   to allow the dog to sit and lie down comfortably, but small enough to hold in  his/her body heat. The floor should be raised a few inches off the ground and  covered with cedar shavings or straw. The house should be turned to face  away from the wind, and the doorway should be covered with waterproof  burlap or heavy plastic.    •  Pets that spend a lot of time outdoors need more food in the winter because  keeping warm depletes energy. Routinely check your pet's water dish to make  certain the water is fresh and unfrozen. Use plastic food and water bowls  rather than metal; when the temperature is low, your pet's tongue can stick  and freeze to metal.
