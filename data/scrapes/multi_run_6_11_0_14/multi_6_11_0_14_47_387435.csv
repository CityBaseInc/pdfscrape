This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 4,373 feet of 8-inch and 1,016 feet of 12-inch water main in S.  Wells Street, from W. 26th Street to W. 31st Street, W. 28th Place, from S. Stewart Avenue to S.  Wentworth Avenue, W. 30th Street, from S. Canal Street to S. Wentworth Avenue. The old pipe  dates back to 1872 and needs to be replace. Additionally, our crews will be abandoning 531 feet  of 6-inch water main in S. Stewart Avenue, from W. 29th Place to W. 30th Place.     We are coordinating with Alderman Balcer’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                    VICTORIA WOODHULL      •  Bloomingdale’s department store opened in New York City.  •  Thomas J. Martin patented the fire extinguisher.  •  Charlotte Ray, the first African American female lawyer, graduated from Harvard   University.   •  Arbor Day was celebrated for the first time, in Nebraska.  •  The Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College began its first academic session. The   university was later renamed Virginia Tech.   •  Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to be nominated for President of the United   States, although she was a year too young to qualify and did not appear on the ballot.             WELLS ST., 28TH PL., 30TH ST. & STEWART AVE. WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon installing 4,373 feet of 8-inch and  1,016 feet of 12-inch water main in S. Wells Street, from W. 26th Street to W. 31st Street, W. 28th  Place, from S. Stewart Avenue to S. Wentworth Avenue, W. 30th Street, from S. Canal Street to  S. Wentworth Avenue. Additionally, our crews will be abandoning 531 feet of 6-inch water main  in S. Stewart Avenue, from W. 29th Place to W. 30th Place.    Reason:  The old pipe in S. Wells Street, W. 28th Place and W. 30th Street dates back to 1872  and needs to be replaced. Further, we can expect increasingly frequent breaks in the old main in  S. Stewart Avenue if we do not abandon the pipe and transfer the service. Water services will be  transferred to the existing 8-inch water main pipe.    Timing:  We will begin the installation and abandonment project shortly, and expect the water  main work to be completed in mid December 2014. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015.  Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change,  we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Wells Street, W. 28th Place, W. 30th Street and S.  Stewart Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to  close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business,  even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open  for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                                              CONTACT NUMBERS   ALDERMAN JAMES BALCER   773-254-6677       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.     Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in mid  December 2014. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015. We always hesitate to promise  specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere  in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

Domingo Macedo, President      Licensee/Revocation    for the premises located at       2360-62 North Clybourn          v.                                                         Department of Business Affairs & Consumer Protection   Local Liquor Control Commission   Norma I. Reyes, Commissioner                         OPINION OF CHAIRMAN FLEMING JOINED BY COMMISSIONER SCHNORF    ORDER   The licensee received notice that a hearing was to be held with respect to disciplinary   proceedings regarding the City of Chicago retail liquor license and all other City of Chicago   licenses issued to the licensee for the premises located at 2360-62 N. Clybourn, Chicago, Illinois.    It was alleged that on April 6, 2008, the licensee, by and through its agents, sold, permitted to be   sold or gave away alcoholic liquor between the hours of 3:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. on a Sunday in   violation of Section 4-60-130(a), of the Municipal Code of Chicago.       This matter proceeded to hearing at the Local Liquor Control Commission before Deputy   Hearing Commissioner John F. Lyke on October 6, 2008, and January 12, 2009.  The licensee   was represented by attorney Michael Buckley Bolan and the Local Liquor Control Commission   was represented by the Corporation Counsel=s office.    Subsequent to the completion of the hearing, Deputy Hearing Commissioner Lyke                       1   entered Findings of Fact that the City proved the charge and recommended the licensee=s licenses   be revoked.  Norma Reyes, the Commissioner of the Department of Business Affairs and   Consumer Protection/Local Liquor Control Commission, adopted those findings of fact.  The   licensee filed a timely Notice of Appeal and this matter proceeded to oral argument before this   Commission on May 21, 2009.  The licensee was represented by attorney Francis Ostian at oral   argument.            Section 4-60-130(a) of the Municipal Code states in pertinent part that:    no person licensed hereunder as a retailer of   alcoholic liquor shall sell, permit to be sold,   or give away any alcoholic liquor between the   hours of 3:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. on Sundays.    Since this case deals with a review of an order of revocation by the Local Liquor Control   Commissioner it is the function of this Commission to review the propriety of the order of the   local liquor control commissioner and to consider these questions:    (a)  Whether the local liquor control commissioner has proceeded in the   manner provided by law;   (b)  Whether the order is supported by the findings;     (c)  Whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in light of the   whole record;   This Commissioner may only consider evidence in the record of proceedings before the              local liquor control commissioner and no new evidence may be admitted or considered.    Sergeant Ralph Egan testified in the City=s case in chief and was then later called as a                       2   witness by the licensee.  In substance, Sergeant Egan testified he is the entertainment venue   sergeant in the 18th District with an assignment to patrol the nightclub and restaurant districts of   the 18th District.  On April 6, 2008, he was working and visited the location of 2360-62 N.   Clybourn to do a license check.  It was approximately 3:15 a.m.  He had checked his watch for   the time prior to entering the premises.  He observed on the premises approximately 15 patrons   drinking alcoholic drinks and he observed two or three patrons directly receive drinks from the   bartender.       The establishment had a food license and a consumption on premises alcohol license.    Sergeant Egan did not write down the names of the 15 persons he observed at the location and   did not identify what specific person was drinking what specific type of alcohol.  He determined   the drinks were alcoholic based on the fact the patrons were consuming bottles of beer.  The   bartender was actively working behind the bar pouring and serving drinks.  The police report   does not list the type of alcohol being served.  While he saw all the persons inside were drinking   he could not recall if anyone paid money.  His report does not reflect the bartender served   alcoholic beverages to any of the persons described as patrons.       The City also introduced its Exhibit #3, which is the past disciplinary history of the   licensee.  This history included a voluntary fine of $1,000 for two incidents which occurred on   October 13 and 27 of 2006 with respective case numbers L-06-0555 and L-06-0605.  In both of   these cases the licensee was charged with operating without a city liquor license, failure to   display consumption on premises license and failure to display retail food license.  The history                       3   also included a 30-day suspension on August 11, 2007, in case 07-LR-0219 for failure to display   consumption on premises license, failure to display retail food license, operating with expired   PPA license and keeper of a disorderly house.  It was noted that suspension was appealed to the   License Appeal Commission in case 08 LA 40.  No disposition of that appeal is in this record.       The licensee called Gil Sapir as an expert witness.  The gist of this testimony was that   one cannot definitely state a substance is alcoholic unless chemical tests are done on the   substance.       Counsel for the licensee made argument based on Mr. Sapir=s testimony.  Since the   substances that Sergeant Egan saw the patrons drinking were never inventoried and tested there   is insufficient evidence to establish alcohol was served.  If this was some type of felony that   required proof beyond a reasonable doubt and required strict proof of a chain of custody of the   evidence the argument might have merit.  In cases of ordinance violations dealing with proof of   alcohol the case law does not require such evidence.  People v. Isonhart, 259 Ill.App9(1930),   People vs. Rhodes, 243 Ill.App3d 201, 612 N.E. 2d536.       Sergeant Egan testified he saw fifteen patrons drinking alcohol after 3:00 a.m.  He   specifically saw the bartender pouring and serving two or three patrons.  Patrons were in   possession of beer bottles of Miller Lite.  The ordinance does not require proof of a sale of   alcoholic beverage.  Giving away alcohol after 3:00 a.m. is a violation of the ordinance.                           4   There has been no argument that the Local Liquor Control Commission did not proceed   in the manner provided by law.  The uncontradicted testimony of Sergeant Egan provided   sufficient basis.  This Commission found that the findings are supported by substantial evidence   in light of the whole record.  The order of revocation is supported by the findings.       The revocation of this liquor license issued to 2362, Inc. for the premises at 2360-62 N.   Clybourn is affirmed.  This Commissioner makes no ruling on the revocation of any other   licenses issued to 2362, Inc. by the City of Chicago since it does not have jurisdiction over those   licenses.                                                               5   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the order revoking the liquor   license of the APPELLANT is AFFIRMED.    Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a petition for rehearing may be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order  is deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the  Circuit Court, the petition for rehearing must be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days  after service of this order as such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,279 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Menard Avenue, from W.  Montrose Avenue to W. Berteau Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1915, and needs to be  replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Sposato’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Nicholas Sposato               38th Ward             1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          Do you wonder what was happening in 1915?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                              BILLIE HOLIDAY   In Washington D.C., the first stone of the Lincoln Memorial was put into place.     The U.S. House of Representatives rejected a proposal granting women the right to vote.      Pluto was photographed for the first time, but not recognized as a planet.    John B. Gruelle was given a patent for his Raggedy Ann doll.    American jazz and blues singer Billie Holiday was born.    The first stop sign appeared in Detroit, Michigan.    Woodrow Wilson became the first President to attend a World Series game.                              WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will install 1,279 feet of 8-inch water main in  N. Menard Avenue, from W. Montrose Avenue to W. Berteau Avenue.    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1915 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We expect our work to start shortly, and it will be completed in December. Final  restoration will follow in the spring of 2016. Dates may change depending on weather and other  factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN NICHOLAS SPOSATO   773-283-3838                        FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in December. Final  restoration will follow in the spring of 2016. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since  we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Currently, the risk of influenza infection continues to decrease.  However, influenza viruses are still circulating  and causing disease. Vaccination is the best way to protect against influenza infection and all Chicagoans aged six  months and older are encouraged to get vaccinated.  It is not too late to give or get an influenza vaccine. Chicago- ans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  For those without a healthcare  provider or whose healthcare providers do not have the influenza  vaccine, a list of City of Chicago Fast-Track  Immunization Clinics1 is available on the City website and by calling 311.  To locate the closest City of Chicago  clinic or retail pharmacy, go to www.chicagoflushots.org.     Figure 1. Number of influenza-associated intensive care unit   hospitalizations reported for Chicago residents, for current season  (2014-2015) and previous season (2013-2014), October-May.   Figure 2. Percent of emergency department visits attributed to  influenza-like illness based on manual reporting as determined by  individual hospitals, Chicago, by week, for the current season (2014- 2015) and previous three seasons, October-May.   Are severe cases of influenza occurring?   The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has  issued influenza testing and reporting guidelines2.   Suspected novel and variant influenza, pediatric influ- enza-associated deaths, influenza-associated ICU hos- pitalizations and outbreaks of influenza-like illness in  a congregate setting should all be reported to CDPH  via INEDSS3.      For the week of May 3-9, 2015, three influenza- associated ICU hospitalizations were reported; all  were positive for influenza B.      Since September 28, 2014, 296 influenza-associated  ICU hospitalizations have been reported (Figure 1).   Among the total ICU hospitalizations reported, 215  were positive for influenza A (110 H3N2, 2  H1N1pdm09, and 103 unknown subtype [subtyping  not attempted or not all subtypes tested]) and 81 were  positive for influenza B.  One hundred thirty-one  (44%) were non-Hispanic Black, 154 (52%) were fe- male, and 186 (63%) were 50 years of age or older  (median age of 61 years with a range of 1 month -101  years).  Ninety-six (32%) had reported lung disease  (including asthma) and 75 (25%) required ventilator  support.  Twenty-six deaths among ICU hospitaliza- tions have been reported.      How much influenza-like illness is occurring?   CDPH receives data from nearly 60 surveillance sites  across Chicago, which report the total number of pa- tient visits seen weekly, and of those visits, the num- ber with influenza-like illness (ILI) (i.e., fever of 100° F or greater, with cough or sore throat). All hospitals in Chicago that provide emergent care are required to report  on a weekly basis the total number of emergency department visits, and of those visits, the number with ILI.  For  the week of May 3-9, 2015 (week 18), with 13 hospitals reporting, 3.2% of emergency department visits were due  to ILI (Figure 2).        ESSENCE is an electronic syndromic surveillance system that utilizes emergency department chief complaint  data submitted daily by participating Chicago hospitals. ILI activity is determined solely based on the patient’s    chief complaint and does not take into account the entire medical record, as the ILI activity reported in Figure 2  does. Currently, 10 Chicago hospitals submit data to ESSENCE.  For the week of May 3-9, 2015, 1.1% of emer-  1http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/clinical_health/immunizations_walk-inclinics.html; 2http://www.idph.state.il.us/flu/OHPLabs- Influenza_annual_Testing_and_Reporting_Memo_01_10-2-2014.pdf; 3https://dph.partner.illinois.gov/   All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.    Figure 3.

Several outpatient clinics and two large outpatient  clinic networks located in Chicago participate  in  CDC’s Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network  (ILINet) by reporting on the number of patients with  ILI seen weekly.  From May 3-9, 2015 with 37 facili- ties reporting, 3.0% of visits were due to influenza- like illness (Figure 4).     Which influenza strains are circulating?   Data on influenza virus test results are reported by  Chicago laboratories performing influenza subtyping.  For the week of May 3-9, 2015, with 6 laboratories  reporting, 23 of the 517 (4.5%) specimens tested for  influenza were positive. Among this week’s positive  specimens, 1 was positive for influenza A (unknown  subtype) and 22 were positive for influenza B (Figure  4).      Since September 28, 2014, 2,576 of 18,577 (14%)  specimens tested for influenza have been positive;  1,822 typed as influenza A (11 H1N1pdm09, 1,492  H3N2 and 319 unknown subtype) and 754 were typed  as influenza B.      Where can I get more information?   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s       FluView4 report provides national updates and trends  related to the intensity of influenza activity across the  United States, as well as detailed information on anti- viral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics.  Updates specific to Illinois5 and Suburban Cook  County6 are also available online.  Current and ar- chived issues of the Chicago Flu Update can be found  on the CDPH website section Current Flu Situation in  Chicago7.  In 2013, the Metropolitan Chicago  Healthcare Council (MCHC) and CDPH released  “Stop the Spread: A Health Care Guide to Influenza  Preparedness”8.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,442 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Aberdeen Avenue, from  W. 99th Street to W. 103rd Street. The old pipe dates back to 1909, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Brookins’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Howard Brookins, Jr.                21st Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1              Do you wonder what was happening in 1909?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:               ERROL FLYNN        The first U.S. university school of nursing was established, at the University of   Minnesota.     Joan of Arc was declared a saint.    The first Lincoln head pennies were minted.    The Indianapolis 500 race track opened.    Actor Errol Flynn was born.    Workers began pouring concrete for the Panama Canal.    The first subway car with side doors went into service in New York City.                         WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,442 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Aberdeen Avenue, from W. 99th Street to W. 103rd Street.     Reason:  The old main dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in July. Restoration will follow in August. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN HOWARD BROOKINS, JR.   773-881-9300      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE          312-742-1029                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in July. Restoration  will be completed in August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

The Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) is  getting one step closer to paperless renewal of taxicab medallion licenses. This year BACP will  begin the “E-NOTICE” taxi medallion license renewal process.  The new process eliminates the  mailing of license renewal packets to taxicab medallion licensees.      NOTE:  Paper license renewal packets will NOT be mailed out to license holders or  license managers.    The following will be posted on the BACP Web site (www.cityofchicago.org/bacp):     Taxicab medallion license renewal information and checklist     Dates and times of taxicab medallion license renewal appointments     Dates and times of taxicab vehicle inspections for 2016   If you have not already done so, register your email address for your taxicab medallion license  account.  You may do so by sending an email to BACPPV@cityofchicago.org.  Write the taxicab  medallion license number and the name of the taxicab medallion license holder in the e-mail  “Subject Line”.      BACP encourages all licensees to resolve outstanding debt before January 1, 2016.  BACP  recommends that licensees investigate whether they have outstanding debt by either searching  the City’s Web site or by reading the Hold Notices sent by the Department of Finance.  Visit the  City of Chicago Department of Finance web page at www.cityofchicago.org/finance, to pay AH  Debt, Ground Transportation Tax, and Red Light or Parking Tickets.    Licensees should also check the status of their company in advance by visiting the Secretary of State’s  Web site Corporation/LLC Search/Certificate of Good Standing section at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.   However, for the purposes of submission to BACP for renewal, proof of good standing should be dated  after December 1, 2015.      License Managers should check the City of Chicago data portal now and reconcile their list of  clients with what is on the portal.  The City of Chicago Data Portal is posted at  data.cityofchicago.org.  If there are discrepancies in this data, is it the responsibility of the  licensees to rectify the discrepancy by either taking steps to register that taxi client with the  city or to remove that client from the list of managed clients.  If managers wish to make  changes, they should contact the Public Vehicle Office and submit the required forms.     License Managers and Affiliations must make appointments to come to 2350 W. Ogden to pick  up the renewal applications for their managed clients and affiliates.  Appointments will begin         on December 15th, 2015.  Independent (non-affiliated) medallion owners do not need an  appointment to come in to obtain their renewal application. Send all requests for renewal  application pickups and renewal appointment reschedules and consolidation requests to  BACCPV@cityofchicago.org.      Questions or comments about the E-NOTICE TAXI MEDALLION LICENSE RENEWAL process  should be sent to BACCPV@cityofchicago.org.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      ►  For questions, comments, or to join the City of Chicago's Department of Business Affairs and   Consumer Protection-Public Vehicle Operations (BACPPV) e-mail list to receive industry notices  and other news, send an email to BACPPV@cityofchicago.org.     ►  Rules and Regulations governing City of Chicago licensed public vehicles and public chauffeurs   are available at www.cityofchicago.org/bacp.    ►  The Municipal Code of Chicago is available at www.amlegal.com.

These appeals are brought before the License Appeal   Commission to challenge revocations, suspensions, or fines of existing liquor licenses by   the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection/Local Liquor Control   Commission.  In these matters, the disciplinary proceedings at the hearing level are   examined, reviewed, and appellate arguments are entertained.  Additionally, our   Commission has reviewing jurisdiction over denials of applications for new liquor   licenses.  Applicants who have been denied their request for a license are entitled to a   trial de novo to determine whether the denial of their application was appropriate.       The License Appeal Commission has collected, through the Department of Finance,   $2,125 in filing fees to date.  The Commission is budgeted for one full-time position.      As always, my office and I will work with the Office of Budget and Management and   members of City Council to continue to lower operation costs and provide savings to the   citizens of Chicago.

Jefferson is a multi-story vacant building constructed in 1946. The building was designed by Alfred S. Alschuler whose most visible work is the London Guarantee Building, a designated Chicago Landmark, located at 360 N. Michigan. The building was built occupied initially by the Newman-Rudolph Lithographing Company from 1946 through at least 1966.  The United States Army also occupied a portion of the subject property from the 1960's through the 1970's as an induction center for draftees.  The annex portion of the property was constructed in 1967 and used as a printing facility for billing statements by Comedy. Several printing companies and other office/commercial tenants have occupied portions of the building since the 1960's; however the building has been substantially vacant and underutilized for at least a decade.  It is also important to note that the Department of Housing and Economic Development's Historic Preservation staff has reviewed the building and the development proposal and concluded that due to the existing building's structural constraints and the rehabilitation necessary to convert the former lithography plant into offices, the necessary changes might not meet historic guidelines. However, the project will adaptively reuse this vacant structure within the spirit of the original design intent while meeting today's energy and office requirements.  Sara Lee Corporation (""Sara Lee"") traces its lineage to 1939, when Nathan Cummings acquired C.D. Kenny Company, a wholesale distributor of sugar, coffee and tea in Baltimore, and created Consolidated Foods Corporation. In 1956 Consolidated Foods Corporation bought a company known as Kitchens of Sara Lee and the Sara Lee name was adopted for the entire company in 1985.  In early 2010, Sara Lee announced a plan to split itself into two ""pure play"" companies by spinning off its International Beverage division (""Coffee Co""). The remaining portions of Sara Lee will consist of its North American Retail and North American Foodservice Divisions (""MeatCo""). Among the products produced by MeatCo include some of America's most recognized brands such as Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ballpark Franks. As a result of this restructuring, rather than continuing to share space with Coffee Co, MeatCo is considering a move of its corporate headquarters from its current location in Downers Grove to Chicago's West Loop area because the company believes the move would provide it with the competitive edge of being headquartered in a global city, and present the company with a higher marketing profile.  Sara Lee retained Colliers International to assist with the relocation of its headquarters facility, and has selected the 400 S. Jefferson St. as its Chicago location. Sara Lee is in the process of negotiating a lease with Sterling Interests LLC, the contract purchaser of the Property (""Landlord"") for between 200,000 and 220,000 square feet. Sara Lee also retained Bryan Cave LLP to assist in negotiations with the City with regard to financial assistance related to its potential relocation.  Sara Lee anticipates significantly higher build out costs for the move to Chicago over a 10 year period) when compared to remaining in its Downers Grove headquarters.  Sara Lee seeks assistance from the City of Chicago in the amount of $5 million-$6.5 million in Canal/Congress TIF funds to help defray some of its anticipated office build-out costs of $ 30 million. Should the City approve this request, Sara Lee (aka Meat Co) will move its headquarters to Chicago's West Loop area and house 500 employees at 400 S. Jefferson. In addition, MeatCo anticipates hiring up to an additional 150 employees within the five (5) year period after it occupies the premises (which are anticipated to be January, 2013).  All or a significant majority of the initial 500 employees are expected to be relocated directly from Sara Lee's current facility in Downers Grove... Without TIF, none ofthese employees would be relocated to the City.  In addition to the 500 employees Sara Lee intends to relocate to its new Chicago headquarters, Sara Lee may also create up to an additional 150 jobs within five years after it moves to the West Loop. The total number of new jobs located in the City would be 500-650.  IV. PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT TEAM  Development Entity: Sara Lee Corporation/MeatCo. Consultants: Colliers International, an international real estate and advisory firm; Bryan Cave LLP, an international law firm Architect: Gina Berndt! Perkins and Will  V. PROPOSED PROJECT  Sara Lee would enter into an office lease with Sterling Interests LLC as landlord of the 400 South Jefferson Building. Sara Lee would lease approximately 200,000-220,000 square feet ofcommercial office space on the first through fourth floors an initial period of 15 years (the ""MeatCo Space"").  In connection with its occupancy of the building, MeatCo would construct substantial tenant improvements necessary to permit MeatCo to take possession of the space in accordance with the terms of the lease. The project includes the build-out ofthe MeatCo Space and the use of the space as Headquarters for MeatCo. Initial occupancy ofthe MeatCo Space would be expected to occur by early 2013.  In addition to locating its Headquarters at the Property, the MeatCo would initially relocate 500 total full-time equivalent (FTE) employees of at the Headquarters. Within five-year period from completion ofthe office build-out, and Heed's issuance ofa Certificate ofCompletion, MeatCo may increase its total number ofemployees at the Headquarters by an additional 150FTE's and would be required to maintain a minimum of 500 FTE's through the term of the agreement.  MeatCo would create jobs at the Headquarters for a period of at 10 years from the issuance of the Certificate of Completion as summarized above.  Financial Assistance  The City of Chicago, through its Department of Housing and Economic Development, intends to enter into a Tax Increment Financing Redevelopment Agreement with Sara Lee/MeatCo for the purpose of providing an incentive to the company to locate its new headquarters in the City at 400 S. Jefferson Street and to maintain the headquarters at this location for a minimum of 10 years.  As part of the project the Developer would locate a minimum of 500 total full-time equivalent employees of Sara Lee/MeatCo at the new headquarters. The company anticipates creating a total of 650 new FTE's at the property during the life of the Agreement. The City intends to reimburse the Developer for a portion of its TIF-eligible costs in an amount not to exceed the lesser of $6,500,000 or 21.56% of the Total Project Costs, currently estimated to be $30,142,963.The City Funds will be provided, primarily, as a reimbursement for tenant improvementlbuild-out costs, which are expected to cost approximately $21,283,963 as well as other related TIF-e1igible costs. The City anticipates that T1F-eligible expenses will be reimbursed from existing increment, and/or bond funds, in the Canal/Congress Redevelopment Project Area Tax Increment Allocation Fund in the following manner:  A total of $5,000,000 of City Funds will be provided through five equal, annual payments on the basis of creating 500 jobs at 400 S. Jefferson, which Sara Lee/MeatCo must create and retain for a period often years from the issuance ofa Certificate as a condition of the payments(s). In addition, a total of $1,500,000 of City Funds will be provided through a single payment on, or about, the 6th Anniversary ofthe Certificate on the basis of creating 650 jobs at the Sara Lee/MeatCo Space.

PUBLIC BENEFITS  The proposed Project would provide substantial public benefits that contribute to the economic vitality and global competitiveness of Chicago and the Loop:  High-Value Jobs, Global Competitiveness and Regional Vitality The Project would relocate 500 high-value jobs from Downers Grove to the West Loop. These jobs have a collective payroll of approximately $54 million. Such high-wage, highly skilled professional jobs are critical to maintaining and enhancing Chicago's competitive position in the global economy.  Positive Image Impacts The substantial private investment in the City by such a major corporation as MeatCo is good news for Chicago in an otherwise challenging economic environment. This transaction reinforces the fact  that downtown Chicago is still the primary place where corporations do business in the region, especially firms such as MeatCo that value Chicago's strong international connections.  Spending Impacts from New Jobs Research by the International Council of Shopping Centers (lCSe) has found that downtown office workers spend an average of $6,274 per worker per year during the workday. Using this assumption, the 500 MeatCo workers relocated into Chicago will collectively spend approximately $3,137,000 per year on lunches, dinners, drinks, and shopping errands. This is new sales revenue that would be taxed by the City.  Permanent Jobs: The developer will locate a minimum of 500 total full- time equivalent employees of Sara Lee/MeatCo to this location. The company anticipates creating a total of 650 new FTE's at this site during the life of the Agreement.  Construction Jobs: approximately 120  Affirmative Action: MeatCo would comply with the requirements ofChicago's affirmative action ordinance, which requires contract participation of 24% by minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs) and 4% by woman-owned business enterprises (WBEs).  City Residency: MeatCo would comply with the requirements of Chicago's city residency ordinance, which requires that at least half of all construction-worker hours be filled by Chicago residents. MeatCo would also comply with the requirement that all construction jobs are paid the prevailing wage...  Environmental Features: Attain LEED Commerciallnterior certification.  VIII. COMMUNITY SUPPORT  Alderman Robert Fioretti has been informed of the project and is present today to support the project  IX. CONFORMANCE WITH REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLAN  The proposed project is located in the Canal/Congress Tax Increment Financing Redevelopment Project Area. The proposed project will satisfy the following goals of the area's redevelopment plan:  • Reduce or eliminate those conditions which qualify the Project area as a conservation  area. Strengthen the economic well-being of the Project Area by increasing taxable values.  •  • Create an environment which stimulates private investment in the upgrading and  expansion of existing businesses and construction of new business, residential and commercial facilities. Provide needed incentives to encourage a broad range of improvements in business retention, rehabilitation and new development.  •  X. CONDITIONS OF ASSISTANCE  If the proposed resolution is approved by the CDC, HED will negotiate a redevelopment agreement with the developer. The redevelopment agreement will incorporate the parameters of the proposed project as described in this staff report.  It is HED policy that no business will be conducted with a development entity whose any principal has outstanding municipal debts (such as unpaid parking tickets, unpaid water bills, unpaid business licenses, and others), is in arrears of child support payments, or who is a debtor in bankruptcy, a defendant in a legal action for deficient performance, a respondent in an administrative action for deficient performance, or a defendant in any criminal action.  Closing of the Redevelopment Agreement will not occur before the City Council has approved the redevelopment agreement.  XI. RECOMMENDATION  The Department of Housing and Economic Development has thoroughly reviewed the proposed project, the qualifications of the development team, the financial structure of the project, its need for public assistance, its public benefits, and the project's conformance with the redevelopment area plan, and HED recommends that the CDC recommend to the City Council the designation of Sara Lee IMeatCo as Developer for the development of a Corporate Headquarters at 400 S.

Since 2012, when the responsibility for  the certification of M/W/DBE firms and compliance with the City’s M/W/DBE program was  returned to DPS, we have pursued every opportunity to ensure that the City’s procurement  process remains fair, inclusive, diverse, and efficient.     In order to present a more accurate reflection of the impact of these firms, DPS is pleased  to announce that we can now report actual dollars spent with minority- and women-owned  businesses.  Many aldermen and the Inspector General’s Office have requested real-time  payment information reflecting actual dollars going to MBE and WBE firms.  Because of  advances  in  our  online  C2  System,  through  which  contractors  report  commitments,  payments and participation, we can now report payments as they occur instead of having  to wait until contract close-out.  DPS has conducted extensive training to introduce new  procedures, software upgrades and transparency initiatives.  Since 2012, more than 600  attendees have attended 14 of these DPS training programs.      Page 2 of 7      As discussed for many years, real-time payments provide more accurate information than  aspirational goals.  Payments are a far more valuable measure of the actual impact of the  M/WBE program; payments are what matter to vendors and their bottom line.  Accordingly,  we’ve  dedicated  resources  to  C2  so  we  can  document  reporting  and  payments  as  they  occur.   There are two methods for tracking and reporting payments: final contract close outs and  real-time payments taking place during the course of a contract’s life.   Since January 2013, projects with final contract values totaling $166.4 million have been  closed  out.    Of  the  total  payments  reported  paid  to  minority-  and  women-owned  businesses, 30 percent went to MBEs and 7 percent to WBEs (in 2012, 21 percent MBE  and 5 percent WBE).  The following numbers represent actual dollars reported as paid to  M/WBE  firms  on  those  contracts  that  have  been  closed  out.    African  American  firms  reported $19.9 million or 12 percent (12 percent in 2012); Hispanics reported $24.7 million  or 15 percent (8 percent in 2012); Asian Americans reported $4.8 million or 3 percent (1  percent in 2012) and Women (non-minority) reported $10.9 million or 7 percent (5 percent  in 2012).   An even more accurate measure of a moment in time is payments to date.  This is the first  year  in  which  we  have  enough  data  to  report  this  information.    These  payments,  made  against contracts between January 2013 and September 2013, totaled $504 million.  Of  the total payments made during this period, 29 percent went to MBEs and 8 percent went  to WBEs.  The following numbers represent actual dollars paid to M/WBE firms: African  Americans were paid $54.2 million or 11 percent; Hispanics were paid $63.1 million or 13  percent; Asian Americans were paid $32.7 million or 6 percent; and Women were paid $35  million or 7 percent.   Certification and Compliance   Since the responsibility for certification and  compliance  was  moved  to  DPS  in  2012,  we  have prioritized streamlining processes and creating efficiencies in these units.  We have  made significant strides towards achieving the 60 to 90 day processing time from receipt of  completed  applications  by  improved  technology,  additional  training  and  staffing  and  improved communications.      Page 3 of 7      Beginning  in  June  2013,  DPS  instituted  a  change  to  the  certified  vendors  No  Change  Affidavit  (“NCA”)  process.    Certified  firms  no  longer  receive  annual  certification  letters.   When a firm becomes certified (new applications or re-certifications) the certification letter  will  be  valid  for  five  years  from  the  effective  date  of  the  certification.    This  change  streamlined  the  process  for  vendors  and  created  efficiencies  within  the  department  and  has garnered very positive feedback from the vendor community.   Additionally, compliance is a pivotal component of DPS.  It includes a three-step process,  which begins with pre-award/goal setting, ongoing monitoring of the contract, and closing  the contract.  During the life of contracts, DPS monitors monthly payments to make sure  prime  contractors  are  meeting  their  minority-  and  women-owned  business  participation  goals.    We  also  check  weekly  to  determine  whether  payrolls  are  being  entered  into  the  online  system  and  perform  unannounced  site  visits  on  certain  construction  contracts.   Issues  are  addressed  promptly  and  efficiently.    Once  construction  contracts  reach  completion,  we  obtain  final  line  item  quantities  from  User  Departments.    Final  quantities  contain the final waivers of lien and the final numbers required to assess the contract.  At  this  point,  we  are  able  to  determine  actual  participation  percentages  and  payments  and  assess penalties if necessary.   Reciprocity   DPS is constantly seeking ways for all minority- and women-owned businesses to partake  in the contracting process.  To that end, beginning in January 2013, the City of Chicago  and  Cook  County  implemented  a  reciprocal  MBE/WBE  certification  program.   This  agreement allows potential M/WBE vendors to take advantage of both City and County bid  opportunities without filling out two different applications.    Procurement Modernization/eProcurement   DPS  has  also  been  hard  at  work  focusing  on  innovations  and  efficiencies  to  improve  operations and the vendor experience.  This year, DPS has made significant progress on  the  groundbreaking  eProcurement/Modernization  initiative.    This    program  will  increase  transparency  at  all  stages  of  the  procurement  process,  generate  cost  savings  from  significantly reduced procurement cycle-times, reduce overall cost of goods and services      Page 4 of 7      through strategic sourcing and enhanced vendor competition and create efficiencies and  reduction of paperwork between DPS and City User Departments.     This initiative has four phases.  The completed phases have increased bid transparency by  ensuring that: all winning and losing competitive non-construction bids are posted online;  all  of  the  solicitation  documents  for  bids  are  posted  online;  and  all  subcontractors,  including M/WBEs proposed by each bidder, winning or otherwise, are also posted along  with  the  bid  tabulation  on  the  DPS  web  site.    DPS  will  post  construction  contracts  and  RFPs in the near future.     The most revolutionary phase of the initiative, implementing an eProcurement application,  is  well  under  way.    Upcoming  innovations  and  improvements  include  the  electronic  submission  of  bids  and  RFPs;  ordering  via  electronic  catalogs;  strategic  sourcing;  electronic  submission  of  invoices  by  vendors;  vendor  self-service  inquiry  on  payments;  electronic routing and approval of the contract packages during the signature cycle; and  improved reporting and analytics.   In 2013, we have also made enhancements to existing programs.     Small Business Initiative   The  Small  Business  Initiative  is  a  program  that  creates  jobs  and  opportunities  in  our  neighborhoods.  It  provides  a  level  playing  field  for  small  businesses  to  compete  in  the  construction  realm,  an  area  in  which  larger  companies  are  often  at  an  advantage.  The  program  is  race  and  gender  neutral,  is  exclusive  to  small  businesses  and  is  limited  to  construction projects that are under a predetermined dollar amount.     This year, in response to feedback from the small business community, the program has  been divided into two tiers, SBI I and SBI II.  This tiered system establishes standards that  provide even greater opportunities for smaller businesses to compete for work.  The first  tier, SBI I, is for projects that are $3 million in total cost or less, and can be bid by firms that  do not exceed SBA size standards per NAICS code.  The second tier, SBI II, is for projects  that are $2 million in total cost or less, and can be bid on by firms that do not exceed one  half of the SBA size standards per NAICS code.  Since the program began in 2012, we      Page 5 of 7      have advertised 19 projects, and an additional three projects will be advertised before the  end of the year.   Project Area Resident Ordinance   In 2013, City Council approved an ordinance that requires contractors performing on City  construction contracts valued at $100,000.00 or more to utilize residents surrounding the  construction project area; at least 7.5 percent of all labor hours worked on the project site  must  be  performed  by  local  residents.    This  initiative  will  allow  people  in  communities  across  Chicago  to  benefit  not  only  from  the  construction  projects  and  infrastructure  improvements, but also from the jobs and economic impact of these projects.   Generating Revenue   In addition, DPS is also responsible for managing a revenue-generating unit that oversees  the online auctions for the City of Chicago.  In 2013, this program is on track to realize over  $3.2 million from auction proceeds and savings resulting from deferred disposal fees.   Communications & Outreach   Communication  and  outreach  help  to  keep  residents  informed  of  new  programs  and  innovations.  In the last year, DPS has participated in over 120 events and workshops to  provide  businesses  with  information  on  the  City’s  procurement  process  and  business  opportunities.    In January 2013, DPS hosted the first Construction Summit.  More than 20 Chicago, Cook  County and Illinois agencies participated to provide contracting opportunity information to a  large  number  of  firms.    More  than  300  people  representing  hundreds  of  construction  companies, suppliers, and manufacturers received information on hundreds of construction  projects with a total estimated bid value of over $500 million dollars.    In June 2013, we hosted a Vendor Fair in which all the City Departments, Sister Agencies,  and  Assist  Agencies  collaborated  to  give  small  businesses  information  on  upcoming  contract  opportunities.    Subject  matter  experts  in  all  disciplines  were  in  attendance,  providing an opportunity for potential bidders and businesses to ask questions and prepare  for future contract bids.        Page 6 of 7      DPS offers 13 different classes on procurement and certification related issues at no cost  to the public.  Through these classes, DPS shares knowledge on governmental contracting  policies  and  procedures  in  order  to  increase  the  existing  vendor  pool  and  maintain  transparency in contracting.  Each class is offered a minimum of four times per year.  In  addition  to  the  classes  that  are  held  at  City  Hall,  DPS  conducts  meetings  and  gives  educational  presentations  out  in  the  field.      DPS  will  continue  to  implement  outreach  programs throughout Chicago’s business community in an effort to increase awareness of  contracting opportunities for small, minority- and women-owned businesses and to provide  information on certification and contract compliance.    DPS continues to release the City’s Buying Plan, which outlines goods and services along  with subcontracting opportunities that the City will be advertising for bid over the following  18 months.  The Buying Plan is a great resource for firms looking to plan a bid, network or  seek joint venture opportunities.   DPS Alerts   DPS sends out weekly email alerts to inform vendors and the public of bid opportunities,  new programs, rules and regulations.  Over 100 DPS Alerts are sent out annually to over  8,000 active users.     Whether  evaluating  and  building  on  our  past  performance  to  strengthen  small,  minority-  and  women-owned  businesses,  implementing  industry  best  practices,  or  harnessing  cutting-edge technology to improve operations, transparency and the vendor experience,  DPS  will  continue  to  push  the  envelope  of  standards  in  the  public  procurement  sector.   Please be assured that we remain committed to providing competitive, fair and transparent  procurement services for the City of Chicago.   Respectfully Submitted,   Jamie L.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,559 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Kimball Avenue, from  W. Armitage Avenue to W. North Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Colón’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner    cc:   Alderman Rey Colón                   35th Ward    1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             Do you wonder what was happening in 1890?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                         CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                    KIMBALL AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing N. Kimball Avenue,  from W. Armitage Avenue to W. North Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed by early February 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Kimball Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE                                            CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1   ALDERMAN REY COLÓN   773- 365-3535   312-742-1021       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in early  February 2013. Restoration will follow in mid April 2013. We always hesitate to promise  specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere  in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Approval of Minutes: August 2017 minutes were approved.    Commissioner’s Update: Commissioner Morita reported the following:   DACA  Commissioner Morita continues to be disheartened by the cruel and unjust treatment of our young  undocumented Americans, our DREAMERS. This administration's decision to revoke the limited  protections they received under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals is unconscionable. The  City of Chicago remains committed to protecting immigrants, in particular dreamers. I am proud to  have the Chicago Board of Health endorse CDPH’s “All Are Welcome Here” campaign, which  communicates our commitment to provide access to health services for all Chicagoans regardless  of immigration status. We will continue to be informed and work together across departments to  prioritize and serve all residents with the greatest need, DREAMERS included.     Affordable Care Act  Just last week CDPH learned that Chicago hit another record in our ongoing efforts to increase  health  access  for  Chicago  residents.  Today,  only  9.6%  of  our  residents  do  not  have  health  insurance. This progress is a result of the Affordable Care Act and the hard work of so many local  groups  ensuring  residents  take  full  advantage  of  the  law.  On  Tuesday,  September  26th  Commissioner  Morita  will  be  in  DC  to  speak  with  congress  issues  related  to  infrastructure— human capital and systems with a focus on emergency preparedness, response, and recovery.    Salmonella Outbreak   CDPH  investigators  recently  identified  an  outbreak  of  salmonella,  linked  it  to  Best  BBQ  in  Morgan Park and confirmed 16 cases including  eight hospitalizations and one death. Testing of  suspected  food  items  demonstrated  Salmonella  on  cooked  rib  tips  and  multiple  food  handlers  tested  positive  for  the  disease.  The  restaurant  has  been  reopened  and  our  team  will  continue  to  work closely with owners to ensure that food handling and storage practices are used.     Preparedness Drill  This summer our emergency preparedness team responded to a situation where an inmate at Cook  County  Jail  made  potentially  credible  threats  related  to  bioterrorism.  Their  work  included  coordinating information sharing and planning between local, state and federal law enforcement  and  health  experts.  After  the  threat  was  systematically  evaluated,  it  was  determined  no  active  public  health  intervention  was  required.  However,  their  response  and  efficacy  in  coordinating  agencies demonstrates the value of CDPH’s standardized approach to potential health threats.    West Nile Virus  This  has  been  a  mild  WNV  season  requiring  limited  adulticide  spraying.  (South  Deering  and  Pullman). To date, two Chicago residents have been confirmed to have contracted West Nile virus  this  season.  As  the  mosquito  season  is  coming  to  an  end,  the  risk  of  human  West  Nile  virus  infection in the City of Chicago continues to decrease; however we are still encouraging residents  to take precautions against getting mosquito bites. Surveillance crews will continue to monitor and  test on a weekly basis throughout the rest of the month of September.          2       Chicago Board of Health   Meeting Summary: September 20th, 2017  DePaul Center, 333 South State Street   3   to  celebrate   local,  state,  federal  and  non-profit  partners   Flu Shot  On  September  25th  CDPH  will  launch  its  annual  campaign,  “Love  the  City,  Hate  the  Flu”  to  encourage residents to get their flu shot, including print and digital ads, and our Flu Clinics Finder.  We will host clinics in all 50 wards and city hall, including aldermanic offices and Chicago Police  Departments. This year we will launch a new partnership with the Chicago Parks which will offer  200 Park Points to residents who receive their vaccination.     Recovery Walk   On Saturday, September 16th Commissioner Morita and staff participated in CDPH’s 14th annual  Walk  for  Recovery,  we  are  still  finalizing  the  numbers  but  it  might  be  the  largest  one  to  date.  CDPH  collaborates  with  the  accomplishments  of  Chicago’s  substance  use  treatment  and  recovery  community.  The  event  consists of an array of guest speakers, a 3-mile walk, in Garfield Park and through surrounding  neighborhoods.  The  day  was  concluded  with  a  final  event,  Recovery  Olympics  which  includes  games, competition and activities in celebration of Chicago’s recovery community.     Getting to Zero Plan   Yesterday, Commissioner Morita joined partners from the AIDS Foundation of Chicago and the  Chicago  Black  Gay  Men’s  Caucus  to  formally  unveil  the  framework for  a  new  collaborative  initiative  with  CDPH,  The  Illinois  Department  of  Public  Health  and  10  local  community  organizations  and  hospitals  to  reach  zero  new  HIV  diagnoses  in  10  years.  Scientific  modeling  suggests  that  by  increasing  the  use  of  PrEP,  the  pill  that  if  taken  daily  can  reduce  the  risk  of  becoming  infected  with  HIV  by  more  than  90  percent  and  also  increasing  adherence  to  HIV  treatment for people living with the disease, HIV in Chicago will reach a point where it can no  longer sustain itself, or “functional zero.”      Helene Gayle   Commissioner  Morita  was  very  happy  announce  the  selection  of  longtime  social  sector  leader  Helene Gayle appointed President and CEO of Chicago Community Trust the Chicago Community  Trust.    Comments by the Board President: Dr. Lopez commented that current politics is like playing  with water – whatever progress you’ve made is washed out but we must persist to do the right  thing for the well-being the community.     Policy Update:  Jesse Lava provided the following policy updates:  ACA repeal  U.S.  Senators  are  again  seeking  to  repeal  the  Affordable  Care  Act.  This  time  their  deadline  is  September  30th  because  that’s  the  deadline  set  by  the  Senate  parliamentarian  for  using  budget  reconciliation, a process where only a majority vote is needed and a bill can’t be filibustered. (It’s  the end of the fiscal year.) The bill is known as Graham (SC) - Cassidy (LA). It would eliminate  the  individual  and  employer  mandate  as  well  as  the  medical  device  tax;  turn  Medicaid  and  the  exchanges into state block grants that are cut deeply over time; and allow states to change the rules  as  they  like,  including  eliminating  the  requirement  that  insurers  cover  people  with  preexisting  conditions. It may again come down to a single vote.                     ACA enrollment  Meanwhile, CDPH is  preparing for this  year’s open enrollment effort for the ACA. The Trump  administration has abridged it to a month and a half, from the previous three months. But we will   conduct vigorous outreach to enroll as many uninsured Chicagoans as possible. As Dr. Morita said,  Chicago’s uninsured rate is at a record low, and we will build on that progress.    Fly dumping  CDPH  and  the  Mayor  have  introduced  an  ordinance  to  raise  fines  on  fly  dumping,  when  companies leave massive amounts of waste on public or private property to avoid proper cleanup.  It  can  be  construction  debris  or  barrels  of  hazardous  material.  Fly  dumping  can  threaten  environmental health by attracting rats, creating a breeding ground for mosquitoes carrying West  Nile Virus, and polluting the land, air, and water. The City is also installing cameras in numerous  spots where fly dumping is common. The measure will reduce the burden on the City due to lower  cleanup costs and time spent going after violators.     Good Food Purchasing Policy   CDPH  and  the  Mayor  have  also  introduced  a  resolution  to  have  Chicago  adopt  the  Good  Food  Purchasing  Policy  to  ensure  city  departments’  procurement  of  food  promotes  nutrition  and  environmental sustainability, including a preference for locally grown food. DFSS, for instance,  purchases  a  significant  amount  of  food  for  clients.  CDPH  aims  to  foster  a  better  food  system  throughout the supply chain. Sister agencies such as CPS and the Park District are also moving in  this direction.    Town Halls  CDPH finished their series of town halls on healthy kids, using the Board’s feedback earlier in the  summer  to  revamp  our  presentation.  We  held  events  in  high-hardship  neighborhoods  including  West Pullman, Brighton Park, Eastside, and West Garfield Park. As you may recall, CDPH raised  issues including lead, paid parental leave, being a trauma-informed City, fast food meals marketed  to  children  and  an  HPV  vaccine  for  children.  CDPH  received  excellent  feedback  and  thoughts  from residents and are now analyzing them to help inform our work.    Pharma rep license  CDPH now has more than 1,000 drug reps licensed, which means we are successfully bringing  them  into  the  new  regulatory  apparatus  in  Chicago,  which  will  help  ensure  accountability  and  continuing education while freeing up revenue for opioid addiction treatment.

News & Updates  The 22nd Annual Infection Control Conference will be held on June 9th, 2017; registration and  agenda information coming soon.  As long as influenza viruses are circulating, all Chicagoans aged six months and older  are encouraged to get vaccinated.  Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availa- bility.  For those without a healthcare provider or whose healthcare providers do not have the influenza vaccine, a list of  City of Chicago Fast-Track Immunization Clinics1 is available on the City website and by calling 311.  To locate the clos- est City of Chicago clinic or retail pharmacy, go to www.chicagoflushots.org.                                                                                       What is the risk?   Currently, the risk of influenza infection continues to      decrease.

For the week of April 9-15, 2017, six influenza- associated ICU hospitalizations were reported (Figure  1).     Since October 2, 2016, 262 influenza-associated ICU  hospitalizations have been reported; 182 were positive  for influenza A (106 H3N2, 2 H1N1pdm09 and 74 un- known subtype [subtyping not attempted or not all sub- types tested]) and 80 were positive for influenza B.   The median age of reported cases is 62 years (range  of 1 month - 100 years).

CDPH receives data from several hospitals in Chicago  that provide emergent care, which report on a weekly  basis the total number of emergency department visits,  and of those visits, the number with influenza-like ill- ness (ILI) (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with cough or sore throat).  For the week of April 9-15, 2017, with 9 hospitals  reporting, 3.3% of emergency department visits were due to ILI (Figure 2).  ESSENCE is an electronic syndromic sur- veillance system that utilizes emergency department chief complaint data submitted daily by Chicago hospitals;  ILI ac- tivity is determined solely based on the patient’s chief complaint and does not take into account the entire medical rec- ord, as the ILI activity reported in Figure 2 does.     1 https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/clinical_health/immunizations_walk-inclinics.html     All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.

Percent of emergency department visits attributed to  influenza-like illness by hospital region based on chief complaint data  submitted to ESSENCE, Chicago, by week, for the current season  (2016-2017) and previous three seasons, October-May.      Currently, all Chicago hospitals submit data to ES- SENCE, covering every emergency department visit in  the city.  For the week of April 9-15, 2017, 1.6% of all  emergency department visits were due to ILI;  Northside hospitals had slightly higher ILI at 1.9%,  Southside hospitals at 1.7% and Westside hospitals  had slightly lower ILI at 1.3% (Figure 3).   Several outpatient clinics throughout Chicago partici- pate in CDC’s Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Net- work (ILINet) by reporting on the number of patients  with ILI seen weekly.  For the week of April 9-15,  2017, with 22 facilities reporting, 3.7% of outpatient  visits were due to influenza-like illness (Figure 4).     Which influenza strains are circulating?                                                                                                                                 Data on influenza virus test results are reported by  Chicago laboratories performing influenza RT-PCR.  For the week of April 9-15, 2017, with 5 laboratories  reporting, 60 of the 489 (12.3%) specimens tested for  influenza were positive (25 A (H3N2), 0 A  (H1N1pdm09), 4 A [unknown subtype], and 31 influen- za B).   Figure 4. Percent of medically-attended outpatient visits attributed  to influenza-like illness as reported by ILINet facilities, Chicago, by  week, for the current season (2016-2017) and previous three  seasons, October-May.    Since October 2, 2016, 1,967 of 18,565 (10.6%) spec- imens tested for influenza have been positive; 1,231  typed as influenza A (1,049 H3N2, 21 H1N1pdm09,  and 161 unknown subtype [subtyping not attempted or  not all subtypes tested]) and 736 typed as influenza B  (Figure 5).  So far this season, influenza B viruses  have co-circulated with influenza A more frequently  than in previous influenza seasons where an increase  in influenza B usually occurs towards the end of the  season (Figure 6).    Figure 6.  Percent of specimens testing positive (by RT-PCR)  for influenza B as reported by local laboratories serving  Chicago hospitals, for the current season (2016-2017) and  previous three seasons, October-May.   Where can I get more information?                         The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  FluView2 report provides national updates and trends  related to the intensity of influenza activity across the  United States, as well as detailed information on anti- viral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics.  Updates specific to Illinois3 and Suburban Cook  County4 are also available online.  Current and ar- chived issues of the Chicago Flu Update can be  found on the CDPH website section Current Flu Situ- ation in Chicago5.                             Figure 5.

On December 2, 2014, the Chicago City Council approved Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s ordinance establishing  a minimum wage of $13 per hour in Chicago by 2019, a 45 percent increase over the current applicable  minimum wage.  The minimum wage increases incrementally each year beginning on July 1, 2015.       All employers operating within the city are subject to the new minimum wage. What is the minimum wage increase schedule?     The minimum wage increase will be phased in on an annual basis every July 1st from 2015 – 2019 according  to the schedule below.  Beginning in 2020 and every year thereafter, the minimum wage increase will be  tied to the rate of inflation, but not to exceed 2.5 percent, and there will be no increase to the minimum  wage when the unemployment rate in Chicago in the previous year was equal to or greater than 8.5  percent.  Effective Date July 01, 2017 July 01, 2018 July 01, 2019 July 01, 2020  Non-Tipped Employees  Tipped Employees *  $11.00 $12.00 $13.00   $6.10  Amount to be  determined and  announced yearly   on or before June 1st.   *Under both state law and the ordinance, if an employee’s wages plus tips do not equal at least the number of hours  worked times the applicable minimum wage per week, his or her employer must make up the difference.  Who is covered under the ordinance? •  Any employee who works at least two hours while physically present in the city within a two-week period  qualifies  for  the  minimum  wage  required  by  the  ordinance.  This  includes  domestic  employees,  day  laborers, and home health care workers.  A union may waive its members’ rights to receive the minimum  wage as part of a collective bargaining agreement.    •  Employees  are  not  required  to  provide,  and  the  City  will  not  request,  information  regarding  the   immigration status of any person filing a complaint.  What can I do if I believe I am owed wages by my employer? •  You may file a complaint against your employer with the City of Chicago if you believe you have  been  paid less than the required minimum wage.  Employees may file a claim with the City of Chicago by  calling 311 or submitting a fully completed complaint affidavit.  If BACP successfully prosecutes your  complaint, you are entitled to full payment of back wages.  In addition, employers are potentially liable  to  the  City  for  fines  between  $500  -$1,000  per  violation,  as  well  as  business  license  suspension  or  revocation.  •  BACP does not act as any employee’s private attorney. An employee has the right to file a private civil  action in the Cook County Circuit Court against his or her employer if the employee was paid less than  the minimum wage required by law and such employee may be able to recover three times the amount  of underpayment plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.  •  Complaints must be filed within 1 year after the wages were due.   @ChicagoBACPCityofChicago.org/BACPDepartment of Business Affairs and Consumer ProtectionCity Hall, 121 North LaSalle Street, Rm 805 Chicago, IL 60602
