This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,630 feet of 8-inch water main in E. 69th Street, from S. South  Chicago Avenue to S. Cottage Grove Avenue and S. Langley Avenue, from E. 67th Street to E.  69th Street. The old pipe dates back to 1891, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Cochran’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner      cc:   Alderman Willie Cochran                   20th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         Do you wonder what was happening in 1891?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                  Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap      and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.                        69TH ST. & LANGLEY AVE. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,630 feet of 8-inch  water main in E. 69th Street, from S. South Chicago Avenue to S. Cottage Grove Avenue and S.  Langley Avenue, from E. 67th Street to E. 69th Street.    Reason:  The old main consists of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further the old  pipe dates back to 1891 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in mid December 2014. In addition, following the completion of the water main  work, a new sewer main will be installed. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on E. 69th Street and S. Langley Avenue outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                    ALDERMAN WILLIE COCHRAN   773-955-5610                              FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in mid  December 2014. In addition, following the completion of the water main work, a new sewer  main will be installed. Restoration will follow in mid April 2015. We always hesitate to promise  specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere  in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

You  stated  that your niece,  Ms.  Blue,  is  an  attorney  who  has  a  demonstrated  commitment  to  public  service  and  experience  in  development matters,  particularly  issues  relating  to  [facilities].  You  asked  whether,  under the City's ethics rules,  you  would  be  prohibited  from  hiring  Ms.  Blue as  a  member of your personal,  aldermanic  staff. I advised  you  that  the  City's  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  you  from  doing  so.  The  purpose  of this  letter  is  to  confirm that advice and to set forth the legal basis for it.   Section  2-156-130(a)  of  the  Ordinance  (""Employment  of  Relatives  or  Domestic  Partners"") provides,  in relevant part:   No official or employee shall employ or advocate for employment,  in  any  City  agency  in  which  said  official  or employee  serves  or over which  he  exercises  authority,  supervision,  or  control,  any  person  (i)  who  is  a  relative  or  domestic  partner  of  said  official  or  employee .. . provided  that  the  prohibition  in  (i)  applies  to  City  Council  Committee  staff  but not to  personal staff of an alderman.  (emphasis added).   Accordingly,  under  the  exception  explicitly  set  forth  in  Section  2-156-130(a)  of  the  Ordinance,  you  are  not prohibited from  hiring  your niece,  Ms.  Blue,  as  a member of your  personal,  aldermanic staff.   Board  staff's  conclusion  and  advice  are  based  solely  on  the  application  of  the  City's  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance to  the  facts summarized  in  this  letter.  If these  facts  are  incorrect  or  incomplete,  please  notify  our office  immediately,  as  any  change  may  alter  our conclusion.   Our office appreciates your bringing this question to  us,  and  your interest in  ensuring that  your  conduct  conforms  to  the  standards  embodied  in  the  City's  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance.

Sedgwick, Suite 400, Chicago, IL 60654      Phone 312/744-4111, Fax 312/744-1081, TTY 312/744-1088   www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations           IS YOUR BUSINESS ACCESSIBLE?  to wheelchair users & others with disabilities   Chicago’s  Human  Rights  Ordinance  requires  every  business  that  serves  the  general public to make its services, products, and facilities  accessible on an equal  basis  to  people  who  use  wheelchairs  due  to  disability,  to  the  extent  possible  without undue hardship.     o  Existing and new businesses are covered.  No business is “grandfathered.”   o  Compliance with the  Building Code is  not  enough.  The Department of  Buildings does not   inspect for compliance with the Human Rights Ordinance.     o  You  can  provide  less  than  full  wheelchair  access  if  you  can  prove  undue  hardship  by   objective evidence; e.g., you can prove physical impossibility and/or prohibitive cost.       o  Even  if  it  is  an  undue  hardship  to  make  structural  changes,  you  must  provide  reasonable   accommodations for wheelchair users to the extent possible without undue hardship.   o  Examples of reasonable accommodations include a portable ramp, a bell or buzzer to call for  assistance,  curb  service,  telephone  or  internet  service,  arrangements  with  a  neighboring  business to use their accessible restroom, and staff training.     o  You may need to  place  signage  at  your entrances and notices in  your advertising to  inform   people of any limited accessibility and your alternative arrangements.   o  Carrying or lifting a wheelchair user is not a permitted accommodation.   o  Federal and state discrimination laws have similar accessibility requirements.      Violations of the Human Rights Ordinance are punishable by    -  Fines up to $1,000 per incident, paid to the City of Chicago.   -  Damages and attorney’s fees, paid to the complaining party.   -  An injunction ordering you to take specific actions to meet ordinance requirements.   A wheelchair user who claims you did not provide full or reasonable access to your business may  file  a  disability  discrimination  complaint  against  you  at  the  Commission  on  Human  Relations.   The Commission may also initiate a complaint.  The Commission investigates and rules on each  discrimination  complaint  through  a  neutral  process  which  gives  you  the  opportunity  to  present  evidence and legal arguments to support your position.      See the back of this flyer for selected ordinance and regulation provisions.  More information about the  Commission  on  Human  Relations  and  Chicago’s  discrimination  ordinances  is  available  at  www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations.   SELECTED LEGAL PROVISIONS   Accessibility of Public Accommodations to People with Disabilities     Section 2-160-020(j), Chicago Municipal Code (Human Rights Ordinance)  Definition of a Public Accommodation  “Public accommodation” means a place, business establishment or agency that sells, leases, provides or offers any  product, facility or service to the general public, regardless of ownership or operation (i) by a public body or agency;  (ii) for or without regard to profit; or (iii) for a fee or not for a fee….    Section 2-160-070, Chicago Municipal Code (Human Rights Ordinance)  Discriminatory practices—Public Accommodations  No  person  that  owns,  leases,  rents,  operates,  manages  or  in  any  manner  controls  a  public  accommodation  shall  withhold,  deny,  curtail,  limit  or  discriminate  concerning  the  full  use  of  such  public  accommodation  by  any  individual because of the individual’s…disability.    CCHR Reg. 520.105  Accommodation of Persons with Disabilities  No person who owns, leases, rents, operates, manages or in any manner controls a public accommodation shall fail  to fully accommodate a person with a disability unless such person can prove that the facilities or services cannot be  made fully accessible without undue hardship.  In such a case, the owner, lessor, renter, operator, manager or other  person  in  control  must  reasonably  accommodate  persons  with  disabilities  unless  such  person  in  control  can  prove  that he or she cannot reasonably accommodate the person with a disability without undue hardship.    CCHR Reg. 520.120  Definition of “Reasonable Accommodation”  “Reasonable  Accommodation”…means,  but  is  not  limited  to,  accommodations  (physical  changes  or  changes  in  rules, policies, practices or procedures) which provide persons with a disability access to the same services, in the  same manner as are provided to persons without a disability.    CCHR Reg. 520.130  Definition of “Undue Hardship”  “[U]ndue hardship will be proven if the financial costs or administrative changes that are demonstrably attributable  to the accommodation of the  needs of persons  with disabilities  would be prohibitively expensive or  would  unduly  affect the nature of the public accommodation.    (a)  There  must  be  objective  evidence  of  financial  costs,  administrative  changes,  or  projected  costs  or  changes   which would result from accommodating the needs of persons with disabilities.   (b)  Factors to be considered in determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship include,   but are not limited to:  (1)  the nature and cost of the accommodation;  (2)  the  overall  financial  resources  of  the  public  accommodation,  including  resources  of  any  parent   organization;   (3)  the effect on expenses and resources, or the impact otherwise of such accommodation upon the operation of   the public accommodation; and    (4)  the type of operation or operations of the public accommodation.   (c)  The preference of other persons making use of the public accommodation does not constitute undue hardship    CCHR Reg. 540  Standards  [W]henever physical accommodations are required to be made pursuant to the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance to  fully or reasonably accommodate a person with a disability, and where the Illinois Environmental Barriers Act (410  ILCS 25/1 et seq.) is also applicable, such changes shall be made in accordance with the Illinois Accessibility Code,  71 Illinois Administrative Code, Ch. 1, subchapter b: Accessibility Standards (“IAC Standards”).  With respect to all  other physical accommodations required to be  made pursuant to the  Chicago Human Rights Ordinance  to fully or  reasonably  accommodate  a  person  with  a  disability,  the  Commission  shall  refer  to  the  Illinois  Accessibility  Code  and the American National Standards Institute standards for persons with disabilities….[T]he Commission does not  adopt the Illinois Environmental Barriers Act or any other substantive law for purposes of determining whether there  has  been  a  violation  of  the  Human  Rights  Ordinance.    However,  the  Commission  does  look  to  the  Illinois  Accessibility  Code  and  the  American  National  Standards  Institute  Standards…to  determine  whether  the  proposed  accommodations are adequate and appropriate.

Ongoing Investigative Record   Lobbyists-Regulation and Enforcement   To date, 160 lobbyists have completed the 2014-2015 lobbyist program. Their  deadline is June 30.   To date, 4,809 employees have completed the 2015 mandatory education program.  Their deadline is December 31, 2015.     We continue to post on the Board’s website the ongoing investigative record,  showing the status of every completed investigative report brought to the Board by  both inspectors general since January 1, 2012, and the status of every petition to  commence an investigation brought by the Legislative Inspector General to the  Board.  The record is consistent with the confidentiality provisions of the Ordinance.     Currently, there are 559 lobbyists registered for 2015, and the agency has collected  $275,401 in lobbyists’ registration fees. The regular quarterly reporting period  ended on March 31; quarterly activity reports were due April 20th.  To date, 461  lobbyists have filed their reports (5 lobbyists are new registrants and need not file  activity reports this quarter).  On April 1, the ELF system sent out reminder notices  to all registered lobbyists of this deadline.  On or around April 23, we will send  notice via US mail to all lobbyists who failed to file by the deadline; they have 10  business days from that date to file without being subject to fines.  We will then send  all non-compliant lobbyists a “due process letter,” explaining that they are in  violation of the Ordinance and subject to fines of $1,000 per day until they file.     To date, 1,903 employees and officials have filed their Statements of Financial  Interests. Updated lists of filers were sent to departmental and aldermanic ethics  liaisons on April 1, and will be again on May 1 and May 15.  The filing deadline is  May 31.    Advisory Opinions    Since the March 2015 meeting, the agency issued 268 confidential informal advisory  opinions (in addition to those formal opinions issued or approved by the Board).    •  The leading categories in this period (in descending order) were travel,  lobbying, post-employment, campaign financing, and prohibited conduct.       2015 Statements of Financial Interests      Open Session Minutes  April 22, 2015  Page 3      I.     Freedom of Information Act    •  51% of these were from City employees in administrative or management  positions, 15% from non-administrative or managerial employees, 20% from  lobbyists, 4% from City vendors or other businesses, 5% from department  heads, 4% from City elected officials (or their personal aides calling on their  behalf), and the remainder from City appointed officials, members of the public,  the  media,  and other government agencies.   •  55 % came via email; 42 % via telephone; the remainder via walk-ins.    •  Employees or officials from every City department (including the City Council)  are represented, with the most requested, in descending order, coming from  employees or officials in: City Council, Office of the Mayor, Police, Chicago Public  Library, Public Health, Fire, and Inspector General or Legislative Inspector  General.   Staff continues to work with the Department of Innovation & Technology on a “beta”  version of a secure, searchable database for all such informal advisory opinions.   This will enable Board staff to receive instantaneous reports of opinions issued by  topic, department, title, date, etc.     Since the last regularly scheduled Board meeting, the office has received 1 new  request under the Freedom of Information Act. The request was for 1 statement of  financial interests to which this agency responded with the redacted record. (Item  No. 5 reported upon at the last meeting was then still “open,” but, thereafter, the  Board sent a response to the requestor, providing links to online lobbyist filings and  an opportunity to view the one paper record, which record the requestor reviewed,  making no copies of pages therein.)       Case No. 12031.OLIG [2012OLIG0009]   The Board VOTED 6-0 to approve the form and content of the Settlement Agreement for this  matter, and directed the Executive Director to sign it and send it to the alderman’s counsel  for execution by the alderman and return for final execution by the Board’s Chair.   None.     The Board VOTED 6-0 to adjourn into Executive Session at 3:11 p.m. under 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(1) to  discuss the appointment, employment, compensation, discipline, performance, or dismissal of  specific employees of the public body or legal counsel for the public body, including hearing  testimony on a complaint lodged against an employee of the public body or against legal counsel for  the public body to determine its validity.

APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE SESSION MINUTES IN OPEN SESSION   The Board approved the Executive Session minutes of the March 18, 2015 meeting by  a VOTE of 6-0.   Query and Consult Summary    1.  Case No. 15020.CNS, Relatives   An employee sought advice from Board staff regarding the employee’s  signature on two documents pertaining to construction being performed in the  City by the employee’s spouse’s employer. As part of a matter-of-course signing  process of many documents, the employee had signed two documents,  including a contract with the City regarding a parcel of City property  comprising less than 1% of the area covered by the construction. The City’s  decisions to approve the project and enter into the relevant contracts with the  spouse’s employer were made before the employee began City service, and  negotiations between the parties were held without any involvement by the  employee. The employee also asked about and Board provided a method to  ensure that the employee would be properly recused from future matters  involving the spouse’s employer.    The Board considered the matter under §2-156-070(b) of the Ordinance to  determine whether the conduct involves a minor violation of §2-156-130(b) of  the Ordinance (which prohibits City employees from exercising contract  management authority with respect to City contracts with persons who employ  their relatives). The Board VOTED 6-0 to determine that the employee’s action  constituted a minor violation and directed staff to send the employee a  confidential letter of admonition.

Case No. 13046.OLIG [2013OLIG0026]   Pursuant to §2-156-385 of the Municipal Code, and Board Rules 4.1.B and C, the  Board of Ethics met with the alderman who is the subject in this matter and his  attorney on April 22, 2015, during its regularly scheduled meeting.  The Board  considered the entire record before it, including all materials presented to this  agency by the Legislative Inspector General, as well as the alderman’s written  and oral responses to those materials and to questions posed to him by Board  staff and members.  After that consideration, and deliberation thereon, the  Board VOTED 6-0, that the alderman’s actions did not constitute a violation of  any of the provisions of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance, and, accordingly,  determined to take no action in the matter and dismissed the case.   3.  Case No. 13039.OLIG [2013OLIG0027]   Pursuant to §2-156-385 of the Municipal Code, and Board Rules 4.1.B and C, the  Board of Ethics met with the attorney for the alderman who is the subject in  this matter on April 22, 2015, during its regularly scheduled meeting. The  subject alderman did not attend.  In order to enable the Board and staff to more  fully consider the materials and responses provided by the alderman’s  attorney, the Board deferred its vote on whether to sustain its original finding  of probable cause in this matter until its next regularly scheduled meeting.   4.  Case No. 12052.OLIG [2012OLIG0003]   The Board VOTED 6-0 to grant the subject alderman’s request for a  continuance of the §2-156-385(3) meeting between it and the  alderman until  the next scheduled Board meeting,  on May 27, 2015.      Meeting Pursuant to §2-156-385 on Probable Cause   5.  Case No. 141284.IG   Pursuant to §2-156-385 of the Municipal Code, and Board Rules 4.1B and C, the  Board of Ethics met with the subject and his attorney.  The matter involved §2- 156-100(b) of the Ordinance. The Board addressed whether a former City  employee’s assistance to his employer after he left City service (provided in  2008 and 2010) violated that section of the Ordinance. After that consideration  and deliberation on the entire factual record before it, the Board VOTED, 5-0  (one member recused), that the former employee’s actions did not constitute a  violation of any of the provisions of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance, and,  accordingly, determined to take no action in the matter and dismissed the case.      In Executive Session, there was an announcement that Board member Julia Nowicki  was resigning her membership on the Board effective at the adjournment of the   Office of Inspector General    C.   III.   OTHER BUSINESS     meeting.  She thanked all the Board members and staff for their service, and then all  the Board members and staff thanked her for her services and wished her well.

Climate change threatens human health, including    mental health, and access to clean air, safe drinking  water, nutritious food, and shelter. Everyone is affected  by climate change at some point in their lives. Some  people are more affected by climate change than  others because of factors like where they live; their age,  health, income, and occupation; and how they go  about their day-to-day life.   People with existing medical conditions are at  increased risk for illness and death from climate  change-related impacts on health, including changing    exposures to extreme heat, extreme weather events,  and poor air quality. Existing medical conditions can  make individuals more sensitive to these exposures,  increasing the potential for health impacts and    worsening symptoms. For example, individuals with    respiratory conditions are more likely to be negatively  affected by exposure to poor air quality than those  without these conditions. In addition, some underlying    health conditions can make it difficult for a person to  limit their exposure or adapt to risks. For example,  individuals with Alzheimer’s disease may have difficulty  responding to and evacuating during an extreme    weather event. Certain medications may also impair  the body’s ability to regulate temperature or maintain  fluid or electrolyte balances. The number of people  with common chronic medical conditions (such as  cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and     respiratory    diseases  including asthma) is expected to  increase over the coming decades.  This means more people will be at  risk of medical complications from  climate change-related exposures.     What is climate change and why does it   matter for health?    We’ve all heard of it, but what exactly is climate change?  Greenhouse gases act like a blanket around Earth,  trapping energy in the atmosphere. Human activities,  especially burning fossil fuels for energy, increase the  amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and  cause the climate to warm. Climate is the typical or  average weather for an area. Climate change is any  change in average weather that lasts for a long period of  time, like warming temperatures. Climate change affects  the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we  drink. It also leads to extreme weather events, like  flooding, droughts, and wildfires. All of these impacts  affect human health.   People with chronic medical conditions and their  families or caregivers can start taking steps now to  protect themselves against the negative impacts of  climate change. Community members can also take part  in local decision-making, especially emergency and  urban planning. Discussions like these raise awareness  and can help communities address the needs of all  residents.   If you have the following illnesses then you  should be aware that...   Heart Disease. Drugs used to treat heart diseases,  such as diuretics and beta-blockers, can make  people with heart disease more sensitive to heat  stress.   Diabetes. Diabetes increases sensitivity to heat  stress. Extreme weather events can also present  challenges for diabetics because these events can  limit access to healthcare, medicine, and food  needed to stay healthy.      Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary  Disease (COPD). Patients with asthma and COPD  are more sensitive than the general population to  changes in outdoor air quality made worse by  climate change. These lung conditions can be  aggravated by smoke from more frequent and  longer-lasting wildfires, longer pollen seasons, and  more ground-level ozone (a component of smog).      Alzheimer’s Disease. Alzheimer’s disease can  impair judgment and responses in a crisis  situation, such as an extreme weather event,  which can place people at greater risk.   Mental Illness. Some medications for certain  mental illnesses can increase sensitivity to heat  stress. Extreme weather events may also disrupt  communication lines and social support networks  that people with mental illnesses need to stay  healthy.

The  Green Exchange is fully permitted and work is expected to  re-start in 2010.     PD 1094   Phase 1 assessment was performed.  No recognized  environmental conditions were identified.       III. BACKGROUND    In early 2010, Baum Development, owners of the Green Exchange, began tenant negotiations  with Coyote Logistics, LLC to locate their corporate headquarters into the Green Exchange from  two facilities outside the city of Chicago and become the anchor tenant in the development.    In  April of 2010, the Department of Community Development (DCD) met with representatives of  Coyote Logistics to discuss financial incentives that would attract their company to Chicago from  an alternative location in Alpharetta, Georgia.  In late May of 2010, Coyote submitted an  application for TIF assistance to DCD.     The Green Exchange is a four-story landmark building that formerly housed the Frederick  Cooper Lamp Company until they went out of business in 2004.   It is a $56,000,000 commercial  real estate development designed to bring together a mix of businesses focused on environmental  sustainability.  The Green Exchange was presented to and approved by the CDC in December of  2009 and authorized by the City Council on May 12, 2010.  Specifically, a TIF deal was executed  that designated Gx Chicago, LLC the developer of the property and authorized the developer to  receive a $15 million HUD 108 Loan Guarantee that would be repaid with $10 million in TIF and  the remaining $5 million repaid with project revenues.  The request for TIF assistance was the  direct result of the project's $35 million construction loan being reduced to $20 million by the         lender.      The project is located in the 1st Ward, within the Addison South TIF and is fully permitted.  It is  pre-certified as a LEED Gold redevelopment by the U.S Green Building Council and Baum is  committed to pursuing LEED Platinum.  The building has a total of approximately 227,450  square feet of space for lease.  To date, there are 24 leases in place that will occupy 92,000 square  feet. With the inclusion of Coyote Logistics as anchor tenant in the Green Exchange, the building  will become 69% occupied and the total amount of space leased will rise to 156,656 square feet.       IV. PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT TEAM    Development Entity:  Coyote Logistics, LLC is a global third-party logistics (“3PL”)  company with a network of offices around the world.  Coyote uses proprietary software and  transportation technology tools to create truckload, intermodal, “less than truckload”  shipment, ocean, and air-based solutions for the demands of today’s challenging shipping  supply chains - based on client needs and transportation provider capacity. They do not  maintain a transportation fleet or operate a warehouse and/or distribution center.  Founded  in 2006 and incorporated in Delaware, Coyote is currently the fastest growing 3PL  company.  Its growth is due both to organic expansion and multiple mergers and  acquisitions, including the recent merger of General Freight Services (“GFS”). GFS was a  competitor based in Alpharetta, Georgia.     Coyote Logistics believes America’s producers of goods approach their supply chains in a  vacuum.  One distributor’s truck passes another moving empty in the same lane but in the  opposite direction, wasting money and harming our fragile ecology.  Coyote helps curb this  waste by overlaying their customers’ supply chains.  For example, they load one customer’s beer  shipment in another customer’s soft drink truck instead of that truck going home empty.  Or a big  box retailer truck might haul toothpaste on its return trips.  Coyote makes these matches happen  hundreds of times every day.  Every time this happens, two of their customers are able to cut  down on carbon emissions while saving money on shipping costs.  They believe their concept is  ""saving green while being green"".     As a result of the GFS merger, Coyote now operates two headquarters—Coyote’s  headquarter campus in Lake Forest, Illinois with 140 employees, and the GFS headquarters  in Alpharetta, Georgia, an international logistics hub, with 75 employees.  In order to  consolidate these two facilities, and in order to accommodate future growth, Coyote desires  to expand its headquarters operation and eliminate the inefficiencies related to operating in  two locations in two states.  To achieve this, Coyote will combine their headquarter  operations into a single facility within the Green Exchange even though Coyote is still  contractually obligated to lease its current office space in Alpharetta, Georgia until 2015.           Consultants: Partners by DESIGN, Inc. is the architect for the project.  They have extensive and  award-winning experience throughout Chicago in several business types including Corporate,  Insurance, Technology, Advertising/Public Relations, Healthcare, Financial/Banking, Law, Non- Profit and Retail.  Some of their works include CDW Computer Centers Inc., Northwestern  Memorial Hospital, Applegate Thorne-Thompson, Northern Trust, Maryville Academy,  Mercedes Benz of Chicago and many more.  A full list of projects can be found within this  report.  MB Real Estate work with Coyote in selecting a general contractor and will oversee the  build out of the Coyote space        V. PROPOSED PROJECT    DCD will enter into a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Redevelopment Agreement (RDA) with  Coyote Logistics, LLC for the purpose of providing an incentive to Coyote Logistics to relocate  their corporate headquarters in the City of Chicago and within the Green Exchange for a  minimum period of 10 years.  Coyote will lease and occupy approximately 64,656 square feet of  space on the third floor of the building.   In addition to locating their headquarters in the Green  Exchange, Coyote would initially relocate/retain 140 full-time employees (FTE's) from Lake  Forest, Illinois to their headquarters facility at the Green Exchange. During the first two years of  occupancy, Coyote will also create 160 new jobs at the Green Exchange - approximately 80 in  year one and 80 in year two. As a result, Coyote will increase their total number of FTE’s at the  headquarters to 300.  The lease will have an initial term of 10 years and 10 months commencing  on or about April 1, 2011 with occupancy no later then June 30, 2011. Coyote will also have the  right to expand into approximately 40,000 square feet of additional space during the term of the  lease.  In connection with its occupancy of the space, Coyote will construct substantial tenant  improvements necessary to permit the company to take possession of the space in accordance  with the terms of the lease.  In return, the City intends to reimburse Coyote for a portion of their  TIF-eligible improvements in an amount not to exceed the lesser of $2,000,000 or 30.1% of the  total project costs, currently estimated to be $6,649,745.        By moving into the Green Exchange, Coyote will not only bring a high-tech, growing business  with a high-talent employee pool to an industrial neighborhood, but will also jump start the  completion and occupation of the Green Exchange.  Most of Coyote’s employees are college- educated professionals.  The newly recruited employees and employees transferring from the  Lake Forest and Georgia offices may decide to move into the City of Chicago, increasing nearby  property values and supporting neighborhood businesses.  Currently, 66 employees working in  Lake Forest live in the city of Chicago.    Environmental Features: The Green Exchange is pre-certified to achieve LEED Gold  Certification by the U.S Green Building Council and Baum believes the building will qualify for            LEED Platinum.  Under either standard, at 275,884 square feet, the Green Exchange would  become the largest green business community in the country and the first LEED Platinum  industrial redevelopment in the City of Chicago.  Sustainable features include a 15,000 square  foot green roof with 90 solar thermal panels that will supply the domestic hot water for the  building, a 41,000 gallon storm water management system, and a state of the art sustainable  escalator that uses 30% less energy than standard models.  Other features include excellent water  conservation by using 37.5% less potable water than a comparable building using traditional  energy systems and using LED lighting throughout the building.        VI. FINANCIAL STRUCTURE    The City, through the Department of Community Development, intends to provide the Developer  with TIF assistance in an amount not to exceed the lesser of $2,000,000 or 30.1% of the Total  Project Costs, estimated to be $6,649,745.  This assistance equates to $6,667 per job.  The TIF- eligible expenses will be reimbursed from existing increment, and/or bond funds, in the Addison  South Redevelopment Project Area Tax Increment Allocation Fund. The assistance, a total of   $2,000,000, will be provided through the issuance of a Taxable Developer Note on the basis of  retaining the relocated and created jobs at the Coyote Space according to job requirements. The  Taxable Note will be subordinate to any existing obligations within the Addison South TIF.  Coyote will be required to maintain the jobs for a minimum period of ten (10) years from the  issuance of a Certificate of Completion for the project.    The State of Illinois, Department of Commerce & Economic Opportunity (DCEO) has already  committed $75,000 in job training dollars, EDGE Tax Credits worth $2.4 million, and $250/$500  training reimbursement dollars per each existing/new full-time job created.  The value of the   EDGE Tax Credits closes the financial gap between the costs of doing business in Illinois vs.  Georgia.  Ultimately, the Illinois EDGE Tax Credit is essential to Coyote’s decision to relocate  and expand its' headquarter operations within Illinois.  Without it, Coyote would be inclined to  undertake the project in Georgia, where it already has the requisite space and would enjoy a  lower cost of doing business.  The State of Georgia and the City of Alpharetta have indicated  their firm interest in Coyote’s relocation outside of Illinois.    There are several factors that DCD considered in underwriting Coyote's request for TIF  assistance.   In turn, due to the inefficiencies created by maintaining two headquarter operations,  Coyote had to weigh the costs and benefits of (1) maintaining and expanding its headquarters in  Illinois or (2) relocating its operations to Alpharetta, Georgia where they would be adjacent to  their competitors and conveniently situated near their logistics partners.  Additionally, Coyote  was obligated to lease its current office space in Alpharetta, Georgia until 2015 making the  benefits of staying in Georgia  appear more attractive than the cost of relocating to Chicago.   Another site selection criteria for the new Coyote headquarters was based on a cost benefit  analysis of each location offset by the incentives offered by each jurisdiction.  Coyote indicated         that the cost of doing business in Illinois was substantially higher than in Georgia because the  recent acquisition of GFS in Alpharetta, Georgia allowed Coyote to locate to a facility that had  35,000 feet of move-in ready office space that was leased until 2015.       Additionally, and particularly important to Coyote’s business operations, the Green Exchange  space requires significant renovation to update the communication infrastructure in the building.   To update the communication infrastructure will require the installation of miles of high-speed  fiber-optic cables from the AT&T hub.  Due to the nature of Coyote’s business, (all operations  require a high volume of digital data transmission and reception) the installation of fiber-optic  cable is essential. The installation of this cable will not only benefit Coyote, but will also enable  the surrounding community to connect to the fiber-optic cable lines at a significantly lower cost,  once Coyote absorbs the cost of laying the infrastructure.

PUBLIC BENEFITS    The proposed project will provide the following public benefits.     Property Taxes:  The project will expand the tax base by return of a vacant manufacturing  facility to the tax rolls.    Sales Taxes:  This development will house new retail businesses that will generate new sales tax  revenue.      Environmental Features:  The Green Exchange will offer a unique collection of eco- friendly  businesses focused on the environment.   The project will be the first industrial renovation to  achieve a LEED Gold Certification in the City of Chicago.      Permanent Jobs: Coyote will create/retain a minimum of 300 permanent jobs.  In addition, they  have expressed interest in job training and placement programs and will work with DCD's  Workforce Solutions Division to further these opportunities.      Construction Jobs:  The project will produce 75-100 temporary construction and consultant  jobs.    Affirmative Action:  The developer will comply with the requirements of the Chicago  Affirmative Action Ordinance which requires contract participation by Minority owned business  enterprises at a level or 24% of total construction hard costs, and participation of Women owned  business enterprises at a level of 4% of total construction hard costs.  The developer has provided  notification of the proposed project, by certified mail, to eight associations of minority and  women owned contractors.  A sample version of the letter and copies of the post office receipts  for the certified letters are presented a exhibits in this report.    City Residency:  The developer will comply with the requirements of the City of Chicago  Residency Ordinance which requires 50% of all construction hours be worked by city residents.   The developer will also comply with the City of Chicago’s Prevailing Wage requirement.      VIII.  COMMUNITY SUPPORT    1st Ward Alderman Proco ""Joe"" Moreno endorses the action and has provided a letter of support.   In addition, the Logan Square Chamber of Commerce and the LEED Council are in support of  this action.  See exhibits for copies of support letters.                IX.  CONFORMANCE WITH REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLAN/COMMUNITY PLAN    The proposed project is located in the Addison South Tax Increment Financing Redevelopment  Project Area.  The proposed project will satisfy the following goals of the area=s redevelopment  plan:    Addison South TIF     •  This action is consistent with the Addison South TIF Plan established in 2007 for the   following reasons:      - Provide for the orderly transition from obsolete uses to economically sustainable land   - Encourage private investment, especially improvements to industrial and commercial      development patterns.   property.            - Reduce or eliminate deleterious conditions.  - Encourage redevelopment on parcels that are underutilized and vacant.          - Encourage the preservation and reuse of historic buildings.      - Create an attractive environment that encourages new industrial and commercial        development and increases the tax base.

By late May, Department of Water Management (DWM) crews will begin to install a new sewer  main in W. Cullerton Street (Karlov-alley east of Kostner).  The old sewer main dates back to 1902,  and needs to be replaced.     After completion of the sewer main project, we will install a new water main in S. Keeler Avenue  (18th Street-Cullerton) and in W. Cullerton Street (Kostner-Pulaski).  The old water main dates  back to 1903, and also needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the projects, please go to  wwww.BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your  name, email address and the project identification numbers at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will always  be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open for  local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).    We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved by the start of  the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    24th Ward Office: 773-533-2400    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to  where the water comes into the home that is not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.   Next flush any other cold water faucets on that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Commissioner of Water Management     Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub. Fully open the cold water tap, and let the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Then move to the next highest floor and repeat flushing for at least 5 minutes. Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  The aerator should be removed prior to flushing.   Flushing will help maintain optimum water quality by removing sediment, rust, metals, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your property’s water service line.  If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or 311.  It is advised that you flush your water line for 5 minutes if it has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours.      Revised Graphic  Try not to use faucets for flushing that would bring the particles into the household.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,786 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Hoyne Avenue from W.  Ohio Street to W. Lake Street. The old pipe dates back to 1873, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Maldonado’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project.

WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,786 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Hoyne Avenue from W. Ohio Street to W. Lake Street.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1873 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the job to be  completed in late June 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Hoyne Avenue outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      ALDERMAN ROBERTO MALDONADO   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   3-1-1   773-395-0143   312-742-1029                                                     FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS           What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June 2014.  This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is  any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

By late October 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 3,303 feet of new 8-inch and 66 feet of new 12-inch water  main in S. Torrence Avenue, from E. 104th Street to E. 109th Street, E. 107th Street, from S. Hoxie Avenue  to S. Torrence Avenue, E. 104th Street, from S. Hoxie Avenue to S. Torrence Avenue and S. Hoxie Avenue,  from E. 102nd Street to E. 104th Street. The old water main dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.  We expect the water main work to be completed by mid January 2018. Restoration will follow in mid  April 2018. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name, email  address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new pipes,  to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open  for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the next  workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything possible to  maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful  neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  10th Ward Office:773-768-8138  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the new  water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including any lead to  maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your  faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside hose  spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where the  water comes into the home that is not used for drinking  water. Fully open the cold water tap and let the water  run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any other cold  water faucets on that floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water tested,  please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice- chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at least  5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and doing  laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your home  to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and E. 68th Street, from S. Calumet  Avenue to S. Anthony Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in late November 2015. Restoration will follow in mid April 2016. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Calumet Avenue, E. 70th Place, E. 70th Street and E.  68th Street outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it  to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it  means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local  traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                                            CONTACT NUMBERS   ALDERMAN WILLIE COCHRAN   773-955-5610       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  November 2015. Restoration will follow in mid April 2016. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
