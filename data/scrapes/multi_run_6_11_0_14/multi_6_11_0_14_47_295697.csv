SH Bell, que, junto con al menos una compañía  más en el vecindario, maneja y almacena materiales que contienen manganeso. Con el fin de  garantizar la salud y la seguridad de todo el vecindario, el Chicago Department of Public Health  (Departamento de Salud Pública de Chicago o CDPH, por sus siglas en inglés) está analizando o  tomando muestras de tierra y de aire en su zona para determinar si existen niveles elevados de  manganeso u otros metales que puedan representar un riesgo potencial para la salud de las  personas.  ¿Qué es el manganeso?   El manganeso es una sustancia de origen natural. Se trata de un nutriente esencial y es importante  incorporar una pequeña cantidad a su dieta para permanecer saludable. También se utiliza para  fabricar acero y se encuentra presente en muchos productos de consumo. Sin embargo, si se inhala  en cantidades excesivas, puede ser perjudicial para el tejido nervioso.   ¿Cuál es el propósito de tomar muestras de tierra y de aire?  El CDPH está recolectando muestras de tierra y de aire para determinar si existe un exceso de  manganeso en el área. Si bien el manganeso es de origen natural, tomamos muestras para  determinar si existen niveles de manganeso o de otros metales que puedan causar problemas para  su salud o el medioambiente.  ¿Por qué se toman muestras en mi propiedad y no en la de mis vecinos?  El CDPH está tomando muestras en diferentes ubicaciones en toda la comunidad. Cada lugar de  muestreo fue seleccionado de manera aleatoria.   ¿Cómo el Chicago Department of Public Health tomará las muestras de tierra y de aire?  Una vez que usted brinda su consentimiento, técnicos capacitados llevarán a cabo el procedimiento  descrito a continuación para tomar las muestras de tierra:   1.  Toman fotografías de la propiedad para su documentación.  2.  Toman un pequeño frasco de muestras de tierra de su patio y las envían a un laboratorio   para su análisis.    3.  Rellenan con tierra nueva el área donde se tomó la muestra para restaurarla al mismo  estado en el que se encontraba antes, incluso se reemplaza el césped o la vegetación  que pueda haberse alterado.    Dependiendo de los resultados de la muestra de tierra, nuestros técnicos determinarán si es  necesario tomar una muestra de aire o no. Nos comunicaremos directamente con usted antes de  que se tomen muestras de aire. Se espera que todas las actividades de muestreo se completen en  dos días. Los resultados estarán disponibles luego de que se concluyan todos los muestreos.  ¿Qué se hará después de tener los resultados?  Si los resultados muestran un exceso en las cantidades de manganeso, el CDPH trabajará junto  con otras agencias del estado, líderes electos y grupos comunitarios para determinar los próximos  pasos adecuados a fin de garantizar que el medioambiente se encuentre limpio y saludable.   ¿Qué debo hacer si tengo un problema de salud que creo que se debe al manganeso?  Si usted o un miembro de la familia tienen una enfermedad u otro problema de salud que cree que  se debe a la exposición excesiva al manganeso, infórmeselo a su médico.   ¿Qué debo hacer si tengo otras preguntas o inquietudes?  Puede hablar con el técnico que toma las muestras o puede llamar directamente al CDPH, al  (312) 746-6621.

11350`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxSupportingInformation/AmusementTaxGeneralInfo-UpdatedFor2018.pdf`Success`Success`1`1`Not a fillable PDF.`"IS YOUR EVENT SUBJECT TO THE CHICAGO AMUSEMENT TAX?      Section  4-156-020  of  the  Chicago  Municipal  Code  imposes  a  tax  upon  the  patrons  of  every  amusement  within  the  City.    The  tax  is  based  on  the  admission  fees  or  other  charges  for  the  privilege  to  enter,  to  witness,  to  view  or  to  participate  in the  amusement.    This  publication  is  a  summary.   Please consult the ordinance and any applicable rulings or other official statements for details.    What is an amusement?  In general, all entertainment or recreational activities offered for public participation or on a membership or other basis are  amusements subject to the tax.      How  do  I  know  if  my  event  is  taxable?    Examples  of  taxable  fees  or  charges  include  but  are  not  limited  to  those  for  sporting  events,  concerts,  movies, cover charges, pub crawls, sport and social clubs, tours, cruises, etc.      Who  is  responsible  for  collecting  and  remitting  the  tax?    Owners,  managers,  and  operators  of  amusements  or  places  where  amusements  are  conducted  and  resellers  must  collect  from  patrons  the  tax  imposed  by  the  amusement  tax  code.  Note:  ""Operator""  means  any  person  who  sells  or  resells a ticket to an amusement or who, directly or through an agreement or arrangement with another party indirectly,  collects the charges paid for  the sale or resale of a ticket to an amusement. The term includes, but is not limited to, persons engaged in the business of selling or reselling tickets to  amusements,  whether  on-line,  in  person  or  otherwise.  The  term  also  includes  persons  engaged  in  the  business  of  facilitating  the  sale  or  resale  of  tickets to amusements, whether on-line, in person or otherwise.    What is the tax rate?  The tax rate is 9% of charges paid.  The term ""charges paid"" includes any and all charges that the patron pays incidental to  obtaining  the  privilege  to  enter,  to  witness,  to  view  or  to  participate  in  an  amusement,  including  but  not  limited  to  any  and  all  related  markups,  service fees, convenience fees, facilitation fees, cancelation fees and other such charges, regardless of terminology.    The  capacity  of  my  venue  is  not  more  than  1,500  persons.    Are  my  events  exempt  from  the  tax?      The  Amusement  Tax  shall  not  apply  to  admission fees to witness in person live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in the city whose maximum  capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is not more than 1,500 persons.  Note: this exemption applies only to venues where admission  fees are paid to witness live cultural performances.  It does not apply to charges for movies, pub crawls, sporting events, etc.  The 9% Amusement  Tax will continue to apply to these types of amusements, regardless of venue capacity.      How should resale transactions be taxed?  The rate of tax imposed upon the buyer of a ticket in a resale transaction shall be equal to 3% of the  admission fees or other charges paid for the ticket in the resale transaction.   If the buyer in a resale transaction purchases the ticket for purposes of  resale,  then  no  tax  shall be  due  from  the  buyer  on  the  purchase  if  the  buyer  is  registered  with  the City's  Department  of  Finance  as  a  tax  collector  under Section 4-156-030.  Finally, if the original sale of a ticket is exempt, then the resale of that ticket is exempt as well.   How do I get registered with the Department of Finance? If you do not have an account number with the City of Chicago and your business does  not require a license issued by the City, complete and submit a Tax Registration Form and an Affidavit for Initial Tax Period.  If you already have an  account number with the City because you have a business license or are registered for another tax, you do not need to submit the Tax Registration  Form.  You  may  submit  the  Affidavit  for  Initial  Tax  Period  indicating  your  existing  City  of  Chicago  account  number.    Please  visit  our  website  at  www.cityofchicago.org to obtain these forms.   When is my payment due?  Amusement Tax must be remitted on or before the 15th day of the month following the month in which the liability was  incurred.   When is my tax return due?  Amusement Tax returns are due on August 15th for the preceding fiscal year of July 1st through June 30th.     How  do  I  apply  for  an  exemption?    Certain  live  cultural  performances  as  well  as  certain  amusements  sponsored  by  religious,  charitable,  or  educational not-for-profit organizations for fund-raising purposes are exempt (restricted to two events per calendar year not exceeding a total of 14  calendar days.)  If  you think your event is  exempt from  Amusement Tax in accordance with Section 4-156-020B(5)(a) through (g) of the Chicago  Amusement Tax ordinance, you must submit an Amusement Tax Exemption Application at least 30 calendar days prior to the date of the amusement,  or 15 calendar days prior to the date that admission tickets to the amusement are first made available for sale, whichever is earlier.  The application  can be found on our website at  www.cityofchicago.org.  For Amusement Tax exemption requests in accordance with 4-156-020B(5)(a)through (f),  the  applicant  must  demonstrate  that  the  proceeds  intended  to  inure  exclusively  to  the  benefit  of  the  exempt  entity  or  entities  are  reasonably  anticipated to equal at least 10 percent of the gross revenues from the amusement.    Have more questions regarding the Amusement Tax or other taxes enforced by the Chicago Department of Finance?  Please contact Customer  Service by phone at 312-747-4747 or via e-mail at revenuedatabase@cityofchicago.org.     "

By early October 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Reliable Contracting &  Equipment Company crews will begin the work to rehabilitate 325 feet of existing 6-inch water main in  E. 91st Street, from S. Mackinaw Avenue to S. Green Bay Avenue. The old water main dates back to 1891,  and needs to be rehabilitated which will minimize surface impacts to surrounding area. We expect all  work to be completed by late November 2017. Dates may change depending on weather and other  factors.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left open  for local traffic only. We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours  (generally 7am-4pm).  Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by  the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible. A temporary  bypass water main will be installed in the parkway above ground to provide temporary water supply  during the timeframe the existing water main under the street is being cleaned and lined.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything possible to  maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful  neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  10th Ward Office: 773-768-8138  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   When we switch over the services from the old main to the temporary service main and newly  rehabilitated water main, we will interrupt water service.  When switching your water service to the  temporary main, the contractor’s plumber may need access to your building to set up the temporary  connection. This connection will be made either to an exterior hose bib or other accessible connection  point. We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.            Genwmnot03032016   Water Service Sampling     Flushing after Your Service Line has been Disconnected and Reconnected     Throughout the course of this rehabilitation project, CDWM Water Quality plans to perform frequent  water service sampling and analysis to ensure our high standards are maintained. Our staff will need to  visit your dwelling several times throughout the project to collect samples. We will soon be visiting to  collect contact information and provide additional details about the sampling schedule.   Throughout the course of this project your water service will be disconnected and reconnected to the  newly rehabilitated water main. After these reconnections are completed, it is important to flush your  plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your  faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside hose  spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where the  water comes into the home that is not used for drinking  water. Fully open the cold water tap and let the water  run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any other cold  water faucets on that floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water tested,  please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit http://www.epa.gov/il/advice- chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at least  5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and doing  laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your home  to help you save money on your water bill.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 526 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Harper Avenue, from E.  52nd Street to E. 53rd Street. The old pipe dates back to 1897, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Burns’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman William Burns                       4th Ward    1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          Do you wonder what was happening in 1897?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                             ELVA ZONA HEASTER        Elva Zona Heaster was found dead in Greenbrier County, West Virginia.  The resulting  murder trial of her husband was perhaps the only case in United States history where the  testimony of a ghost helped secure a conviction.     Grant’s Tomb was dedicated.    The Klondike Gold Rush began when the first successful prospectors arrived in Seattle.    The Boston subway opened, becoming the first underground metro in North America.    Dracula, a novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, was published.    The play Cyrano de Bergerac, by Edmund Rostand, premiered in Paris, France.                   HARPER WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 526 feet of 8-inch water  main in S. Harper Avenue, from E. 52nd Street to E. 53rd Street.       Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1897 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late November 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Harper Avenue outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.                  CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN WILLIAM BURNS   773-536-8103   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late November  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.                Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

24212`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dps/Outreach/Professional_Declaration_of_Eligibility_FAQ-s.pdf`Success`Success`3`3`Not a fillable PDF.`PROFESSIONAL DECLARATION OF ELIGIBILITY  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  Q: What is the Professional Declaration of Eligibility?  A: The Department of Procurement Services administers the Supplier Diversity Professional Declaration of Eligibility Program. This program offers an additional certification option for eligible firms by allowing qualified attorneys, certified public accountants, and certifying agencies to attest that an applicant firm meets the requirements of the City of Chicago’s certification program. These qualified attorneys, certified public accountants, and certifying agencies must follow strict guidelines to ensure that only qualified applicants are recommended for certification, and that the application package does not contain any false information. This program also allows these professionals and certifying agencies to attest that the applicant applying for expansion of new specialty areas meets the requirements of the certification program.  Q: Why has this program been established?  A: The regulations governing the Supplier Diversity program require the Department of Procurement Services to complete our review of certifications 90- days after receipt of all required documents. However, we wanted to establish a way whereby a vendor could participate in a potential contracting opportunity by proving their certification status via a licensed professional before presenting their application to the City. Upon submission of a Professional Declaration of Eligibility to our office, the Department of Procurement Services will make a final determination within five business days.  Q: Who is eligible for certification under this program?  A: Any firm eligible to do business with the City that is non-construction,  nonsupplier/ distributor MBE/WBE firm, and the following criteria are met:  1. The firm has not been denied by the City of Chicago for certification within  the previous three years.  2. The firm has not withdrawn a certification application with the City of  Chicago within previous three years.  3. The firm has not graduated from the City of Chicago’s certification  program within the previous three years.  Q: Can firms seeking ACDBE and DBE certifications obtain certification under the Professional Declaration of Eligibility?  A: No. Only firms seeking M/WBE certifications are eligible under this program.  1  Q: When will the program be available?  A: Starting December 6, 2010.  Q: Who is eligible to be a Professional of Record?  A: Any attorney or CPA licensed in Illinois for at least 3 years who is currently in good standing with their licensing board and meets the following criteria:  1. Has not been convicted or found liable for fraud, or making false  statements.  2. Does not have an ownership interest or familial relationships with the   firm or its owner. Is not ineligible to do business with the City.  3.  Q: What forms are necessary to become certified under the program?  A: A firm must submit a Schedule A application and all of the supporting required documentation to the professional or certifying agency. All of the forms are located on our website www.cityofchicago.org/procurement. The professional or certifying agency is required to review the application and all supporting documentation and then, if the firm is eligible, submit a signed and dated Professional Declaration of Eligibility Statement in which the professional or certifying agency shall be required to attest to the City and to the person hiring or otherwise retaining the Professional of Record that the firm is indeed eligible under the rules and regulations of the program. In addition, the Professional Declaration of Eligibility Statement must also be signed by the owner of the firm for whom the attorney or CPA is employed. The professional must forward the Schedule A and all of the firm’s documentation to the Department of Procurement Services for a final review.  Q: Does the City have a list of Eligible Professionals of Record?  A: No, the city does not endorse a particular professional or certifying agency. Contact your local CPA or attorney for participation.  Q: Does applying for certification under the Professional Declaration of Eligibility guarantee certification?  A: No. The professional or certifying agency is required to process a certification file according to the same rules and regulations as the Department of Procurement Services.
