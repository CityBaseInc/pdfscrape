This policy statement for construction projects, which is a part of  the SBI, institutes a program for small local businesses to be exclusive bidders on certain construction projects.    In response to feedback from the vendor community, the program has been divided into two tiers, SBI I and SBI  II. This tiered system establishes standards that allow greater opportunities for smaller businesses.      I.    A.     To qualify for this construction program, a business must be a small local business enterprise as defined by    Eligibility   the  program  rules.    In making  a determination  whether  a business  meets  that  definition,  the  Chief  Procurement   Officer will consider, among other factors, whether the business:     Has been in business for at least one (1) year;     Will  perform  the  majority  of  the  work  on  the  construction  project  with  its  own  forces  and/or   subcontractors who are also small local business enterprises;      Is independent, and not an affiliate or subsidiary of any other business;     Has its principal place of business and the majority of its full-time, regular work force located in  the  Six-County  region  identified  in  Section  2-92-670,  as  evidenced  by  location  of  their  employment as reported to federal and state taxing authorities;      For the SBI I program, has gross receipts, averaged over the firm’s previous five fiscal years,  or  number  of  employees,  per  pay  period  averaged  over  the  past  twelve  months,  that  do  not  exceed the size standards set forth in 13 C.F.R. Part 121;     For the SBI II program, has gross receipts, averaged over the firm’s previous five fiscal years,  or  number  of  employees,  per  pay  period  averaged  over  the  past  twelve  months,  that  do  not  exceed 50% the size standards set forth in 13 C.F.R. Part 121.        B.    Independence  of  a  business  is  determined  solely  by  the  Chief  Procurement  Officer  or  his  or  her  designee.    Indicia  of  independence  include  the  ability  of  the  applicant  to  perform  satisfactorily  in  its  area(s)  of  specialty   without substantial reliance upon finances, resources, bonding, expertise, staff, facilities, or equipment of another   individual  business.    Recognition  of  the  applicant  as  a  separate  and  distinct  entity  by  governmental  taxing   authorities is not dispositive of the applicant’s assertion of independence.  Independence will be evaluated as of   the date the applicant was established through and including the date of application to the SBI.      C.  SBI  is  race  and  gender  neutral.    Any  small  business  that  meets  the  definition  of  small  local  business   enterprise is eligible to bid on a SBI construction contract.  For the SBI I program,  City-Certified minority business   enterprises (MBEs), Women’s Business Enterprise (WBEs), by definition in Section 2-92-670, must also be small   local business enterprise in order to be certified as MBE, WBE, and therefore, they will be presumed to meet the   definition.  The City also has an approved small business program for federally-funded contracts. Disadvantaged   Business Enterprise (DBE) program.  The Chief Procurement Officer will issue a form of affidavit for non-certified                             Mayor Rahm Emanuel              City of Chicago                    Small Business Initiative (SBI) Construction Program      Policy Statement                                      firms  to  attest  that  they  meet  the  definition.    For  the  SBI  II  program,  all  bidders  will  be  required  to  submit  an   affidavit,  regardless  of  certification  status.  The  Chief  Procurement  Officer  reserves  the  right  to  conduct   investigations to determine the accuracy of the information provided in such affidavits.

Implementation      A.  The  Department  of Procurement  Services  (DPS)  will  identify  construction  projects  in the  City’s  Buying  Plan,   updated  each  quarter,  which  will  be  offered  exclusively  to  small  local  business  enterprises  through  this  SBI   construction program.  The projects will be sized appropriately for small businesses and typically will be limited to   estimated project construction costs of $3,000,000 or less for SBI I projects, $2,000,000 or less for SBI II projects.      B.  For  those  bidders  who  have  not  already  been  determined  to  be  small  local  business  enterprises,  the  bid   package for each SBI construction program procurement will contain the affidavit referred to in Section 1.C. above   to be completed by the bidder.      C.  Businesses  which  have  been  determined  to  be  small  local  business  enterprises  will  be  required  to  submit   annual  affidavits  confirming  their  continued  compliance  with the  eligibility  requirements  of  SBI.    These firms  will   also be subject to an on-going responsibility to inform DPS of any changes in their status in the interim that might   affect their compliance with SBI’s requirements.      D.  The  bid  package  for  SBI  construction  program  procurements  will  also  include  reporting  forms  which  will  be   required to be completed by successful bidders at the conclusion of the contract which will report on job creation   related to the performance of the City contract as well as other work force, bottom line and anecdotal evidence of   the  impact  of  the  SBI  construction  program  on  the  bidder.    Failure  to  complete  and  submit  reports  as  required   may result in a bidder being declared ineligible for further participation in the SBI construction program.

In mid-September, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 4,622  feet of new 8-inch water main in W. Cortez Street (Spaulding-Kedzie), in W. Thomas Street  (Spaulding-Kedzie), and in W. Haddon Avenue (Spaulding-Kedzie). The old water main dates back  to 1901, and needs to be replaced.     If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    26th Ward Office: 773-395-0143    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016   When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.       (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.             If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

Redesign Logan Square  The  redesign  of  Logan  Square,  coupled  with  traffic  calming  techniques,  could  make  the  area  around  the  Illinois Centennial Column more conducive to passive open space activities. Milwaukee Avenue could be rerouted around the monument, similar to a European rotary, providing an opportunity to join the two parcels that now constitute Logan Square. In addition to needed restorations of historic lighting on the site, an existing comfort/maintenance station on the site could be converted to a concession building to provide more amenities for site users. Some members of the com- munity did not believe a rotary would actually calm traffic.  Others proposed an alternative—make the rounded edges of the existing Logan Square parcels angular and restore land at the periphery to expand green space.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,510 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Ridgeway Avenue, from  W. Montrose Avenue to W. Irving Park Road. The old pipe dates back to 1896, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Arena’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                       •  German physicist Wilhelm Rontgen announced his discovery of x-rays.  •  The Tootsie Roll was introduced.  •  The first movie theater opened, charging ten cents for admission.  •  The modern Olympic Games began in Athens, Greece.  •  The first car accident occurred, when Henry Wells hit a bicyclist in New York City.  •  Yosemite became a national park.  •   ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" was written by John Philip Sousa.                                     RIDGEWAY AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,510 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Ridgeway Avenue, from W. Montrose Avenue to W. Irving Park Road.    Reason:  The old main consists of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further the old  pipe dates back to 1896 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main work  to be completed in mid November 2015. Restoration will follow in mid April 2016. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Ridgeway Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ALDERMAN JOHN ARENA   773-286-4545   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1                                           FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in mid  November 2015. Restoration will follow in mid April 2016. We always hesitate to promise  specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere  in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Sedgwick, 4th Floor, Chicago, IL 60654               cchrfilings@cityofchicago.org    www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations   INFORMATION FOR COMPLAINANTS     This publication describes some of the rules and procedures that apply to complainants in discrimination  cases filed at the Chicago Commission on Human Relations.  This is not  a full statement of all laws and  procedures that may apply.  It does not constitute legal advice and may not be cited as legal authority.        If you are a complainant in a pending case, please keep this publication for reference as the case proceeds.    About the Commission on Human Relations    The Commission on Human Relations is the City of Chicago agency which enforces the Chicago Human  Rights Ordinance and the Chicago Fair Housing Ordinance.  Decisions, orders, and subpoenas issued by the  Commission are legally binding and enforceable through state court.  The Commission also works to eliminate  prejudice and discrimination in Chicago through activities such as monitoring the incidence of hate crimes and  assisting hate crime victims, mediating inter-group tensions, conducting educational programs, and advising  City  government  on  matters  involving  prejudice  and  discrimination.    The  work  of  the  Commission  is  authorized by Chapters 2-120, 2-160, and 5-8 of the Chicago Municipal Code.  Members of the Board of  Commissioners are appointed by the Mayor and approved by the City Council.    About Discrimination Complaints    Accepting your complaint does not mean the Commission has decided that an ordinance violation occurred.   The complaint filing only starts the process of deciding the case.  The procedures for receiving, investigating,  and adjudicating discrimination complaints under the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance and Chicago Fair  Housing  Ordinance  are  stated  in  Section  2-120-510(e)-(q)  of  the  Chicago  Municipal  Code  and  in  the  implementing regulations adopted by the Board of Commissioners.     Available Legal Information and Forms    The Commission provides publications and forms to assist persons who may file complaints (complainants) as  well as those who may be charged with discrimination (respondents).  Most of them are available on the  Commission's web site (www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations).  Among the available publications are copies  of the applicable ordinances, regulations, and a Board Rulings Digest summarizing decisions issued after  administrative hearings, including the relief awarded if a violation was found.  All Board rulings and many  other  Commission  decisions  can  be  cited  as  precedent.  For  more  information  on  precedents,  see  Section  270.500 of the regulations and the free publication Researching Commission Law.    About Investigations    The Commission on Human Relations conducts an investigation of every discrimination complaint filed by a  member of the public.  The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether there is substantial evidence of  a  violation  of  the  Chicago  Human  Rights  Ordinance  or  Chicago  Fair  Housing  Ordinance.    A  finding  of  substantial  evidence  is  not  a  finding  that  an  ordinance  violation  occurred,  but  only  that  there  is  enough  evidence for the case to proceed to an administrative hearing.  If the Commission finds there is no substantial  evidence of a violation, the case will be dismissed.  Commission Regulation 220.110 describes in more detail  the scope of an investigation and the investigative methods that may be used.          Issued: 11/6/15     Page 1     Neutral Role of Investigator and Commission      Within a few days after a complaint is filed, the Commission assigns an investigator to the case.  Investigators  do  not  decide  whether  there  is  substantial  evidence  or  make  any  other  ruling  in  the  case.    The  assigned  investigator serves as the Commission's contact person during the investigation process, receives the parties'  written submissions, obtains other evidence as needed, and compiles this material for consideration by the  senior staff of the Commission, who make the necessary decisions at the investigation stage.      Commission personnel are neutral investigators and decision-makers.  The Commission does not prosecute  your  case  for  you  and  is  not  your  lawyer.    Commission  personnel  may  answer  general  questions  about  applicable laws and procedures but may not advise or coach you (or any respondent).  Members of the Board  of Commissioners do not become involved with a case unless it comes before them for a final ruling after an  administrative hearing.    Response Deadline and Extensions of Time    After a complaint is filed, the Commission notifies each named respondent by mail.  The mailing includes a  copy of the complaint, a deadline to submit a written response, and information about how to respond.  A  respondent may seek an extension of time to submit all or part of the response and supporting documentation.   If this happens, the respondent should serve on you (usually by mail) a copy of the motion for extension of  time,  and  the  Commission  will  mail  you  a  copy  of  its  order  granting  or  denying  the  extension.    If  the  Commission grants an extension, the order will also give you more time to submit your reply and supporting  documentation.     Your Opportunity to Reply and Deadline for Supporting Documentation    The Commission sends a mailing to you, the complainant, at the same time it notifies each respondent of the  filing of your complaint.  Your mailing sets a deadline for you to reply to any response and to submit all  available supporting documentation.  A reply is your opportunity to state in writing your position about the  facts  or  arguments  in  a  respondent's  written  response  to  your  complaint.    Supporting  documentation  is  information  you  have  (or  know  about)  which  can  be  used  as  evidence  to  prove  your  case  or  dispute  a  respondent's  position.    It  is  especially  important  that  you  meet  the  deadline  to  submit  your  supporting  documentation, to make sure all the information you have is considered in deciding whether there is substantial  evidence.    The  Commission  provides  forms  which  you  may  use  to  submit  your  reply  and  supporting  documentation.    Settlement and Mediation    The Commission encourages voluntary settlement of cases between the parties and often facilitates settlement  discussions.  But the Commission never requires parties to settle or to accept particular settlement terms.  To  assist the parties with settlement discussions, the Commission can schedule a settlement conference with an  independent mediator who does not participate in any decisions concerning the case or disclose what was  discussed.  Commission staff can also facilitate settlement discussions and can explain the procedures for  closing  a  case  if  an  agreement  is  reached.    For  more  information,  see  Subpart  230  of  the  Commission's  regulations and the free Commission publication Settlement and Mediation.    Amended Complaints    You  may  wish  to  amend  your  complaint,  for  example,  to  correct  errors  in  the  names  or  addresses  of  respondents, to add new respondents (or complainants), to allege new claims or incidents of discrimination, or  to clarify or amplify your previous allegations.  Specific rules apply to the amendment of complaints; they are  stated in Regs. 210.145, 210.150, and 210.160.  If you wish to amend your complaint during the investigation  process,  you may contact the assigned investigator for assistance in preparing it.   If you file an amended   Issued: 11/6/15     Page 2   complaint during the investigation stage, the Commission will mail a copy to each named respondent with a  deadline to file and serve a response, and you will have an opportunity to reply if a response is filed.        Completing the Investigation     In conducting an investigation, the Commission always reviews the complaint, any amended complaints, the  written responses, and any other written submissions of the parties.  The Commission may seek more evidence  as necessary to determine whether there is substantial evidence of an ordinance violation.  For example, the  Commission may interview witnesses, obtain additional documents, conduct testing, and inspect premises and  other  physical  evidence.    This  evidence  gathering  may  occur  at  any  time  after  a  complaint  is  filed.    The  Commission  determines  how  the  investigation  will  proceed  and  is  not  required  to  interview  individuals  suggested by a party.  See Section 220.100 of the Commission's regulations for more information.    How Long Does an Investigation Take?      Typically, respondents have 28 days from the mailing of the notice of complaint filing to submit a response,  and  complainants  have  another  28  days  to  submit  a  reply.    Extensions  of  time  may  be  granted.    The  Commission cannot be sure what additional evidence gathering is needed until it reviews these documents.  In  general, the Commission tries to complete the oldest pending investigations before turning to newer ones.  As a  complainant, you can help keep investigation delays to a minimum by promptly submitting a reply to any  response and all available supporting documentation, and by cooperating with the remaining investigation.      Investigative Orders and Subpoenas     Although the Commission prefers voluntary cooperation, it may issue investigative orders requiring you (or any  respondent) to submit certain documents or information, to appear for an interview, or to make premises or  other physical evidence available for inspection.  The Commission can require a business respondent to make  an owner, officer, director, or employee available for an interview.  Details about investigative orders are in  Reg. 220.120.     The Commission may use its subpoena power to obtain evidence during an investigation.  Usually a subpoena  is used to obtain information from a witness or organization that is not a party to the case, if the third party will  not voluntarily cooperate.  Subpoenas are only rarely issued to parties.  Details about Commission subpoenas  are stated in Section 2-120-510(k) of the Chicago Municipal Code and Section 220.200 of the Commission's  regulations.    Deciding Whether There Is Substantial Evidence      After completing its investigation, the Commission's authorized senior staff decide whether there is substantial  evidence to support each claim in the complaint.  The Commission then issues a written order stating its  decision.      Review of Commission Decisions    If your case or a particular claim is dismissed, you may file and serve a request for review arguing that the  dismissal was in error and the claim should be reinstated.  A respondent may, by written motion, request an  opportunity to submit a response.  The Commission will issue a written ruling.  See Section 250.100 of the  Commission's regulations for more information.    If the Commission finds substantial evidence of an ordinance violation, the respondent does not have the right  to internal review or reconsideration of that decision.  Instead, the administrative hearing process will go  forward.  For more information on review of Commission decisions, see Section 250.100 of the regulations.             3     Administrative Hearings and Board Rulings      If  the  Commission  finds  substantial  evidence  (or  finds  a  respondent  in  default)  the  case  proceeds  to  the  administrative  hearing  process.    If  that  happens,  you  will  receive  a  mailing  about  the  hearing  schedule,  procedures, and your rights and responsibilities.  You, the complainant, must prove the case at the hearing.   The Commission does not prosecute the case or present the evidence for you.     Access to Case Records    Commission orders and decisions are issued in writing and mailed to all parties (except investigative orders,  which are mailed only to the party required to comply).  Witness interviews are summarized in writing.  These,  along with the written submissions of the parties and any documents obtained from other sources, constitute the  investigation file for the case.  The parties may arrange to inspect this file and purchase copies of documents  after the Commission issues its order concluding the investigation but not while the investigation is pending.   See Reg. 220.410 for more information.  If the case proceeds to an administrative hearing, a hearing record is  maintained as a public document.  Reg. 240.510.  Complaints are also public documents.  Reg. 220.410(b).   After a case is closed, members of the public may be able to inspect the file under the Freedom of Information  Act.  Procedures are available for a party to seek an order limiting disclosure of certain information, for good  cause.  Regs. 220.410(a)(2) and 240.520.       Attorney Representation      You may be represented by an attorney at any time while a case is pending.  Your attorney must file and serve  an attorney appearance.  The Commission has an appearance form but attorneys usually use their own.  If you  receive an appearance from an attorney representing another party, whether a co-complainant or respondent,  you must then direct all written and oral communications intended for that party to the attorney; that is, you  may not communicate directly with the party but only through the attorney.  For more information on attorney  appearances and withdrawals, see Section 270.300 of the Commission's regulations.    Is an Attorney Necessary?      You are not required to have an attorney, even for an administrative hearing, but if you proceed without an  attorney (pro se) you must still comply with legal requirements.  Complainants are encouraged to seek legal  assistance because discrimination cases can be complex.    The Commission provides a Legal Assistance Information list of not-for-profit resources as a starting point but  does not make referrals to attorneys.  Also, the Chicago area has a number of lawyer referral services, usually  operated by bar associations.  Some attorneys will represent complainants in discrimination cases without pre- payment  of  a  fee,  because  if  the  Board  rules  in  your  favor after a hearing,  your attorney can petition for  attorney fees, to be paid by the losing respondent.     Communicating with the Commission    During the investigation, please direct all telephone calls, correspondence, and filings to the attention of the  assigned  investigator  whose  name  has  been  provided  to  you.    If  the  case  goes  into  the  mediation  or  administrative  hearing  process,  you  will  receive  the  name  of  another  contact  person.    Meetings  with  Commission staff after the filing of a complaint are by appointment only, as needed.         Filing and Serving Documents       Document filings are accepted at the Commission's reception desk during business hours.  Most documents        4   that you file must also be served on the complainant and any other respondent, plus the hearing officer if one  has been appointed.  The Commission's detailed rules about filing and serving documents are stated in the     regulations printed below.  It is important to follow these rules or your documents may not be accepted.  The  Commission has a Notice of Hearing and Certificate of Service form to help you file and serve documents.    Reg. 270.210  Service of Documents   (a)   Manner of Service               Unless otherwise ordered, all motions, orders, notices, discovery, and other items which are required  to be served may be served (i) in person, (ii) by depositing the item to be served a United States  mailbox, (iii) by sending an electronic facsimile (fax) copy of the item, or (iv) by sending a copy of the  item by electronic mail (e-mail) under the procedures of Reg. 270.230.  Documents required to be  served must be received, not sent, on the due date.  Service by mail shall be deemed complete three  days after the postmarked mailing date of the item, properly addressed to the person to be served,  unless such person proves that the item was not actually received on that day.  Facsimiles and e-mail  transmissions must be received by 5:00 p.m. in order to be deemed received on a particular day.      (b)   Certificate of Service   If service is required, a certificate of service or equivalent written evidence of service must be filed  with the Commission and served on the hearing officer, if any, within 7 days of the service date.  A  certificate of service consists of a signed statement of the individual causing service, specifying the  material served, the person or persons to whom service was made, and for each person the manner and  date of service including the address, facsimile number, e-mail address or other location where mailed  or delivered.

The Commission is not required to provide  copying  services  for  individuals  attempting  to  file.    Photocopies  of  evidentiary  documents  are  preferred unless otherwise ordered, provided that the party must retain each original document and  produce it as ordered.  Except for initial complaints, each document or set of documents filed must  conspicuously state on the first page or a cover page the case number for which the filing is intended.

(b)   Manner of Filing   Documents  are  deemed  filed  when  received  at  the  Commission,  not  when  sent.    Documents  are  accepted  for  filing  at  the  Commission  between  9:00  a.m.  and  5:00  p.m.  on  business  days  unless  otherwise  ordered  or  posted  conspicuously  at  the  Commission.    Documents  filed  by facsimile  or  electronic mail must be received by 5:00 p.m. in order to be deemed received on a particular day.

A party may rescind consent to e-mail service in a case by filing and serving a notice so  stating.    Documents sent by electronic mail (e-mail) will be accepted for filing with the Commission,  or deemed sufficient service on a hearing officer or party, if the following requirements are  met:    (i)   The document must be sent in Portable Document Format (PDF) as a file attachment  to an e-mail message.    For  documents  filed  with  the  Commission,  the  e-mail  must  be  sent  to  cchrfilings@cityofchicago.org, or to such other e-mail address designated for filings  as  appears  on  the  Commission’s  website,  in  a  conspicuous  posting  in  the  Commission’s office, or in the Commission’s latest notice or order issued in the case.   (ii)   (iii)   For documents served on a hearing officer, the e-mail must be sent to the e-mail  address for the hearing officer as provided in the order appointing the hearing officer  or in the Commission’s or hearing officer’s latest notice or order issued in the case.   (iv)   All other service or filing requirements must be met.   (v)   The  Commission  may,  by  standing  order  or  by  written  notice  to  the  parties  in  a  particular  case,  establish  additional  procedures  for  electronic  service  or  filing,  including signature or verification by electronic means.

25447`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/sites/settlement/ExecutedSettlementAgreement.pdf`Success`Success`37`10`Not a fillable PDF.`WHEREAS, on November 2, 2016, the Court certified the McKenzie-Lopez Lawsuit as a  class action, designated Delyn McKenzie-Lopez and Erica Lieschke as the class representatives  and appointed Myron M. Cherry and Jacie C. Zolna of Myron M. Cherry & Associates, LLC as  class counsel (“Class Counsel”);     WHEREAS,  the  Parties  have  engaged  in  written  discovery,  exchanged  document   productions, conducted depositions and engaged in a substantial amount of other discovery;     WHEREAS, the Parties have conferred on numerous occasions over the past year in an   effort to reach a settlement of this dispute;     WHEREAS, the terms and conditions of the settlement set forth herein were reached after  extensive, bona fide, arm’s length negotiations among the Parties by their respective attorneys and  other representatives;     WHEREAS, the Parties have investigated the facts and have analyzed the relevant legal  issues  with  regard  to  the  claims  and  defenses  asserted  in  the  Lawsuits.    Based  on  these  investigations, Plaintiffs believe the Lawsuits have merit while the City believes the Lawsuits have  no merit and denies all liability.  The Parties have also each looked at the uncertainties of trial and  the benefits to be obtained under the proposed settlement, and have considered the costs, risks, and  delays associated with the continued prosecution of this complex litigation, and the likely appeals  of any rulings in favor of either Plaintiffs or the City.  After undertaking this investigation and  analysis, Class Counsel believes that it is in the best interest of Class Members to enter into this  Agreement;     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  representations,  covenants  and  promises  contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency  of which are hereby confessed and acknowledged as evidenced by the execution of this Agreement,  the Parties agree as follows:                      II.   CLASS RELIEF   1.   Settlement Fund:  The City shall create a fund on behalf of Class Members in the  amount of thirty-eight million seven-hundred fifty thousand dollars ($38,750,000) (the “Settlement  Fund”).  The Settlement Fund shall consist of twenty-six million seven-hundred fifty thousand  dollars ($26,750,000) in cash and twelve million dollars ($12,000,000) in the extinguishment of  debt on amounts owed to the City by Class Members on alleged ASE and ATL violations that are  the subject of the McKenzie-Lopez Lawsuit.     2.   Class Member Payments and Debt Extinguishment:     a.   Each  Class  Member  who  does  not  elect  to  be  excluded  pursuant  to  Paragraph 23 below shall be eligible under this Agreement for a cash payment of up to fifty  percent (50%) of all fines, penalties and other amounts paid by or collected from said Class  Member on alleged ASE or ATL violations that are the subject of the McKenzie-Lopez  Lawsuit (the “Class Member Payment”).  2                                b.   Each  Class  Member  who  does  not  elect  to  be  excluded  pursuant  to  Paragraph 23 below shall be eligible under this Agreement for the extinguishment of up to  fifty percent (50%) of all unpaid or uncollected fines, penalties and other amounts owed  by  said  Class  Member  on  alleged  ASE  or  ATL  violations  that  are  the  subject  of  the  McKenzie-Lopez Lawsuit (the “Class Member Debt Extinguishment”).   c.   The amounts refunded pursuant to this Paragraph 2 shall be paid from the  cash portion of the Settlement Fund.  To the extent the amount of Class Member Payments  claimed under this Paragraph, plus the applicable amounts refunded under Paragraphs 3-4  below and the attorneys’ fees and costs awarded to Class Counsel, exceed $26,750,000 in  cash, the amount of Class Member Payments to each Class Member will be reduced on a  pro rata basis so that the total amount paid by the City under this Paragraph, inclusive of  the applicable amounts refunded under Paragraphs 3-4 below and the attorneys’ fees and  costs  awarded  to  Class  Counsel,  equals  $26,750,000  in  cash.    The  amount  of  debt  extinguished under this Paragraph 2 shall be taken from the debt portion of the Settlement  Fund.  To the extent the amount of Class Member Debt Extinguishment claimed under this  Paragraph exceeds $12,000,000, the amount of the Class Member Debt Extinguishment for  each Class Member will be reduced on a pro rata basis so that the total amount of debt  extinguished by the City under this Paragraph equals $12,000,000.   d.   In  order  to  receive  a  Class  Member  Payment  or  Class  Member  Debt  Extinguishment, a Class Member must complete the Claim Form or Hearing Option Claim  Form sent with the Notice as described in Paragraphs 12.a and 12.b below, or submit a  claim  online  at  the  website  described  in  Paragraph  14  below.    The  deadline  for  Class  Members  to  submit  a  claim  for  a  Class  Member  Payment  or  Class  Member  Debt  Extinguishment shall be fifty-six (56) days after the deadline for Notice to be sent pursuant  to Paragraph 12 below.  A claim shall be timely filed if postmarked or submitted online on  or before the deadline for submission of claims.    3.   Opportunity for Full Refunds and/or Debt Extinguishment:   a.   This  Settlement  recognizes  that  certain  Class  Members  have  already  requested hearings pursuant to the Review and Refund Ordinance. Class Members who  have requested a hearing pursuant to the Review and Refund Ordinance, but who prefer to  submit a claim for a Class Member Payment or Class Member Debt Extinguishment, may  do  so  by  submitting  a  claim  in  the  manner  specified  in  this  Agreement  in  lieu  of  the  requested hearing.  If such a Class Member submits a claim for a Class Member Payment  or Class Member Debt Extinguishment for a particular violation subject to the McKenzie- Lopez Lawsuit, the Class Member shall waive his or her right to a hearing pursuant to the  Review and Refund ordinance.  However, this waiver shall only apply to a hearing on the  particular  violation  upon  which  the  Class  Member  submits  a  claim  and  has  previously  requested  a  hearing.    If  a  Class  Member  has  previously  requested  a  hearing  under  the  Review and Refund Ordinance on a particular violation, but does not timely submit a claim  for  a  Class  Member  Payment  or  Class  Member  Debt  Extinguishment  on  that  same   3                      violation, the hearing on that violation for which a hearing was previously requested shall  be scheduled and proceed without any further action by the Class Member.      b.   For any Class Member who proceeds with a hearing under the Review and  Refund Ordinance and prevails as to an alleged violation, the City shall give that Class  Member a full refund of any amounts paid or collected on the alleged violation and/or  extinguish all amounts owed on the alleged violation.  Where a Class Member proceeds to  a hearing, the City shall mail a copy of the administrative decision to the Class Member  within seven (7) days of the entry of that decision.  This Agreement explicitly contemplates  that some Class Members are subject to multiple alleged violations and that they may seek  a  Class  Member  Payment  or  Class  Member  Extinguishment  on  one  or  more  alleged  violations  while  pursuing  hearings  under  the  Review  and  Refund  Ordinance  on  other  violations.   c.   Other than as set forth in Paragraph 3.d. below, any amounts refunded to  Class Members under this Paragraph 3 shall be paid from the cash portion of the Settlement  Fund  and  shall  be  considered  to  determine  whether  pro  rata  shares  for  Class  Member  Payments  and  Class  Member  Debt  Extinguishment  are  required  under  Paragraph  2.c.  above.  Any amount of debt extinguished under this Paragraph 3 will not count toward or  come out of the Settlement Fund, but instead will constitute relief separate from and in  addition to the Settlement Fund.   d.   The administrative decisions on the hearings that take place pursuant to this  Paragraph 3 shall be rendered within one hundred seventy-five (175) days after the deadline  for Class Members to submit a claim for a Class Member Payment or Class Member Debt  Extinguishment  (the  “Administrative  Decision Deadline”).    The  distribution  of  refunds  pursuant to this Paragraph that will be paid from the cash portion of the Settlement Fund  shall be determined solely from, and be limited to, final administrative decisions that are  rendered by the Administrative Decision Deadline.  If any administrative or judicial review  is taken from an administrative decision issued pursuant to this Paragraph, or if for any  reason an administrative decision is not rendered by the Administrative Decision Deadline,  the  City  shall  be  responsible  for  any  refunds  that  may  result  from  those  hearings  or  proceedings separate from and in addition to the cash portion of the Settlement Fund (i.e.,  any such refunds will not count toward or come out of the Settlement Fund).   4.   Refund  of  Late  Payment  Penalty:    A  Late  Payment  Penalty  Claim  Form  as  described in Paragraph 12.c below shall also be sent with the Notice to any Class Member who on  or after July 1, 2012 and up to and including May 31, 2015 paid an ASE or ATL fine within twenty- five (25) days of the determination of liability and was charged a late payment penalty that was  paid or collected (the “Eligible Late Payment Penalty”).  A Class Member who submits this claim,  either by mail or online at the website described in Paragraph 14 below, shall be entitled to a refund  of the entire amount of the Eligible Late Payment Penalty (the “Late Payment Penalty Refund”),  which amount shall be paid from the cash portion of the Settlement Fund and shall be considered  to determine whether pro rata shares for Class Member Payments are required under Paragraph  2.c. above.  The deadline for Class Members to submit a claim for a Late Payment Penalty Refund  shall be fifty-six (56) days after the deadline for Notice to be sent pursuant to Paragraph 12 below.           4       5.   Additional Relief:                              A  claim  shall  be  timely  filed  if  postmarked  or  submitted  online  on  or  before  the  deadline  for  submission of claims.     a.   Review and Refund Ordinance: The City agrees and acknowledges that  the Review and Refund Ordinance was passed in response to the McKenzie-Lopez Lawsuit  and that the benefits provided to Class Members under the Review and Refund Ordinance,  including, but not limited to, being given another opportunity to contest their ASE and  ATL violations and the total amount of all refunds issued and debt extinguished under the  Review and Refund Ordinance, are directly attributable to the McKenzie-Lopez Lawsuit  and the efforts of Class Counsel.   b.   No Immobilization or Impoundment, or Driver’s License Suspension:   The City agrees that no Class Member’s ASE or ATL violation that was subject to the  McKenzie-Lopez  Lawsuit  will  be  used  to  determine  whether  a  vehicle  is  eligible  for  immobilization or impoundment, or driver’s license suspension.   c.   Debt Relief Program:  The City shall implement a debt relief program for  Class Members who pay the fine for an ASE or ATL violation subject to the McKenzie- Lopez Lawsuit (including any amount of the fine remaining after a Class Member Debt  Extinguishment pursuant to Paragraph 2 above) and apply for debt relief within thirty (30)  days of the issuance of a confirmation of liability on the violation under the Review and  Refund Ordinance, or within thirty (30) days of the final order disposing of any timely- filed action seeking administrative or judicial review of that confirmation of liability.  For  all  such  Class  Members,  the  City  shall:  (i)  waive  all  previously-assessed  late  payment  penalties, interest, collection fees, and collection costs for that violation, and (ii) not seek  civil or criminal prosecution against the Class Member for the failure to pay fines, interest,  fees, costs or penalties for that violation.  The debt extinguished under this Paragraph will  not count toward or come out of the Settlement Fund, but instead will constitute relief  separate from and in addition to the Settlement Fund.   d.   Additional  Debt  Extinguishment:    If  the  only  debt  owed  by  a  Class  Member for an ASE or ATL violation subject to the McKenzie-Lopez Lawsuit is for late  payment penalties or collection fees, the City will forgive and extinguish such penalties or  fees.  The debt extinguished under this Paragraph will not count toward or come out of the  Settlement Fund, even if such a Class Member also submits a claim for a Class Member  Debt Extinguishment, but instead will constitute relief separate from and in addition to the  Settlement Fund.  For sake of clarity, if the only debt owed by a Class Member for an ASE  or ATL violation subject to the McKenzie-Lopez Lawsuit is for a late payment penalty or  collection  fees  and  that  Class  Member  submits  a  claim  for  a  Class  Member  Debt  Extinguishment  on  that  violation,  the  extinguishment  of  the  late  payment  penalty  and  collection fees on that violation will not count toward or come out of the Settlement Fund,  but instead will be extinguished separate from and in addition to the Settlement Fund.   5                   6.   7.   e.   Change In Notice and Late Payment Penalty Practices:    As referenced  in Recitals, the City changed its notice and late payment penalty practices in May of 2015  to conform those practices with the MCC.  The City agrees and acknowledges that these  changes were made as a direct result of the McKenzie-Lopez Lawsuit and the efforts of  Class Counsel.  In addition to the relief set forth above, the City further acknowledges and  agrees that it will follow the then current MCC ATL and ASE requirements in its continued  enforcement of the ATL and ASE programs.   f.   Paragraph 5.   The  City  takes  no  position  on  the  value  of  the  benefits  set  forth  in  this   III.   FUNDING AND TIMING OF SETTLEMENT   Timing of Class Member Payments and Late Payment Penalty Refunds:  The  City shall begin mailing the Class Member Payments and Late Payment Penalty Refunds to Class  Members within twenty-eight (28) days after the Final Settlement Date or within twenty-eight (28)  days  after  the  date  by  which  Class  Counsel  is  to  receive  the  Hearing  Report  as  described  in  Paragraph 19 below, whichever is later, and all such mailing shall be completed no later than forty- nine (49) days thereafter. The Final Settlement Date shall be the thirty-first (31st) day after the  Court enters a final and appealable order and/or judgment approving this Agreement (the “Final  Approval Order”), but only if there is no appeal taken from the Final Approval Order.  If an appeal  is taken from the Final Approval Order, the Final Settlement Date shall be the date on which a  reviewing court either affirms the Final Approval Order or denies review and (i) all avenues of  appeal and/or rehearing have been exhausted, or (ii) the time for seeking further appeals and/or a  petition for rehearing has expired.     Deadline  for  Class  Members  to  Cash  Checks  for  Class  Member  Payment  and/or Late Payment Penalty Refund:  Class Members shall have sixty (60) days from the date  a Class Member Payment and/or Late Payment Penalty Refund check is dated in which to cash or  deposit the check.  No later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the last Class Member  Payment and/or Late Payment Penalty Refund check is dated to Class Members, the City shall  cancel all checks that remain un-negotiated and re-issue checks for Class Member Payments and/or  Late  Payment  Penalty  Refunds  to  all  Class  Members  who  did  not  negotiate  their  initial  Class  Member Payment and/or Late Payment Penalty Refund check.  Such Class Members shall have  sixty (60) days from the date those checks are dated in which to cash or deposit them.  Class  Members who do not cash or deposit the re-issued check within sixty (60) days shall be deemed  to  have  waived  their  right  to  receive  a  Class  Member  Payment  and/or  Late  Payment  Penalty  Refund.  Any amount remaining from an uncashed or un-deposited check for a Class Member  Payment and/or Late Payment Penalty Refund shall return to the City’s General Fund.     Timing  of  Class  Member  Debt  Extinguishment:    Within  forty-two  (42)  days  after the Final Settlement Date, the City shall extinguish and release all debt for which a valid  claim was submitted for a Class Member Debt Extinguishment and take all steps necessary to  ensure  that  all  such  debt  extinguishment  is  communicated  to  any  third-party  responsible  for  collecting any such debt.     8.          6       IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS   COUNTY DEPARTMENT, CHANCERY DIVISION   DELYN MCKENZIE-LOPEZ, et al.,                                                   Plaintiffs,                                        v.

IT RELATES    TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTIONS AND   CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS.   You are eligible for a settlement payment and/or other relief if you sign and return the enclosed   claim form(s) or if you submit a claim online at [INSERT WEBSITE ADDRESS].    What is this notice about?   I.    This Notice is being sent to notify you of two class action lawsuits against the City of Chicago (the “City”)  relating to its operation and enforcement of its speed and red light camera program (the “Lawsuits”).  On  [insert date], 2017, the Court preliminarily approved a settlement of the Lawsuits.  The purpose of this  Notice is to inform you of the Lawsuits and the proposed settlement.  In addition, this Notice will advise  you of what to do if you want to remain a part of the Lawsuits, what to do if you want to exclude yourself  from the Lawsuits and how joining or not joining the Lawsuits may affect your legal rights.    II.  What are the Lawsuits about?    On March 23, 2015, a class action lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, presently  entitled McKenzie-Lopez, et al. v. City of Chicago, Case No. 15 CH 4802 (the “McKenzie-Lopez Lawsuit”).   The McKenzie-Lopez Lawsuit alleged that the City failed to provide motorists with the notice they were  entitled  to  under  the  Municipal  Code  of  Chicago  (the  “MCC”),  unlawfully  accelerated  liability  determinations  and  prematurely  assessed  late  penalties  in  connection  with  alleged  speed  and  red  light  camera violations.  Among other things, the Lawsuit sought to void the fines, penalties and other amounts  assessed in connection with these violations.  The City denies the allegations and asserts that the violations,  determinations of liability, fines and penalties, and the photographic and video evidence maintained by the  City in support of its determinations of liability are valid.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,815 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Brandon Avenue, from E.  83rd Street to 134’ South of E. 85th Street, and in S. Baker Avenue, from E. 83rd Place to S.  Brandon Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Holmes’ office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Natashia Holmes               7th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1              Do you wonder what was happening in 1890?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:          CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                              WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION       Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing  2,815 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Brandon Avenue, from E. 83rd Street to 134’ South of E. 85th Street, and in S.  Baker Avenue, from E. 83rd Place to S, Brandon Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in July. Final restoration will follow in August. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN NATASHIA HOLMES   773-731-7777       PETE SCALES – DEPARTMENT OF WATER MANAGEMENT   312-744-8822                             FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in July. Final  restoration will follow in August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at  the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

By late July 2017, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 537 feet of new 8-inch and 262 feet of new 12-inch  water main in W. 105th Place, from S. Church Street to S. Vincennes Avenue and S. Vincennes  Avenue, from W. 103rd Street to W. 107th Street. The old water main dates back to 1896, and needs  to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  34th Ward Office: 773-928-6961  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

CDPH and partners  throughout the state will be reminding the public and healthcare providers about  the importance of continuing to vaccinate throughout the fall and winter months.   On Saturday, December 2nd, CDPH will be offering influenza vaccinations for no  out-out-pocket cost at Kennedy King College (6301 S. Halsted St.) from 9AM  until 2PM.                                                                                         Vaccination is the best way to protect against influenza infection and all Chicagoans aged six months and older are  encouraged to get vaccinated.  Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine  availability.  For those without a healthcare provider or whose healthcare providers do not have the influenza  vaccine, a schedule of City of Chicago influenza vaccination clinics2 is available on the City website and by calling  311.  To locate the closest City of Chicago clinic or retail pharmacy, go to www.chicagoflushots.org.                                 What is the risk?   Currently, the risk of influenza infection is low.                                                                                                                                Figure 1.  Number of influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations  reported for Chicago residents, for the current season (2017-2018)  and previous season, October-May.   Are severe cases of influenza occurring?                                                                                                                       For the week of November 19-25, 2017, four  influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were  reported; all were positive for influenza A (3 H3N2  and 1 not subtyped) (Figure 1).       Which influenza strains are circulating?                                                                                                                                 Data on influenza virus test results are reported by  Chicago laboratories performing influenza RT-PCR.  For the week of November 19-25, 2017, with 6  laboratories reporting, 10 of the 544 (1.8%)  specimens tested for influenza were positive for  influenza A (8 H3N2 and 2 unknown subtype) (Figure  2).     Since October 1, 2017, 36 of 4,304 (<1%) specimens  tested for influenza have been positive; 33 typed as  influenza A (24 H3N2, 9 unknown subtype [subtyping  not performed or not all subtypes tested]) and three  typed as influenza B.       Figure 2. Percent of specimens testing positive (by RT-PCR) for  influenza by subtype as reported by local laboratories serving  Chicago hospitals, for the current season (2017-2018) October-May.   How much influenza-like illness is occurring?                                                                                        CDPH receives data from several hospitals in  Chicago that provide emergent care, which report  on a weekly basis the total number of emergency  department visits, and of those visits, the number  with influenza-like illness (fever of 100°F or greater  and cough and/or sore throat).     For the week of November 19-25, 2017, with seven  hospitals reporting, 2.6% of emergency department  visits were due to ILI (Figure 3).       In addition to emergency departments, several  outpatient clinics throughout Chicago participate in  CDC’s Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) by also reporting on a weekly basis the total number of  outpatient clinic visits, and of those visits, the number with influenza-like illness (ILI).  For the week of November  19-25, 2017, with 22 facilities reporting, 2.4% of outpatient clinic visits were due to influenza-like illness (Figure 4).     1https://www.chicagohan.org/ViewsFlash/servlet/viewsflash?cmd=showform&pollid=IMMZ!IMMZVoucher2017; 2https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/ supp_info/health-protection/2017-influenza-walk-in-clinic-schedule.html   Page  1 of 2  All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.       ESSENCE is an electronic syndromic surveillance system  used to monitor influenza-like illness by utilizing the chief  complaints of patients visiting emergency departments.   Currently, all Chicago hospitals submit data to  ESSENCE on a daily basis, covering every emergency  department visit in the city.    Figure 3. Percent of emergency department visits attributed to  influenza-like illness based on manual reports by individual  hospitals, Chicago, by week, for the current season (2017-2018)  and previous three seasons, October-May.   For the week of November 19-25, 2017, 496 of the  22,487 (2.2%) emergency department visits among the  59 Chicago zip codes analyzed were due to influenza- like illness (ILI).  Among age groups, children under  five years of age had the highest percentage of visits  due to influenza-like illness at 10.0%, followed by  those 5-17 years of age at 4.1%; those 18-44, 45-64,  and 65 and older were at 1% or less.     Figure 5 represents the percentage of emergency  department visits due to influenza-like illness  aggregated by patient zip code.  For the week of  November 19-25, 2017, 40 of 59 (68%) zip codes had  ILI activity levels in the minimal to low categories and 19  (32%) had ILI activity levels in the moderate to high  categories; the median percent ILI was 1.7% with a  range from <1% to 13% (Figure 6).

Where can I get more information?                                                                                                                        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  FluView2 report provides national updates and trends  related to the intensity of influenza activity across the  United States, as well as detailed information on  antiviral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics.  Updates specific to Illinois3 and Suburban Cook County4  are also available online.  Current and archived issues  of the Chicago Flu Update can be found on the CDPH  website section Current Flu Situation in Chicago5.                                                                                                                 *ILI Activity Level:               ILI percentage for each zip  code for the current week is  compared to the mean ILI  percentage during the non- influenza months (May 21,  2017-September 30,2017);  level 1 corresponds to an  ILI percentage below the  mean, level 2 to an ILI  percentage less than one  standard deviation (SD)  above the mean, level 3 to  an ILI percentage more  than one, but less than two  SDs above mean, and so  on, with level 10  corresponding to an ILI  percentage eight or more  SDs above the mean.
