This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local  government with you, our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are  well informed about the project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or  concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing a new sewer main in S. Cottage Grove Avenue, from E. 79th  Street to E. 77th Street. The old pipe dates back to 1906, and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Sawyer’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Roderick T.

That’s the year the old sewer main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       BUGSY SIEGEL        Kellogg’s Corn Flakes were made available to the general public.    SOS became an international distress symbol.    President Theodore Roosevelt left for a trip to Panama to inspect the construction   progress of the Panama Canal. This was the first time a sitting American President made  an official trip outside of the United States.    The first animated cartoon was copyrighted.    Albert Einstein introduced his Theory of Relativity.    The muffuletta sandwich was invented in New Orleans.    American gangster Bugsy Siegel was born.                                                    24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      ALDERMAN RODERICK T. SAWYER   3-1-1            773-635-0006   312-742-1021            PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will install a new sewer main in S. Cottage  Grove Avenue, from E. 79th Street to E. 77th Street.     Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1906 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by 77th  Street on the north, 79th Street on the south, and Cottage Grove Avenue on the east/west benefit  from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Installation of the new sewer will begin shortly, with completion anticipated for May  2012. Restoration of the damaged streets/parkways will follow. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic and Parking: This project will require the closure of all northbound traffic lanes from  just south of 79th Street to 77th Street. North and southbound traffic will be maintained in the  southbound traffic and curb lanes, necessitating continuous ""No Parking"" posting on the west  side of Cottage Grove from 79th to 77th for the duration of the project. The east side will be  posted ""No Parking"" during working hours only. We are agreeable to parking outside of those  hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start of the next workday. Safety is our  highest priority, but you will always be able to reach your home or business.         CONTACT NUMBERS   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Sawyer, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.             Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!            "

Pursuant  to  chapter  4-236  of  the  Chicago  Municipal  Code,  the  Chicago  Parking Lot and Garage Operations Tax (the “parking tax” or “tax”) is imposed upon the  use and privilege of parking a motor vehicle in or upon any parking lot or garage in the  City of Chicago.  Under Section 4-236-020(c), the tax does not apply to residential off- street  parking  of  house  or  apartment  tenants  or  condominiums  required  by  the  City  of  Chicago Zoning Ordinance, wherein an arrangement for such parking is provided in the  house or apartment lease or in a separate writing between the landlord or tenant, or if in a  condominium between the condominium association and the owner, occupant or guest of  a unit, whether the parking charge is payable to the landlord, condominium association,  or to the operator of the parking lot or garage.    Section 2.  To claim the exemption set forth in subsection 020(c), the landlord/operator  must maintain supporting documentation.  If called upon by the Department of Revenue,  the landlord/operator will be required to substantiate the claim by producing the lease,  separate writing or other supporting documents.  Failure to provide proof acceptable to  the Department will bar the landlord/operator from claiming this exemption, in which  case the landlord/operator will be liable for the unpaid tax, plus interest and applicable  penalties.

That on February 10, 2006, the Licensee was not the beneficial owner of   the business operated on the licensed premises, in violation of  Title 4,   Chapter 60, 030 (r).    That on or about February 10, 2006, a change occurred in the officers,   directors, managers or shareholders of the Licensee, and the Licensee   failed to notify such changes to the Department of Business Affairs and   Consumer Protection, with (30) days of that change, in violation of Title 4,  Chapter 60, 060 (c) of the Municipal Code of Chicago.     That on or about September 5, 2008, the Licensee engaged, employed, or   permitted a person under the age of 21 years to work in or upon the   licensed premises where the principal business is the sale of alcoholic   liquor, while such premises was open for the sale at retail of alcoholic   liquor, in violation of Title 4, Chapter 60, Section 140 of the Municipal   Code of Chicago.    The matter was heard on April 16, 2010, May 14, 2010, June 25, 2010, and July   9,  2010.    Dan  Rubinow  and  David  Frueh  represented  the  City  and  the  Licensee  was   represented  by  Jeffrey  Deer  of  the  law  firm  of  Deer,  Stone  &  Maya,  P.C.    Deputy   Hearing Commissioner Stratton entered Findings of Fact that the City met its burden of   proof on Charges 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 and further finding in light of the present violations   and the Licensee’s prior disciplinary history that revocation was the appropriate penalty   (Counts 3 and 7 were withdrawn by the City before the end of the hearing).  The Licensee   filed a timely appeal before this Commission.          Since this case deals with an appeal of a revocation of a liquor license review by   this Commission is limited to these questions:                  a.   Whether the local liquor control commissioner has proceeded in      the manner proved by law;        b.   Whether the order is supported by the findings;   2              c.     Whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in light   of the whole record.       A review of the applicable sections of the State Statute and the Municipal Code    will aid in understanding this decision.          235 ILCS (a)(i) states in relevant part that “No licensee nor any officer, associate,   member, representative, agent or employee of such licensee shall sell, give, or deliver   alcoholic liquor to any person under the age of 21 years.”         235 ILCS 5/6-2 (a)(15) prohibits the issuance of a liquor license to “A person who   is not a beneficial owner of the business to be operated by the licensee.”             Title 4, Chapter 60, Section 140 (a) of the Municipal Code states that “It shall be   unlawful for any licensee or any officer, associate, member, representative, agent or   employee of such licensee to sell, give or deliver alcoholic liquor to any person under the   age of 21 years.”          Title 4, Chapter 60, Section 030 (r) bars the issuance of a license for the sale of   alcoholic liquor to “A person who is not the beneficial owner of the business to be   operated by the licensee.”          3      Title 4, Chapter 60, Section 060 (c) requires that “whenever any changes occur in   the officers of the licensee, the licensee shall notify the Department of Business Affairs   and Licensing…”  This section goes on to explain the notification procedures.          Title 4, Chapter 60, Section 140 states that “It shall also be unlawful for any   person licensed pursuant to this chapter to engage or employ or permit any person under   the age of 21 to work…upon the licensed premises where the principal business is the   sale of alcoholic liquor.”          Tyrone Jackson has been a Chicago Police Officer for 20 years and has been   assigned to the SAM unit of the Organized Crime Division for ten years.  SAM stands for   “Stop Alcohol to Minors” and his duties in that unit include taking minors that are   employed by the City of Chicago to liquor license establishments to see if alcohol is   being sold to minors at those locations.          He was working in that capacity on April 3, 2009.  His shift started at 5:00 p.m.   when he met with his partners and Grace Gallegos, the cooperating minor.  Prior to   leaving the staging area at Homan Square he obtained a $20.00 bill from the vice control   contingency fund and wrote the serial numbers off that bill onto his field notes.  He and   his partners had Grace Gallegos empty her pockets and put her personal items into a   plastic bag.  Once it was determined Grace had no personal items on her person he gave   Grace the prerecorded $20.00.          4      He and his crew drove in a covert vehicle to Zavala’s Liquors at 4218 S. Archer.    He was dressed in civilian clothes.  Grace Gallegos entered the storefront and he   followed after 15 to 20 seconds.  From a distance of 5 to 7 feet he observed Ms. Gallegos   take a six-pack of 16 ounce cans of Budweiser from the beer cooler and go to the   checkout line.          Ms. Gallegos placed the six 16 ounce cans on the counter and tendered to the   cashier, identified as a Sylvia Pineda, the prerecorded $20 bill.  The $20.00 bill was put   into the cash register and Ms. Gallegos took possession of the beer and $12.62 in change.    He heard no conversation between Ms. Gallegos and Ms. Pineda.  He then identified   himself as a police officer and retrieved the $20 bill from the cash register.  He returned   the $12.62 in change to Ms. Pineda.  The $20 bill retrieved from the cash register was the   same bill previously recorded.  He described Budweiser as an alcoholic beer and stated   the beer was inventoried pursuant to Chicago Police procedures.          Grace Gallegos was born on April 3, 1991, and was 18 years old on April 3, 2009.    She has worked for the Chicago Police on the SAM unit since January, 2009.  She was   working with the SAM unit on April 3, 2009.  She was dressed in civilian clothes and   was working with Officer Jackson.  Before she left the staging area at Homan Square, she   emptied everything out of her pockets in front of Officer Jackson.  She put everything   into a clear plastic bag and Jackson gave her a marked $20.00 bill.  They went to    Zavala’s Liquor Store at 4218 S. Archer.  She entered the liquor store and Officer   Jackson followed.  She went to the cooler and got a six-pack of Budweiser.  She brought      5   the beer to the counter and handed the marked $20 bill to the person located behind the   counter.  The person behind the counter rang up the sale, bagged the beer and gave her   back the change.  Officer Jackson then identified himself.  The woman behind the counter   did not ask what her birthday was, did not ask how old she was and did not ask for I.D.    Gallegos did not offer any I.D.  Gallegos was 18 years old on the date of this incident but   admitted most people think she was older in her 20’s.          Michael Panico has been a Chicago Police Officer for about 17 years and has   been assigned to the vice control section of the Organized Crime Division for about 11   years.  Part of his duties include investigations of licensed liquor establishments.  In this   position, in September 2008, he was assigned to be part of an investigation into a   Zavala’s Liquors at 4218 S. Archer.  To prepare for this investigation he checked the   IRIS computer system used by the City of Chicago for licenses and determined that entity   on record as being the sole officer of the corporate entity that held this liquor license was   Rafael Zavala.  The legal name of the corporation was Rafael Zavala, Inc.  It held a   packaged goods license, a tobacco license and a limited business license.           He also checked a database called Accurint to determine the deed holder of the   property at 4218 S. Archer.  The deed holder was then Mr. Pineda and the previous deed   holder was Rafael Zavala.          The witness went to the 4218 S. Archer location on September 5, 2008, with his   two partners Brian Cavanaugh and Robert Murphy. They were dressed in plain clothes      6      City’s Exhibit 12, the birth certificate of Edwin Pineda showing a date of birth of   August 12, 1990, was allowed in evidence without objection.          Sylvia Pineda was present on April 3, 2009, when a ticket was issued for selling   liquor to a minor.  She sold the liquor to a woman about 5’ 3” that she thought was at   least 23.  If somebody looks under 21 she asks for the I.D.  She did not think it was   necessary to ask for an I.D. because she looked over 21.          There has been no argument made that the Local Liquor Control Commissioner   did not proceed in the manner provided by law.  Respondent had due and adequate notice   of the date, time and location of the hearing and of the charges filed against it.    Respondent had the opportunity to present evidence and to confront the witnesses   testifying against him.          With respect to Charges 1 and 2 alleging a sale of alcoholic beverage to a minor   as violations of the applicable sections of the State Statute and Municipal Code the   respondent did not assert a defense denying that the alleged sale occurred.  Counsel for   respondent asserted that there is no state law or City of Chicago Municipal Ordinance   that imposes a mandatory obligation to card everyone that does buy liquor.  That is a   correct statement of the law but that does negate the fact that a sale of alcohol was made   to a minor.  Counsel also hinted at an entrapment defense based on the fact that the minor   looked over 21.  Entrapment is a defense in criminal law but this Commissioner is not   aware of any case law that would support the position that it is a defense in administrative      8   hearings.  Even assuming it could be a defense the facts in this case would not support an   entrapment defense.  The City has met its burden of proof in that there is more than   substantial evidence in the whole record to support the findings on Counts 1 and 2.          Count 8 alleged that the respondent engaged, employed or permitted a person   under the age of 21 to work on the licensed premises where the principal business is the   sale of alcoholic liquors.  Counsel for the City argued that Edwin Pineda, who was a   minor in September, 2008, identified himself to the police as the manager.  The transcript   shows there was a substantial objection to the question that seemed to be leading to such   a statement.  No such admission or statement that he was the manager is in the record.    The only evidence on this issue comes from a statement from the counter-person,   Guadalupe Salazar, that Edwin Pineda was the manager and could answer questions and   give contact information.  Substantial evidence has been defined very broadly and that   standard is met if there is any evidence in the record supporting the finding.  Even with   very law threshold the City did not meet its burden of proof on this count.  There was   nothing on the record that defined what the witness meant by the term manager or what   responsibilities Edwin had in the running of the store. Without some other evidence, the   statement by Guadalupe that Edwin was the manager was not sufficient to meet the   substantial evidence standard.  The finding as to Count 8 in the Amended Notice of   Hearing is reversed.          As set out earlier with the State Statute and the Municipal Code bars the issuance   of a liquor license to a person who is not the beneficial owner of the business to be      9   operated by the licensee.  A violation of these laws was alleged in Counts 4 and 5 of the   Amended Notice of Hearing.  The license of these premises at all times relevant to this   case was in the name of Rafael Zavala, Inc.  Officer Panico testified Mr. Zavala was the   President and Secretary of that corporation and City’s Exhibit 6, in evidence without   objection, confirmed Mr. Zavala was the President.  This information was obtained in his   investigation that started in September of 2008.           Officer Panico’s investigation of property records revealed a sale of the property   at 4218 S. Archer from Mr. Zavala to Ruben Pineda on March 21, 2006.  Panico also   testified to an October 16 conversation with an individual who identified himself as   Rafael Zavala.  That individual stated he was not the owner of Zavala Liquors and that he   had sold the business approximately two years before.  Panico identified City’s Exhibit   11, in evidence without objection, as the Purchase Agreement and a cover letter from Mr.   Zavala’s attorney.  (In fact the document is entitled RIDER TO STOCK PURCHASE   AGREEMENT, the stock purchase agreement was not placed in evidence)  The letter   dated August 14, 2008, from attorney Richard Wojnarowski to attorney Robert Weber   recites that Mr. Pineda, Weber’s client, is trying to secure a liquor license in his own   name. That letter adds that Weber’s client, Mr. Pineda, has been operating the liquor store   using his client’s name.  The Rider to Stock Purchase Agreement is not dated but it states   that Ruben Pineda, the buyer, upon payment of $100,000 on February 10, 2006, will be   allowed to run the liquor store and keep all of the profits until the liquor license is   transferred.           10

Hairston’s (5th Ward) request, I am providing you with information  regarding a water construction project in your neighborhood. This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 983 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Greenwood Avenue, from  E. Hyde Park Boulevard to E. 53rd Street. The old pipe dates back to 1905, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Hairston’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:                HOWARD HUGHES     Las Vegas, Nevada was founded.    Franklin D. Roosevelt married his fiancée Eleanor in New York.    Bus timetables were printed for the first time.    Pocket clips were added to fountain pens.    American aviator, engineer, industrialist, film producer and director Howard Hughes was   born.     Albert Einstein published four papers; 1905 is regarded as his “Miracle Year”.                               GREENWOOD AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 983 feet of 8-inch water  main in S. Greenwood Avenue, from E. Hyde Park Boulevard to E. 53rd Street.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1905 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by mid June 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Greenwood Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      ALDERMAN LESLIE A. HAIRSTON    ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   3-1-1   773- 324-5555   312-742-1021                                                    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid June 2013.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Joe Moreno        1st Ward                                                     Do you wonder what was happening in 1872? That’s the year the old water main was  installed beneath your street. Among other things:                VICTORIA WOODHULL        Bloomingdale’s department store opened in New York City.    Thomas J. Martin patented the fire extinguisher.    Charlotte Ray, the first African American female lawyer, graduated from Harvard   University.     Arbor Day was celebrated for the first time, in Nebraska.    The Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College began its first academic session.   The university was later renamed Virginia Tech.     Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to be nominated for President of the   United States, although she was a year too young to quality and did not appear on  the ballot.                  PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,214 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Wood Street, from W. Augusta Boulevard to W. Chicago Avenue, in W. Iowa  Street, from N. Honore Street to N. Wood Street, and in W. Rice Street, from N. Wolcott  Avenue to N. Wood Street.         Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  main dates back to 1872 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late June 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Wood, Iowa, and Rice outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.  .   Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1            ALDERMAN JOE MORENO   773-278-0101            ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late June 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.
