Encompassing more than 3.5 square miles, the community is one of 77 community areas in the city and includes the neighborhoods of Logan Square, Palmer Square and Bucktown.  As one of Chicago’s most densely developed areas, Logan Square has the least amount of open space per capita of any Chicago community area except South Lawndale. The majority of its open space is along wide, tree-lined boulevards bordered by grand homes and  apartment  buildings,  many  dating  to  the  early  decades  of  the  20th  century.  Tightly  spaced  working-class homes of similar vintage fill other residential blocks, while the area’s commercial corridors are lined with shops, banks and small businesses. Acreage for traditional open spaces, such as parks and ball fields, is well below mini- mum standards.  To improve the quantity and quality of open space in the community, the Logan Square Open Space Plan identi- fies several opportunities, including the development of a recreational trail along an abandoned rail line, creative use of open space near the Kennedy Expressway, and improvements that restore the historic integrity and usabil- ity of both Logan and Palmer squares.  The plan was created through the close collaboration of community residents and businesses with the City of Chicago’s Department of Planning and Development (DPD), the Chicago Park District (CPD) and the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT). When implemented, over fifteen acres of new open space prescribed by the plan, in addition to facility enhancements at existing locations, will provide residents with increased recre- ational opportunities and also improve the aesthetics of the Logan Square community.  Sincerely,  Richard M. Daley Mayor  1  L o g a n   S q u a r e   O p e n   S p a c e   P l a n  History of the Logan Square Community Area  Early Settlement Logan Square’s first settlers took advantage of vast open spaces that characterized the Chicago region in the early 19th century. The first, Martin Nelson Kimbell, arrived in 1836 and established a 160-acre farm in the area bounded today by Fullerton, Diversey, Hamlin and Kimball avenues. In 1843, Justin Butterfield established an 80-acre farm in the area bounded today by Kedzie, Diversey and Milwaukee avenues. A wagon trail through the Kimbell property served as the initial catalyst for development. In 1848, the Northwest Plank Road Company surfaced the trail with three-inch thick boards, providing a direct link to both downtown Chicago and the city of Milwaukee, for which the road was eventu- ally named. Small businesses sprang up along the route and led to Logan Square’s first major growth spurt.   Portions of Logan Square were annexed into Jefferson Township in 1850 and the city of Chicago in 1863. The remain- der of the community was annexed by the city between 1887 and 1889. Water and sewer systems appeared soon after, along with more paved streets.  Rail and Streetcar Development The creation of the plank road on Milwaukee was the first in what would become a trend for Logan Square: Each new piece of transportation infrastructure precipitated change. By 1870, a Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad station near  Diversey  and  Rockwell  provided  direct  rail  connections  to  downtown  Chicago  and  Milwaukee.  In  1872,  the Chicago & Pacific Railroad started work on a grade-level freight and commuter line along what is today Bloomingdale Avenue. The line served numerous businesses, including coal and lumberyards, blacksmiths and tanneries, and provid- ed passenger boarding stations at Kimball and California avenues. By 1915, the line was raised above grade for safety and access purposes. Mostly inactive since the year 2000, the line forms the southern border of the Logan Square com- munity.  The establishment of electric cable cars on Milwaukee and the construction of an elevated rail line in 1895 further con- tributed to several decades of booming real estate growth associated with transportation improvements. A local period- ical reported the considerable interest in the community by thousands of potential residents because of Logan Square’s “most central position in the system.” Additional rail expansion continued through much of the century, including sta- tions for regional commuters at Armitage and Ashland avenues, and at Fullerton Avenue and Pulaski Road, before cul- minating in the late 1960s with the construction of a below-grade rapid transit station at Logan and Kedzie boulevards. It was designed by the late Myron Goldsmith of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.  Boulevards Logan Square possesses 2.5 miles of the city’s 26-mile boulevard system. Entered in the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, the system includes the community’s Humboldt, Kedzie, and Logan boulevards, as well as the formal Palmer Square and Logan Square, which serve as system focal points.    Lined with mostly high-end residential development, the boulevards represent 19th century planning initiatives to sep- arate work from play and businesses from residences. They were designed as pleasure drives linking regional parks, which created an impressive, leisurely landscape that complimented adjacent, majestic residences. Unlike other portions of the citywide boulevard system, Logan Square’s boulevards included multi-unit buildings designed in similar architectur- al styles as neighboring mansions. While the boulevards were residential in character, several churches and ornate com- mercial structures in Logan Square added to their civic and religious monumentality.    In the 1890s, the boulevards were improved with a classic, European form proposed by Fredrick Law Olmstead: a cen- tral carriage drive separated from side drives for delivery carts. In sharp contrast to the rest of the city where unimproved  3  L o g a n   S q u a r e   O p e n   S p a c e   P l a n  dirt roads were common, the boulevards provided carriage owners with a smooth and comfortable ride on compacted stone amid landscaped medians and formal lines of trees. The boulevards were also designed to accommodate public art, such as the Illinois Centennial Column commemorating the state’s 100th anniversary, at Logan and Kedzie boulevards.   In 1927, the boulevards were improved again with expanded grounds, landscaping, parking and, around Logan Square, electric  lighting.  Other  improvements  included  asphalt  paving,  widened  intersections,  viaduct  improvements  at Bloomingdale, and the extension of Kedzie Boulevard.  Social and Cultural Changes Following advances in transportation and infrastructure, the first two decades of the 20th century saw an explosion of growth in Logan Square. Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, Germans, Irish, English and Russians began to settle. When the community  population  peaked  at  more  than  100,000  people  in  the  1930s,  Poles  were  the  dominant  ethnicity  and remained so until the 1960s, when a significant Puerto Rican population moved in, along with immigrants from Cuba, Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries.    Expressway, Decline and Rejuvenation The community’s population began to wane in the 1950s as many city residents, reflecting national, post-war trends, moved to the suburbs. Other Logan Square residents were displaced by the construction of the Kennedy Expressway (I- 90/94).  Unlike  the  other  elements  of  transportation  infrastructure  that  precipitated  growth  spurts,  the  expressway, though beneficial for many local industries, disturbed the residential fabric of the community and contributed to pop- ulation losses. “For rent” signs multiplied in shop windows along Fullerton and Milwaukee, and many buildings began to deteriorate due to lack of investment and use.  Population Data Source: Census 2000  In 1963, the Logan Square Neighborhood Association was formed with the goal of improving existing housing and developing a cohesive community spirit. By the mid-1970s, signs of rejuvenation began to occur as high gasoline prices and the increasing cost of nearby, suburban housing helped stem the exodus. By the late 1980s, real estate investors were rehabilitating the community’s vintage housing stock, especially for new residents attracted to the area’s historic char- acter and transportation amenities. The trend continued into the 1990s. More recently, new homeowners took advan- tage of low interest rates and the area’s proximity to downtown to invest in the community. As of 2000, Logan Square’s population was growing again, albeit slightly, with a population of 82,715.   Today, the community is a vibrant mix of young and old residents and new and established businesses, all coexisting in a historic, urban environment that’s poised for the future. The Logan Square Open Space Plan aims to continue that trend by providing residents, workers and visitors with more open space.  4  L o g a n   S q u a r e   O p e n   S p a c e   P l a n  Previous Open Space Planning for Logan Square  Fig. 2 From A Greater West Park System  Fig. 3 From Life Along the Boulevards  Logan Square  Location  Other  than  the  boulevard  system,  few  plans  were  ever implemented  to  provide  for  Logan  Square’s  open  space needs.   In  1919,  landscape  architect  Jens  Jensen  published  A Greater  West  Park  System,  a  plan  (Fig.  2)  that  prescribed parkland along the Chicago River on the community’s east- ern  edge.  The  demand  for  industrial  space,  however, eclipsed  the  concept  and  the  area  evolved  instead  as  an industrial corridor.   The  1989  City  of  Chicago  plan  Life  Along  the  Boulevards (Fig.  3)  helped  increase  awareness  of  the  boulevards  as  a  system and highlighted Logan and Palmer squares as impor- tant  elements  of  that  system.    The  plan  detailed  historic landscape  treatments  used  along  Humboldt,  Kedzie  and Logan boulevards and proposed sympathetic updates to the landscape  plantings.    Authors  of  the  plan  noted  that  the boulevards  are  used  for  a  variety  of  recreational  uses,  but that  the  “mix  of  these  activities  is  often  far  from  ideal.” Recognizing  the  boulevards  as  a  valuable  recreational resource  for  the  city,  the  authors  recommended  that  the City  of  Chicago  and  the  Chicago  Park  District  “jointly explore the feasibility of transferring the boulevards back to the Park District.”  5  L o g a n   S q u a r e   O p e n   S p a c e   P l a n  In 1990, the Chicago Park District Land Policies Plan pinpointed 110 city blocks within Logan Square that were under- served by open space and highlighted the limited opportunities for park expansions.  The recommendations made for expanding Unity Park were pursued.  In addition, recommendations were made for improving existing parks and part- nering with schools to better use asphalt school grounds as a way to help compensate for the lack of space.    In 1993, the Chicago Park District acknowledged again the lack of new opportunities for park development but iden- tified a few small parcels that were available, as well as recommending an operating agreement with Logan Square’s Brentano Elementary School.  The parcels were too small for park sites and the one undeveloped small parcel owned by the Park District has become Neighbor’s Garden Park, a park maintained by nearby residents.  In  1998,  the  intergovernmental  CitySpace plan  assessed  the  public  open  space  inventories  of  every  Chicago  community and established a minimum acceptable standard of two acres of open space per 1,000 residents. Using 1990  census data, the plan’s analysis of Logan Square indicated .6 acres for every 1,000 residents. An updated analysis using 2000 census and parkland figures indicated slight improvement, but  Logan Square still needs 99 acres of public open space  to  meet  the  city’s  minimum  standards.  The  poor  ratio  escalated  the  City  of  Chicago’s  and  the  Chicago  Park District’s effort to find creative ways to address the shortage.  6  L o g a n   S q u a r e   O p e n   S p a c e   P l a n  Fig .5  Fig. 6  8  L o g a n   S q u a r e   O p e n   S p a c e   P l a n  Guiding Goals and Planning Process  Due to the resistance of public agencies and residents to acquiring and demolishing residential buildings to create more open space, the Logan Square Open Space Plan only considers existing vacant land for conversion to public open space. The primary goals of the plan are to:  1) Increase the amount of public open space with parks, plazas, gateways, greenways and other outdoor areas. 2) Improve the quality of existing open space and add more opportunities for active recreation. 3) Investigate recreational and open space opportunities along the unused Bloomingdale rail line. 4) Work with the community when buildings or tracts of land go on the market in areas not served by open space to  assess the feasibility of these sites for open space.  The planning process started in October 2002 and proceeded through the following phases: Step 1. Research and Outreach DPD  staff  gathered  census  data  and  analyzed  it  for  demographics,  density,  and  age  distribution  throughout  the  community (Fig. 7 & 8). Patterns of commercial and industrial development were studied and inventoried (Fig. 9), especially vacant property along Milwaukee, Fullerton, and Armitage avenues that could potentially be acquired by public agencies and converted to public use.

BACKGROUND   A Phase I report has been submitted to DOE for an  assessment.  Based on the conclusions of that report the  City may also require submission of a Phase II analysis.  The land will be sold as-is, with no warranties or  representations as to its environmental condition, and it will  be the responsibility of the applicant to complete any  remediation that may be required by the City or the Illinois  EPA.  The redevelopment agreement with the selected  respondent will include release and indemnification  language protecting the City from  liability.   The subject parcels were acquired by the City through  various processes including TRP, demo lien, judicial deed;  some parcels were acquired as early as 1979.   Brinshore-Michaels (BMT -1, LLC) was selected by CHA as  the Master Developer of the Robert  Taylor Homes in February 2001, and has been engaged to plan and implement the Taylor  redevelopment.  The Robert Taylor development received $35MM in HOPE VI funding from  HUD in 2001  to fund the redevelopment of the former Robert Taylor site.  The proposed  development is designed to complement and reinforce the first two offsite phases of  development, the II 0-unit Mahalia Place (Robert Taylor Phase C-1 ), which was completed in  2005, and the 118-unit Coleman Place (Robert Taylor Phase C-2), which was completed in 2009.  The proposed project is also designed to  complement the first two phases of on-site development,  the Hansberry Square (Robert Taylor Phase A-1) which was completed in 2007, and Savoy  Square (Robert Taylor Phase A-2) which was completed in 2010. Redeveloping mixed income  units both on and off site is the means by which the physical isolation of public housing residents  will be ended, and the stigma of an address west of State Street will be erased.  By building high  quality new construction rental housing on both sides of State Street, the old Robert Taylor site  will be merged seamlessly into the revitalizing Grand Boulevard community.   IV. PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT TEAM   Development Entity: The proposed project is being developed by a joint venture ofBrinshore  Development, LLC and The Michaels Development Company. In addition to all previous phases  of development at Legends South, Brinshore-Michaels has successfully undertaken the  redevelopment efforts at two other CHA public housing redevelopment sites- Henry Horner  Homes (now called Westhaven Park) and Ogden-North (now called Park Douglas). In all,  Brinshore-Michaels has completed the development of 1,234 mixed-income rental units in the  City of Chicago.   Negotiated Sale- Residentia13-I2   The new development will be owned by Legends C-3, LLC, a single-purpose entity. Legends C-3,  LLC is made up of a General Partner called Legends C-3  Manager, LLC that holds a .01% interest  and a Limited Partner that holds a 99.99% interest. The developer's organization chart is included in  the exhibits.   Consultants:  Landon  Bone  Baker  Architects  and  Johnson  &  Lee  are  the  architects  for  the  development  and  the  general  contractor  is  Powers  &  Sons  Construction.  Interstate  Realty  Management (IRM) will serve as the property manager for the development.   V. PROPOSED PROJECT   Project Overview:  The Legends South C-3  rental redevelopment consists of seventy-one (71)  new construction, mixed income rental units built on land currently owned by the City of  Chicago, which will be conveyed upon closing. These units are an important step toward  achieving the Chicago Housing Authority's historic Plan for Transformation.  The project will  provide 30 units of replacement public housing subject to Low Income Housing Tax Credit  (LIHTC) restrictions, as well as 23  affordable tax credit units also subject to LIHTC restrictions  and 18 unrestricted market rate units. The development is located in the 3rd Ward, which is  represented by Alderman Pat Dowell, and is a part of the 47th/King TIF district.   A site plan, floor plans and elevation are provided as  exhibits to this report.   Negotiated Sale· Residentia13-12   Unit Profile   Residential Unit Profile:  The following table provides a detailed description of the proposed  project.  The subject property will provide a total of71 rental units of which 53  units or 75% will  be affordable for households eaming no more than 60 percent of the area median income.  These  units will satisfY the Chicago affordable housing ordinance, which requires 10 percent of the total  units to be affordable in projects developed on land sold by the City or 20 percent in projects  receiving TIF assistance.

The Community Policing  Advisory Panel, consisting of national experts in the field, members of CPD Command Staff and Chicago  community leaders, was appointed to provide a comprehensive and thoughtful report proposing ways the  Department can engage and collaborate with communities to fight crime and restore trust.       “Chicago was the birthplace and, at one time, a national model for community policing and we need to build  upon this history to develop a community policing strategy for the 21st Century.  I am grateful to have such  a qualified group of individuals helping us develop these recommendations,” said Superintendent Johnson.   “To have an effective influence on reducing crime and building public trust, our strategy must give every  Chicagoan equal treatment and respect.”    The charge of this panel, chaired by CPD Chief of Patrol Fred Waller, will be to develop a series  of written recommendations outlining strategies for enhancing community policing by the end of the first  quarter of 2017.  The panel will be expected to take into account or include the following key components:      •  An acknowledgement that Community Policing is the Department’s core philosophy and not just a   •  Specific strategies to collaborate with communities to solve problems and address the conditions   •  A role for all city departments so the plan can leverage all resources available to communities,  •  Solutions for breaking down barriers between youth and the police, with input from Chicago youth,  •  Recommendations to align CPD resources with the new strategy in order to be successful,         •  A method to evaluate the plan and its impact on crime and on public perception of and trust in   program,   that lead to crime,   police.      “As a former Chicagoan who remains deeply invested in the future of the city, I am pleased to support  CPD’s efforts to renew its commitment to this foundational aspect of good policing,” said Yale Law School  Professor Tracey L. Meares, who served on President Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing.      312-745-6110  ·  3510 South Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 60653  ·  Fax 312-745-6999      The panel, sponsored by the Joyce Foundation and John D. and Catherine T.

Cyber Grants  contains the detailed questions that must be answered to define the proposed scope of work.   Cyber Grants also contains instructions about the organizational capabilities and legal  compliance required.    Program Authority and Purpose  Funding to support the issuance of this Request for Proposals (RFP) is from the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) and  Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Cooperative Agreements/PHEP Supplemental  for Ebola Preparedness and Response Activities: CDC RFA-TP12-12010302Supp15. This grant  covers a 12 month project period from March 1, 2016 – January 31, 2017.     The purpose of this RFP is to identify one agency that will conduct a community assessment of  targeted demographic groups within Chicago which include frequent global travelers, identifying  influential organizations and individuals within the targeted groups who can quickly reach,  mobilize and organize individuals in and traveling to/from Chicago. This information will be  used by CDPH to improve and strengthen its ability to reach and work with community members  and groups in the event of a potential infectious disease outbreak.    The agency must arrange and facilitate focus groups or other qualitative data collection methods  for each targeted population group. The agency must provide CDPH with a comprehensive  inventory of influential organizations in Chicago, including primary and secondary contact  information, preferred communication modes to most effectively reach and mobilize members  and recommendations for how CDPH can outreach, educate and mobilize these groups regarding  infectious disease threats. This information will be used by CDPH to establish and/or improve  relationships with the targeted population groups.    Background    On September 30, 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that  Thomas Eric Duncan had been diagnosed with the Ebola virus. Duncan, a 42-year old Liberian,  became the first person on American soil diagnosed with the disease that had reached outbreak  proportions in the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.    Duncan’s case, and subsequent death, resulted in intense media scrutiny and public attention  toward Ebola. The CDC and local public health agencies, including CDPH, escalated their  preparedness efforts regarding the Ebola virus. As part of their response, CDPH worked with  four Chicago hospitals to establish the Chicago Ebola Resource Network, the first group of  hospitals in the nation working together to prepare for a patient being diagnosed with Ebola. The  hospitals underwent audits and training with both CDPH and the CDC, and were among the first  35 hospitals in the nation, and the only network, to be designated Ebola treatment centers.     CDPH COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESPONSE Summary    Page 2      In addition to clinical preparations, CDPH launched a comprehensive community engagement  initiative including creating and disseminating fact sheets to West African community groups  and individuals, providing guidance to medical providers who serve Chicago’s West African  communities, hosting training sessions for providers and community leaders and actively  monitoring any travelers from impacted nations to Chicago who may have been at risk to  exposure.    Ebola highlighted the important role international travel has in the spread of infectious diseases.  It also highlighted the need for local health agencies across the nation to remain vigilant and to  invest appropriately in preparedness efforts to ensure they are better able to respond to potential  infectious disease outbreaks, including those that may originate abroad.     This is underscored by the fact that each day close to one million travelers arrive in the U.S.  Some of these travelers come from countries where infectious diseases persist and the countries  may not have the necessary public health infrastructure to identify or combat those diseases. As a  result, there is an ongoing risk that a traveler could introduce an infectious disease into the U.S;  once here, the disease could spread and result in illness, loss of life and large social and  economic consequences.     Chicago is a global hub and major entry point for global travelers. In 2014 alone, approximately  65,000 international flights carrying almost 11 million persons flew into Chicago’s O’Hare  Airport. As a result, there is a continued risk that a traveler could introduce an infectious disease  into Chicago and cause consequences similar to those cited above.      Ebola is one of many examples of a disease that has been introduced into the U.S. by  international travel. As one of only 5 airports in the U.S. that is now designated to receive  travelers from Ebola-affected countries, Chicago continues to be at-risk for having a traveler  introduce this disease here.    As Chicago is a global travel hub and a diverse city with residents who are connected to  communities across the world, our City’s preparedness efforts include establishing the most  effective  connections to community groups and organizations before an outbreak strikes,  building capacity among those communities to prepare and respond while also establishing  community contacts so CDPH and the communities can work together in the event of a future  outbreak that may impact one or more communities with global connections.    Available Funding:  A total of $80,000 is available through this RFP.  CDPH will grant one award up to $80,000.  Any contract awarded pursuant to this RFP shall begin on March 1, 2016 and run to January 31,  2017, with no extensions.

Democratic Organization of Cook  County, Case No 69 C 2145 (United States District Court for the Northern District of  Illinois). Among other things, the Shakman Accord and the City Hiring Plan prohibit  the City from hiring persons as governmental employees in non-exempt positions on the  basis of political reasons or factors.     (b) You are aware that City policy prohibits City employees from directing any  individual to apply for a position with you, either as an employee or as a subcontractor,  and from directing you to hire an individual as an employee or as a subcontractor.  Accordingly, you must follow your own hiring and contracting procedures, without  being influenced by City employees. All personnel provided by you under the grant  agreement are employees or subcontractors of you, not employees of the City of  Chicago. The grant agreement is not intended to and does not constitute, create, give  rise to, or otherwise recognize an employer-employee relationship of any kind between  the City and any personnel provided by you.                            8.       (c) You will not condition, base, or knowingly prejudice or affect any term or aspect of  the employment of any personnel provided under the grant agreement, or offer  employment to any individual to provide services under the grant agreement, based  upon or because of any political reason or factor, including, without limitation, any  individual's political affiliation, membership in a political organization or party,  political support or activity, political financial contributions, promises of such political  support, activity or financial contributions, or such individual's political sponsorship or  recommendation. For purposes of the grant agreement, a political organization or party  is an identifiable group or entity that has as its primary purpose the support of or  opposition to candidates for elected public office. Individual political activities are the  activities of individual persons in support of or in opposition to political organizations  or parties or candidates for elected public office.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 5,125 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Natchez Avenue (Grand- McLean), in N. Nagle Avenue (Grand-McLean), in W. McLean Avenue (Natchez-Narragansett),  and in W. Palmer Street (Natchez-Narragansett). The old pipe dates back to 1915, and needs to  be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Taliaferro’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Chris Taliaferro             29th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          Do you wonder what was happening in 1915?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:            BILLIE HOLIDAY   In Washington D.C., the first stone of the Lincoln Memorial was put into place.     The U.S. House of Representatives rejected a proposal granting women the right to vote.      Pluto was photographed for the first time, but not recognized as a planet.    John B. Gruelle was given a patent for his Raggedy Ann doll.    American jazz and blues singer Billie Holiday was born.    The first stop sign appeared in Detroit, Michigan.    Woodrow Wilson became the first President to attend a World Series game.                                              WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will install 5,125 feet of 8-inch water main in  N. Natchez Avenue (Grand-McLean), in N. Nagle Avenue (Grand-McLean), in W. McLean  Avenue (Natchez-Narragansett), and in W. Palmer Street (Natchez-Narragansett).    Reason:  The old main dates back to 1915 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We expect our work to start shortly, and be completed in December. Final restoration  will follow in the spring of 2016. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If  there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN CHRIS TALIAFERRO   773-237-6460      PETE SCALES   DEPARTMENT OF WATER MANAGEMENT   312-744-8822                        FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in December. Final  restoration will follow in the spring of 2016. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since  we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

(Keim)    Rule 2:  Any action or conduct which impedes the Department’s efforts to achieve its policy   and goals or brings discredit upon the Department. (Keim)     Rule 6:  Disobedience of an order or directive, whether written or oral. (Orsa, Boettcher,   and Keim)      Officers Orsa and Boettcher each requested Police Board review of his suspension on May   16, 2014, and Officer Keim requested Police Board review of his suspension on May 22, 2014.   Officers Boettcher and Keim each filed with the Police Board a memorandum delineating specific   reasons for which the review was requested (Officer Orsa did not do so).    Police Board Case Nos. 13 SR 2324, 2325, & 2328    Police Officers Orsa, Boettcher, & Keim           The Executive Director of the Police Board assigned these matters to Hearing Officer   Fredrick H. Bates.  Hearing Officer Bates reviewed the investigation file and submitted a written   report to the Police Board.     The members of the Police Board reviewed the Summary Report of the investigation file,   the recommendations of Command Channel Review, the officers’ memoranda, the Independent   Police Review Authority’s responses to the officers’ memoranda, and Hearing Officer Bates’s   report.  Hearing Officer Bates made an oral report to, and conferred with, the Police Board before   it rendered its findings and decision.       POLICE BOARD FINDINGS   The Police Board of the City of Chicago, as a result of its consideration of this matter, finds   and determines that:   1.   The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer William Orsa, Star No. 17885,   violated Rule 6 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the allegation   is therefore sustained.   On May 1, 2008, at approximately 0156 hours, at 654 West Garfield Boulevard, Chicago, in a  graveled parking lot, Officer Orsa did violate the provisions of General Order 93-03-02B,  Section II-B-1, in that he witnessed misconduct and failed to immediately notify a supervisor  and prepare a written report to memorialize the incident.        The allegations against the Officers Orsa, Boettcher, and Keim arise out of the same   nucleus of salient operative facts, which are as follows.      On May 1, 2008, at approximately 1:56 a.m., David Bradley and his brother, Trevor   Andrews, pulled into a vacant lot at 654 W. Garfield adjacent to the apartment building where   David Bradley lived, located at 652 W. Garfield. A police car drove into the alley and beamed a   spotlight into their white Towncar. The officers, subsequently identified as Officer Jerry Doskocz      2   Police Board Case Nos. 13 SR 2324, 2325, & 2328    Police Officers Orsa, Boettcher, & Keim    and Officer Joseph Keim, then approached the vehicle. Officer Keim asked Mr. Bradley his name,         and he provided his brother’s name, Trevor Andrews. When Officer Keim requested   identification, Mr. Bradley provided his correct name. Officer Keim placed Mr. Bradley in the rear   of the squad car and ran their names1, while Officer Doskocz stayed with the vehicle and Mr.   Andrews.      Two male uniformed Police Officers, subsequently identified as Officers William Orsa and   Jason Boettcher, arrived on scene in a squadrol. Officer Keim escorted Mr. Bradley back to the car   where Mr. Andrews and Officer Doskocz were near the rear of the white vehicle.    After his encounter with the officers, Bradley called 911 and complained of being made to   do push-ups in the mud and about being injured by the police. Sergeant Michael Kuber and another   Officer responded to the call. Bradley told them that the incident may have been recorded by the   Police Observation Device on 55th Street. Mr. Bradley’s mother, Juanita Andrews, took   photographs of Bradley that showed his injuries. An evidence technician also took photographs of   Mr. Bradley. He subsequently sought medical care at Stroger Hospital.   On May 2, 2008, Investigator Goodwin interviewed Trevor Andrews, who substantially   corroborated Mr. Bradley’s account of the encounter with the Chicago police officers on May 1,   2008.    A review of the Police Observation Device video shows two white officers conversing with   two black males in the gravel lot. At approximately 1:54 a.m. a squadrol is parked on the street just   west of the lot. Two police officers are seen walking towards the lot. An officer believed to be   Officer Keim is later observed searching the white vehicle on the driver’s side. Police Observation   Device photos depict the same thing as the video.                                                     1  On May 7, 2008, the Police Department’s Information Services Division confirmed that Officer Keim conducted a name search  from his vehicle at 1:56 a.m. for the names “David Bradley” and “Trevor Andrews.” Officers Keim and Doskocz consistently  indicated that Doskocz conducted the name search.      3   Police Board Case Nos. 13 SR 2324, 2325, & 2328    Police Officers Orsa, Boettcher, & Keim             The Independent Police Review Authority sustained the allegations against Officer   Doskocz that he instructed Bradley to do push-ups, and that he grabbed Bradley by his belt while   he was doing push-ups and pushed him back down, causing injury to Bradley. The Police   Observation Device photographs and video, combined with Officer Orsa’s April 7, 2010,   statement, clearly establish that Officers Orsa, Boettcher, and Keim were present when Mr.   Bradley was made to do push-ups in the rain, in a gravel lot, at 2:00 a.m. on May 1, 2008. The   notion that Mr. Bradley just suddenly dropped and started doing these push-ups of his own volition   is not credible. The two brothers’ mostly consistent stories are more likely than not more accurate   accounts of what took place during this incident. As stated above and in paragraph no. 4 below,   there is sufficient evidence to find that Officer Orsa witnessed misconduct by Officers Doskocz   and Keim and failed to immediately notify a supervisor and prepare a written report to   memorialize the incident in violation of the provisions of General Order 93-03-02B, Section   II-B-1, thereby violating Rule 6 as alleged.       2.      The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Jason Boettcher, Star No. 13670,   violated Rule 6 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the allegation   is therefore sustained.   On May 1, 2008, at approximately 0156 hours, at 654 West Garfield Boulevard, Chicago, in a  graveled parking lot, Officer Boettcher did violate the provisions of General Order 93-03-02B,  Section II-B-1, in that he witnessed misconduct and failed to immediately notify a supervisor  and prepare a written report to memorialize the incident.        See the findings set forth in paragraph nos. 1 and 4, which are incorporated here by   reference. Officer Boettcher witnessed misconduct by Officers Doskocz and Keim, and failed to   immediately notify a supervisor and prepare a written report to memorialize the incident in      4   Police Board Case Nos. 13 SR 2324, 2325, & 2328    Police Officers Orsa, Boettcher, & Keim    violation of the provisions of General Order 93-03-02B, Section II-B-1, thereby violating Rule 6         as alleged.      3.    The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Keim, Star No. 9822,   violated Rule 6 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the allegation   is therefore sustained.   On May 1, 2008, at approximately 0156 hours, at 654 West Garfield Boulevard, Chicago, in a  graveled parking lot, Officer Keim did violate the provisions of General Order 93-03-02B,  Section II-B-1, in that he witnessed misconduct and failed to immediately notify a supervisor  and prepare a written report to memorialize the incident.        See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 1 above, which are incorporated here by   reference. Officer Keim witnessed misconduct by Officer Doskocz and failed to immediately   notify a supervisor and prepare a written report to memorialize the incident in violation of the   provisions of General Order 93-03-02B, Section II-B-1, thereby violating Rule 6 as alleged.       4.    The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Keim, Star No. 9822,   violated Rule 1 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the allegation   is therefore sustained.   On May 1, 2008, at approximately 0156 hours, at 654 West Garfield Boulevard, Chicago, in a  graveled parking lot, Officer Keim did violate the provisions of Illinois Compiled Statutes,  Section 725 ILCS 5/108, effective 7-3-2003, item (1), in that he searched the interior of David  Bradley’s vehicle without justification.        See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 1 above, which are incorporated here by   reference. Officer Keim’s explanation proffered during his April 19, 2010, IPRA interview that he   conducted a “plain view search” of the vehicle for officer safety to make certain there were not any   weapons, and that he believed there was sufficient probable cause to search in “plain view” for a      5   Police Board Case Nos. 13 SR 2324, 2325, & 2328    Police Officers Orsa, Boettcher, & Keim    weapon, is belied by the Police Observation Device photographs which show him searching the         vehicle, not just looking to see what was in “plain view.” Moreover, Police Officer Boettcher’s   March 19, 2010, IPRA statement corroborates that the vehicle was searched. The evidence in this   case supports a finding that Officer Keim searched the interior of David Bradley’s vehicle without   justification in violation of Mr. Bradley’s constitutional rights, and thereby violated Rule 1 as   alleged.        5.      The allegation, set forth below, that Police Officer Joseph Keim, Star No. 9822,   violated Rule 2 is supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action, and the allegation   is therefore sustained.   On May 1, 2008, at approximately 0156 hours, at 654 West Garfield Boulevard, Chicago, in a  vacant graveled lot, Officer Keim by his overall actions or lack thereof, did bring discredit  upon the Department.        See the findings set forth in paragraph nos. 1, 3, and 4 above, which are incorporated here   by reference. Officer Keim’s conduct in this case clearly brought discredit upon the Department.   Therefore Officer Keim violated Rule 2 as alleged.       6.      The Police Board has considered the facts and circumstances of the officers’   conduct, and their complimentary and disciplinary histories.  Conducting an illegal search of a   vehicle and failing to report misconduct of a fellow officer are serious offenses. The suspensions   ordered by the Superintendent in this matter are not unwarranted.                   6   Police Board Case Nos. 13 SR 2324, 2325, & 2328    Police Officers Orsa, Boettcher, & Keim           POLICE BOARD DECISIONS      The Police Board of the City of Chicago hereby adopts the findings set forth herein by the   following votes:      By a vote of 7 in favor (Demetrius E. Carney, Ghian Foreman, William F. Conlon, Michael  Eaddy, Rita A. Fry, Elisa Rodriguez, and Rhoda D.

Fifteen parks offer public  open space, and residents are served  by the Lozano, Little Village, and Toman  libraries.  There are seven health ser- vice providers, including ACCESS, Alivio  Medical Center, Cook County, Esperan- za, Lawndale Christian, Mercy Hospital,  and Pilsen Homeless.  Leadership for  the area is provided by many commu- nity based organizations, who have  contributed to this and previous plans  for the Planning Area.  The Pilsen & Little Village Planning  area also includes relatively smaller  portions of the Near West Side and  Archer Heights community areas, but  the history and future investments  in these areas will be documented in  other action plans:  Near West Side in  the Near West Side Action Plan, and  Archer Heights in the Greater Midway  Action Plan.  PILSEN & LITTLE  VILLAGE HISTORY  AND COMMUNITY  ASSETS   The two neighborhoods of the Pilsen  & Little Village Planning Area both  developed as immigrant enclaves  offering rich employment opportunities  in industry. Pilsen was settled first,  with German and Irish immigrants  moving to the area in the 1840s.  After  the Chicago Fire of 1871, various  industries moved into the area.  These  created thousands of new, unskilled  jobs and in turn drew in new residents  attracted by the labor opportunities. It  was during this time that settlement in  Little Village began, spurred primarily  by the influx of German and Czech  immigrants. In the 1950s and 1960s,  Mexican immigrants began moving  into the communities in greater num- bers, a shift that was triggered by the  combination of loosening immigration  restrictions and the displacement of  Mexican residents from the Near West  Side during the expansion of the Uni- versity of Illinois at Chicago. By 1990,  over 83% of residents in both areas  were of Hispanic origin.  However, rapid  development and an influx of young  people during the following decade,   specifically in Pilsen, led to fears of  displacement and gentrification.  In  recent years, investments in affordable  housing by the City, in partnership with  community-based organizations, have  provided new housing options, while  allowing this young, creative communi- ty to flourish.  Today, the Pilsen & Little Village  Planning Area serves as the Mexi- can cultural and business center for  Chicago and the region.  Storefronts  sell Mexican food, wedding and  quinceañera gowns, music, clothing,  and other culturally-specific, hard-to- find goods, attracting a steady flow of  visitors.  Both Pilsen and Little Village  boast burgeoning art scenes that  include galleries, murals, music venues,  a Latino film festival, and diverse  programming for youth.  Pilsen’s more  established art scene has attracted the  young and hip, which in recent years  has led to the establishment of resale  shops, bars, and trendy restaurants.   An extensive network of churches and  community based organization provide  much needed social services through- out the Planning Area.  The Pilsen &Little Village neighbor- hoods are served by four CTA stations  along the Pink Line, and two METRA   13  3 CONTEXTFIRST DRAFT - FOR DISCUSSION16TH ST  Halsted St     E V A E N I C A R     T S D E T S L A H  Y P 90 X N E A Y N R A D  NORTH  Western Ave.  18th  CULLERTON ST  Western-Douglas  Damen  D A V E  N  B L U E ISL A     E V A N E M A D     E V A D N A L H S A     E V A N R E T S E W  T  T   S  S  1  3  California-Douglas CERMAK RD     I  E V A A N R O F I L A C  E V A E     I Z D E K  26TH ST  31ST ST  Y  P  X  N  E  55  al  n  a  hip C  d S  O  S  N  E  V  E  T  S     E V A R E N T S O K  D R    I  K S A L U P  hic a  C     E V A K R A P L A R T N E C     35TH PL n nit a r y a  a  o S  g  Chicago Neighborhoods Now: Pilsen & Little Village  ASSET MAP  Map Key  Interstates Metra Line & Station CTA Pink Line & Station Bike Lanes and Trails Parks and Open Space Water Industrial Corridor Public Schools Private Schools Colleges Libraries Hospitals Health Centers Police Stations Fire Houses  14  3 CONTEXTFIRTS DRAFT - FOR DISCUSSIONThe population of the Pilsen & Little  Village Planning Area has increased by  7% since 1970, compared with a  20%  drop for Chicago during the same period.  The area is 83% Hispanic or Latino, 10%  African-American and 7% White.  Nearly a  third of the households in Pilsen & Little  Village earn more than $50,000 per year,  which is lower than the city’s average.   The unemployment rate was higher here  than in the city overall in 2012 (the latest  year for which Planning Area level data  is available): 15.8% vs. 12.9% citywide.   Unemployment has dropped significantly  since then, and this data will be updated  in future iterations of this Action Plan.

This suggests that many Pilsen & Little  Village Planning Area residents leave  the area to shop. And they do: anecdotal  evidence suggests that residents often  travel to nearby suburbs where there are  big box retailers and shopping centers.  There may be a significant opportunity  to recapture some of that spending that  is leaking out of the Planning Area into  the surrounding areas, which will be the  subject of further study and discussion.     Vacancy rates in Pilsen & Little Village  have risen slightly for industrial/flex  space, but have fallen for both office and  retail space between 2005 and 2013.  The vacancy rate for the 3.62 million  square feet of retail buildings in the  Pilsen & Little Village Planning Area is  on par with the citywide average, and  fell during the period between 2006 and  2013, in spite of an increase in the total  retail space by over 100,000 SF.

Department of Business Affairs & Licensing  Local Liquor Control Commission   Scott V. Bruner, Director   )  )  )  )  )  )  ) )  )  )  )  Case No.  06 LA 15         ORDER   OPINION OF CHAIRMAN CALABRESE AND COMMISSIONER ADAMS   The licensee appeals a 15-day Suspension of his City licenses as a result of a finding that   he committed a battery of an insulting or provoking nature upon an employee.     The Local Liquor Control Commission after a hearing, found that the licensee forced   unwanted physical attention upon his employee.  As a result of the finding, they then suspended   all of his licenses for 15 days.  The majority believes that when the Local Liquor Control   Commission believes such conduct to have been committed they have the right to discipline the   license holder.  While the employee, clearly has additional remedies, the availability of such   remedies does not preclude the Local Liquor Control Commissioner from disciplining the   conduct of the licensee.  Here they have done just that.   We further believe that a 15-day Suspension of all his licenses is a very severe   1    punishment.  This is especially so in light of the 25 year unblemished record of the licensee.    While we might have found a lesser penalty, we do not have the power to modify a sanction   imposed within the authority of the Local Liquor Control Commission.  Such a modification is   better left for the consideration of the Circuit Court.  We affirm the finding of the Local Liquor   Control Commission.    OPINION OF COMMISSIONER KOPPEL IN DISSENT   This matter comes before the License Appeal Commission on a decision by the Mayor=s   License Commission to issue a 15-day suspension for advances made by the licensee to one of   his employees.  This is a restaurant with a liquor license.  The testimony indicated that the   complainant coming to work was greeted by a big sign saying AI Love You@.  In addition, the   owner repeatedly tried to kiss and hug her.  She ran out of the premises and went to her brother=s   house.  Later that night, she called the police and filed a report against the owner.  She waited a   week before she decided to charge him.  She indicated that she would drop any charges for   $20,000.  She waited nine hours to call the police.  There were inconsistencies in her testimony.    First, claiming that her breast was touched, but never disclosed that to the police.   The licensee has been in business for 25 years with no violations.  He was never cited or   charged by the police for battery or any other violation.   It seems to me that this does not come under a violation of a liquor violation.  Again, the   2    police did not charge him with battery.  The complainant was seeking to drop any charges for a   substantial payment.    This so called action does not seem to be any violation of the liquor law.  The alleged,   improper touching of an employee by the owner (who was not charged by the police) seems to   me to be a civil matter.    To close the place for 15 days predicated upon a non-liquor license violation and on   someone who has been in business for 25 years seems improper.  This is a civil matter and   predicated on all these facts.  The case should be reversed.   Irving J. Koppel  Commissioner    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED That the order Suspending the   liquor   3    license of the appellant for FIFTEEN (15) days is AFFIRMED.   Pursuant to section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a Petition for Rehearing may be filed  with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the  mailing of this order is deemed to be the date of service.

City  Of Chicago   Stockyards  Industrial/Commercial  Redevelopment  Area   Tax  Increment  Finance  Program   Redevelopment  Plan   December,  1988.   I.   Introduction.   One  of  the  most  historically  significant  of  Chicago's  many  diverse  neighborhoods is the Back of the Yards, located on the City's southwest side.  This area  was  world  renowned  as  the  center of the  nation's meat packing  industry in the early part of the 20th century.  In order to accommodate the  meat packing industry numerous train lines served the Stockyards packing  area primarily in the square mile between 39th Street and 47th Street from  Halsted Street to  Ashland Avenue  (known  as the Union Stockyards).  The  ·•·area,  once  a  port of entry for  immigrants,  offered  a  wide  variety of retail   3/19/97   REPORTS  OF  COMMITTEES   41141   services and employment opportunities.  With the closing of the Stockyards  due to the movement of the meat packing industry to more western states in  the second half of the 20th century, the area gradually declined as economic  . and consumer patterns changed.  The buildings left by the packers became  functionally and economically obsolete and most began to deteriorate.   At  the  same  time,  the  advent  of  regional  and  strip  shopping  centers  changed  consumer  shopping  patterns  and  brought  decline  to  the  two  (2)  primary shopping streets, 47th Street and Ashland Avenue.   While  there  has  been  a  general decline  in  the  economic  strength  of the  Back  of the  Yards  area,  it  possesses  several  strong  elements  which  have  helped to maintain a level of economic vitality through the years of decline,  and provide a base for revitalization.   Chief among these is the  redevelopment of the Stockyards meat packing  center as a  major modern  industrial park.  The industrial  park, developed  with assistance of the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council, the City of  Chicago  and  the  United  States  Department  of  Commerce  -- Economic  Development Administration, the United States Department of Housing and  Urban  Development and  various other  federal  agencies,  has  created  over  one  hundred (100)  new  businesses employing  in  excess  of seven  thousand  (7 ,000)  persons.  The  industrial park is now  nearly filled,  the  only  nearby  vacant  area  which  can  be  developed  lacks  cleared  land,  roadways  and  utilities.   However, the Back of the Yards area does  have extensive vacant, under(cid:173)  utilized and blighted areas available for  development for  both commercial  and industrial use.  This land has not been developed in the past because of:  (1)  soil  problems;  (2)  environmental  issues;  (3)  toxic  wastes;  (4)  building  abandonment;  (5)  lack  of public  infrastructure;  and  (6)  deterioration  and  blight of existing structures.   To  assist in  the  development  of new  industrial  and  commercial  centers  within  the Back of the  Yards area,  various agencies have joined  together.  The lead organization in this strategy is the Back of the Yards Neighborhood  Council  (B.Y.N.C.),  a  not-for-profit  group  composed  of all  sectors  of the  community, which has worked along with the City of Chicago Department of  Economic Development, the Economic Development Commission of Chicago,  and neighborhood  businesses and residents,  in developing  a  framework  to  guide and direct the revitalization of the Stockyards Industrial/Commercial  Redevelopment Area.  In  developing the  framework,  a  consensus  building  approach  was  adopted  by  the  Back  of  the  Yards  Neighborhood  Council.  While  there  has  been  development  in  the  Back  of the  Yards  area  by  the  private sector, much of the remaining land which can be  put to  productive  use  need  substantial  investment of public  funds  in  order  to  achieve  such  productive development.   41172   JOURNAL--CITY  COUNCIL--CHICAGO   3/19/97   Recommending  To  The  City  Council  Of   The  City  Of Chicago   For  The   Stockyards  Industrial/Commercial   Tax  Increment  Financing   Redevelopment Project  Area:   Approval  Of   Amendment Number  2   To  The   Redevelopment  Plan.
