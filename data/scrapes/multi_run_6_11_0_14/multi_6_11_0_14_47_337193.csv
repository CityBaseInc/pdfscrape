This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you,  our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     The Department of Water Management will soon install a new sewer in N. Avers Avenue, from  W. Lawrence Avenue to W. Ainslie Avenue, and in W. Ainslie Avenue, from N. Springfield  Avenue to N. Ridgeway Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1913, and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Laurino’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Margaret Laurino       39th Ward        1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           Do you wonder what was happening in 1913? That’s the year the old sewer main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:          ROSA PARKS                 Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States.    Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in Sheffield, England.    The Ford Motor company introduced the first moving assembly line.    The first prize was inserted into a Cracker Jack box.    Gideon Sundback patented the zipper.    The Panama Canal opened.    Civil rights activist Rosa Parks was born in Tuskegee, Alabama.                                   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing a new sewer in N. Avers  Avenue, from W. Lawrence Avenue to W. Ainslie Avenue, and in W. Ainslie Avenue, from N.  Springfield Avenue to N. Ridgeway Avenue.     Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1913 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by Argyle  on the north, Lawrence on the south, Ridgeway on the east, and Springfield on the west will  benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work begins shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in February 2013. Full  restoration of the damaged streets/parkways will follow. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic and Parking:  We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work  hours (7am-4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that  cars be moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we  can, but since sewers run down the middle of the street, we may have closures to “through  traffic”. You will always have access to your home or business. Safety is always our first  consideration.    During construction in Lawrence Avenue, in the interest of public safety, Lawrence will be  closed to “through traffic” between Springfield and Hamlin. Westbound traffic will be detoured  along Pulaski, Foster, and Kedzie. Eastbound traffic will be detoured along Pulaski, Montrose,  and Kedzie. “Local Traffic Only” will be allowed between Pulaski and Springfield and Kedzie  and Hamlin.           CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN MARGARET LAURINO   773- 736-5594      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Laurino, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

By	late	November	2016,	Department	of	Water	Management	(DWM)	and	Benchmark	Construction	 Company	crews	will	begin	the	work	to	install	420	feet	of	new	8‐inch	and	1,598	feet	of	new	16‐inch	 water	main	in	S.	Buffalo	Avenue,	from	E.	90th	Street	to	E.	92nd	Street,	E.	91st	Street,	from	S.	Buffalo	 Avenue	to	S.	Mackinaw	Avenue,	E.	92nd	Street,	from	S.	Buffalo	Avenue	to	145	feet	east	of	S.	Buffalo	 Avenue	and	S.	Green	Bay	Avenue,	from	E.	91st	Street	to	80	feet	south	of	E.	91st	Street.	The	old	water	 main	dates	back	to	1890,	and	needs	to	be	replaced.		 	If	you	would	like	to	receive	regular	email	updates	about	the	progress	of	the	project,	please	go	to	 BuildingANewChicago.org	to	register	for	the	WaterALERT	program.		Simply	enter	your	name,	 email	address	and	the	project	identification	number	at	the	top	of	this	letter.	 	By	signing	up	for	the	WaterALERT	emails,	you	will	be	notified	as	the	project	enters	each	new	 construction	phase	–	from	our	mobilization	of	equipment	onto	the	site,	to	the	installation	of	new	 pipes,	to	the	final	restoration	of	the	street.	 	When	we	are	working	in	the	street,	we	may	close	or	limit	it	to	traffic	for	safety	reasons,	but	you	will	 always	be	able	to	reach	your	home	or	business.		Outside	of	working	hours,	a	travel	lane	will	be	left	 open	for	local	traffic	only.		 	We	will	post	our	work	area	for	“No	Parking”	as	needed	during	work	hours	(generally	7am‐4pm).		 Parking	outside	of	those	hours	will	be	allowed,	but	cars	will	need	to	be	moved	by	the	start	of	the	 next	workday.		We	will	try	to	preserve	as	much	parking	space	as	possible.	 	We	know	that	construction	always	involves	inconveniences	and	noise.	We	will	do	everything	 possible	to	maintain	your	quality	of	life	throughout	these	projects,	and	conducting	ourselves	as	 good	and	thoughtful	neighbors	in	the	course	of	our	presence	on	your	street.		 	Should	you	have	any	questions	or	concerns,	you	can	either	ask	the	construction	foreman	during	the	 project,	or	call	any	of	the	following	numbers:	 	   24‐Hour	City	Service	and	Information	Line:		311	   10th	Ward	Office:	773‐768‐8138	   DWM	Office	of	Public	Affairs:		312‐744‐6635	     Genwmnot03032016   	 Flushing	after	Your	Service	Line	has	been	Connected	to	the	New	Water	Main		  	When	we	switch	over	the	services	from	the	old	main	to	the	new	water	main,	we	will	interrupt	water	 service.		We	give	you	24‐hour	notice	when	this	is	to	happen.		However,	in	the	event	of	an	emergency	 shutdown	during	construction,	we	may	not	be	able	to	give	you	prior	warning.	 	Now	that	your	old	water	main	has	been	replaced	and	your	water	service	has	been	connected	to	the	 new	water	main,	it	is	important	to	flush	your	plumbing	of	any	sediment,	rust	or	metals,	including	 any	lead	to	maintain	water	quality.			 	Sediment,	rust	and	metals,	including	any	lead	may	collect	in	the	aerator	screen	located	at	the	tip	of	 your	faucets.		These	screens	should	be	removed	prior	to	flushing.	 (1)	Please	find	the	closest	available	tap	(an	outside	 hose	spigot,	laundry	sink	faucet	or	bathtub)	to	where	 the	water	comes	into	the	home	that	is	not	used	for	 drinking	water.	Fully	open	the	cold	water	tap	and	let	 the	water	run	for	at	least	5	minutes.		Next	flush	any	 other	cold	water	faucets	on	that	floor	for	at	least	5	 minutes.		 (2)Move	to	the	next	highest	floor	and	repeat.	 (3)	Move	to	additional	floors	in	sequence	and	flush									 any	taps	or	faucets	for	at	least	5	minutes.		 			If	you	have	any	questions	or	concerns	about	your	water	quality,	or	if	you	would	like	your	water	 tested,	please	call	us	at	311.		For	additional	advice	and	information	visit	 http://www.epa.gov/il/advice‐chicago‐residents‐about‐lead‐drinking‐water.	 	 If	your	water	line	has	been	idle	or	stagnant	for	more	than	6‐hours,	it	is	advised	that	you	flush	for	at	 least	5	minutes	to	maintain	water	quality.		This	may	include	flushing	the	toilet,	taking	a	shower	and	 doing	laundry.			 	 Lastly,	if	you	don’t	already	have	one,	I	ask	you	to	consider	the	installation	of	a	water	meter	in	your	 home	to	help	you	save	money	on	your	water	bill.			For	more	information	on	this	free	program,	go	to	 www.metersave.org.	 	Thank	you	in	advance	for	your	patience	and	cooperation	during	this	important	infrastructure	 improvement	project.

Sedgwick, Suite 400, Chicago, IL 60654      Phone 312/744-4111, Fax 312/744-1081, TTY 312/744-1088   www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations              REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION IN EMPLOYMENT         A  reasonable  accommodation  is  an  adjustment  of  a  job  or  work  environment  which  allows  an  employee with a disability to perform essential job functions.  Under the Chicago Human Rights  Ordinance,  employers  must  provide  reasonable  accommodations  to  employees  with  known  disabilities  unless  the  accommodation  imposes  an  undue  hardship  on  the  operation  of  the  business.    Employees must request a reasonable accommodation, unless the need for it is obvious.  There is  no  requirement  to  use  the  exact  term  “reasonable  accommodation”  when  making  the  request.   Accommodation  requests  may  be  made  orally,  although  employers  may  establish  reasonable  procedures including documentation of a request.      Examples of reasonable accommodations include:   -  Modifying work schedules  -  Physical alterations of the work site  -  Providing special equipment, devices or software  -  Providing additional leave  -   Job restructuring      Reasonable accommodations do not include:    -  Providing an accommodation of a personal nature such as, a driver or hearing aids  -  Creating a new position for an employee    -  Hiring two employees to perform one job  -  Bumping an incumbent employee from a position      Employees  are  not  entitled  to  the  exact  accommodation  they  request,  only  an  accommodation  that  is  reasonable.    Once  requested,  employees  and  employers  must  engage  in  an  interactive  process to identify a reasonable accommodation.  What constitutes a reasonable accommodation  must be decided on a case-by-case basis.    Penalties for violations of the Ordinance include—   -     Fines of $100 to $1,000 per incident, paid to the City.  -     Damages and attorney fees, paid to the complaining party.  -     An injunction ordering specific actions to eliminate discriminatory practices.    A  person  who  claims  to  have  been  subjected  to  discrimination  may  file  a  complaint  at  the  Commission  on  Human  Relations.    The  Commission  investigates  and  rules  on  each  discrimination  complaint  through  a  neutral  process  which  gives  complainants  and  respondents  the opportunity to present evidence and legal arguments to support their positions.      See  the  back  of  this  flyer  for  selected  ordinance  and  regulation  provisions.    For  more  information, see www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations.        SELECTED LEGAL PROVISIONS   Disability Discrimination – Reasonable Accommodation     Reg. 365.130     Reasonable Accommodation   (a)   Reasonable Accommodation Requirement                                 Employers must reasonably accommodate the known physical or mental disabilities of a qualified individual who is an  applicant or employee unless such employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship  on the operation of the business entity.  Unless the employer knows that the qualified individual or applicant has a dis- ability requiring accommodation (because it is apparent, for example), the individual or applicant must initiate a request  to the employer for accommodation.   (b)    Definition of Reasonable Accommodation   ""Reasonable Accommodation,"" for purposes of Part 300, means a modification which allows a qualified individual to  fulfill  the  essential  functions  of  the  job.    Examples  of  reasonable  accommodation  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:   alteration  of  the  facility  or  work  site;  job  restructuring;  part-time  or  modified  work  schedules;  allowing  additional  unpaid  leave  to  enable  the  employee  to  obtain  necessary  medical  treatment;  acquisition  or  modification  of  furniture,  equipment or devices; appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies; and the  provision of qualified readers or interpreters.   (c)    Exceptions    Among other things, an employer may not be required to:   (1) make accommodations of a personal nature, e.g., provide eye-glasses or hearing aids;   (2) hire two full-time employees to perform one job in order to accommodate a person with a disability;   (3)  provide an employee with a disability additional paid leave;   (4)  ""bump""  an  incumbent  employee  from  a  position  to  create  a  vacancy  in  order  to  accommodate  a  person  with a disability; and   (5)  make  any  accommodations  which  would  violate  the  provisions  of  an  existing  collective  bargaining  agreement.     Reg. 365.140     Undue Hardship                        For the purposes of Part 300, ""undue hardship"" will be proven if the financial costs or administrative changes that are  demonstrably  attributable  to  the  accommodation  of  the  needs  of  persons  with  disabilities  would  be  prohibitively  expensive or would unduly affect the ordinary course of the business.   (a)  There  must  be  objective  evidence  of  financial  costs,  administrative  changes,  or  projected  costs  or  changes  which  would result from accommodating the needs of persons with disabilities;   (b) Factors to be considered in determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship, include, but  are not limited to:   (1) the overall size of the employer (as measured by number of employees, facilities or budget);   (2) the nature and cost of the accommodation;   (3) the overall financial resources of the employer, including the resources of any parent organization;   (4) the effect on expenses and resources, or other impact of such accommodation upon the operation of the  employer; and   (5) the potential benefits, including facilitating access by other employees, applicants, clients and customers  with disabilities.      "

By	late	December	2018,	Department	of	Water	Management	(DWM)	and	NPL	Construction	Company	 crews	will	begin	the	work	to	install	2,652	feet	of	new	8‐inch	water	main	in	N.	Central	Park	Avenue,	 from	W.	Belmont	Avenue	to	W.	Diversey	Avenue. The	old	water	main	dates	back	to	1891,	and	needs	 to	be	replaced.	We	expect	the	water	main	work	to	be	completed	by	mid	March	2018. Restoration	 will	follow	in	mid	April	2018.	Dates	may	change	depending	on	weather	and	other	factors.			 	If	you	would	like	to	receive	regular	email	updates	about	the	progress	of	the	project,	please	go	to	 BuildingANewChicago.org	to	register	for	the	WaterALERT	program.		Simply	enter	your	name,	 email	address	and	the	project	identification	number	at	the	top	of	this	letter.	 	By	signing	up	for	the	WaterALERT	emails,	you	will	be	notified	as	the	project	enters	each	new	 construction	phase	–	from	our	mobilization	of	equipment	onto	the	site,	to	the	installation	of	new	 pipes,	to	the	final	restoration	of	the	street.	 	When	we	are	working	in	the	street,	we	may	close	or	limit	it	to	traffic	for	safety	reasons,	but	you	will	 always	be	able	to	reach	your	home	or	business.		Outside	of	working	hours,	a	travel	lane	will	be	left	 open	for	local	traffic	only.		 	We	will	post	our	work	area	for	“No	Parking”	as	needed	during	work	hours	(generally	7am‐4pm).		 Parking	outside	of	those	hours	will	be	allowed,	but	cars	will	need	to	be	moved	by	the	start	of	the	 next	workday.		We	will	try	to	preserve	as	much	parking	space	as	possible.	 	We	know	that	construction	always	involves	inconveniences	and	noise.	We	will	do	everything	 possible	to	maintain	your	quality	of	life	throughout	these	projects,	and	conducting	ourselves	as	 good	and	thoughtful	neighbors	in	the	course	of	our	presence	on	your	street.

Breastfeeding provides a protective effect against  respiratory illnesses, ear infections, gastrointestinal  diseases and allergies including asthma, eczema  and atopic dermatitis.1-3   Infants who are not  breastfed are 36% more likely to die of Sudden In- fant Death Syndrome (SIDS), 22% more likely to be  overweight or obese as children, and at increased  risk for developing leukemia, diabetes, and asthma.  Mothers that choose not to breastfeed are also at  increased risk for developing ovarian cancer, breast  cancer, diabetes and metabolic syndrome.     Even with all of these known risks, many mothers  do not breastfeed their infants. In Illinois, 70.6% of  mothers begin breastfeeding their infants after birth,  but only 35% continue to exclusively breastfeed at  three months.4 These rates fall well below the  Healthy People 2020 goals for breastfeeding initia- tion (81.9%) and exclusivity through three months  (46.2%). Implementation of the Baby-Friendly Hos- pital Initiative (BFHI) in all Chicago hospitals will  help Illinois and Chicago mothers reach these  goals.    The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative    The BFHI was created in 1991 by the World Health  Organization and UNICEF to foster maternity care  practices that promote and support breastfeeding.  Today, over 20,000 maternity and infant care facili- ties in 156 countries are designated as Baby- Friendly Hospitals.     In the United States, momentum for the BFHI is  growing. In fact, over 400 hospitals in the United  States are currently in the process of applying for  Baby-Friendly designation, and many more are   The Baby-Friendly Steps for the United States:  1. Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely    communicated to all health care staff.   2. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to   implement this policy.   3. Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and   management of breastfeeding.   4. Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within an hour of    birth.   5. Show mothers how to breastfeed and maintain lac-  tation, even if separated from their infant.   6. Give newborn infants no food or drink other than   breast milk, unless medically indicated.   7. Practice rooming in – allowing mothers and infants   to remain together 24 hours a day.   8. Encourage breastfeeding on demand (encourage   feeding on cue).   9. Give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding   infants.   10.Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support    groups and refer mothers on discharge.   working to improve their breastfeeding practices.  However, there are currently only two Baby- Friendly hospitals in Illinois, and none in Chicago.    There is overwhelming evidence to support the  positive impact that achieving Baby-Friendly hospi- tal designation has on mothers, babies, and hospi- tals.5,6 Hospitals that implement the Ten Steps for  Successful Breastfeeding, or even just a few of the   steps, demonstrate dramatic increases in breast- feeding rates of initiation, exclusivity, and duration.  For example, at Boston Medical Center, breast- feeding initiation rates rose from 58% to 87% dur- ing Baby-Friendly implementation in 1999.7 Still,    Page 2                 Breastfeeding and the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative   Marc h 2012   many hospitals receive lucrative incentives from  formula companies, a hurdle that impedes BFHI  participation. In addition, launching a BFHI takes a  commitment from hospital leadership as well as all  staff who support the maternity unit, as the devel- opment of hospital policy and the execution of  BFHI training takes significant time and resources.    In spite of this, BFHI implementation provides a  high return on investment for hospitals. Hospitals  benefit from quality improvement, cost contain- ment, public relations, and prestige. For example,  increased breastfeeding rates can impact hospital  costs related to a reduction in postpartum compli- cations and pediatric readmissions.8 Furthermore,  providing this optimal level of mother-baby care  allows hospitals to market themselves as leaders in  maternity care. Meeting the needs of families by  implementing evidence-based practices to support  breastfeeding can improve patient satisfaction and  impact hospital choice made by patients.     In order to achieve official Baby-Friendly hospital  designation, facilities must meet the requirements  for the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (the  “Baby-Friendly Steps”) as outlined by WHO/ UNICEF.9 The Steps are evidence-based practices  and outline policies and procedures that maternity  facilities must adopt to promote and support breast- feeding.   Chicago Hospitals that are Registered    with Baby-Friendly USA:        Holy Cross Hospital      Mount Sinai Hospital      Norwegian American Hospital      Prentice Women’s Hospital/  Northwestern Memorial Hospital        Resurrection Medical Center      Roseland Community Hospital      Saint Anthony Hospital      Saint Joseph Hospital      University of Illinois Hospital   The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative in Chicago    Healthy Places is a city-wide obesity prevention  project funded by the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) that is implemented by the  Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and  the Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Chil- dren (CLOCC).  As part of this initiative, Healthy  Places is working with HealthConnect One and the  Illinois Chapter of the American Academy of Pedi- atrics to assist Chicago maternity hospitals in im- proving their support and promotion of breastfeed- ing through implementation of the BFHI.    Healthy Places has connected with all 19 materni- ty centers in Chicago and is working with them to  form multi-disciplinary breastfeeding committees,  garner support for implementing breastfeeding  quality improvement projects, revise infant feeding  policies, and provide education to staff and physi- cians about  breastfeeding. This strategic outreach  and implementation plan has resulted in nine  (47%) Chicago hospitals registering with Baby- Friendly USA to take steps to become officially  designated as Baby-Friendly hospitals. Additional- ly, other hospitals have secured letters of support  from upper-level administration for implementation  of breastfeeding supportive practice changes or  have convened multi-disciplinary breastfeeding  committees to plan and implement breastfeeding  practice changes. Many hospitals are revising their  breastfeeding policies and developing staff training  programs about breastfeeding to incrementally  implement Baby-Friendly Steps, such as initiating  skin to skin contact immediately following delivery.  In addition to individual hospital progress, many  perinatal centers and health systems are requiring  each hospital in their network to implement breast- feeding quality improvement projects in 2012 and  2013, including the University of Chicago Perinatal  Network, the Rush Perinatal Network, and the Ad- vocate Health Care Hospital System.    Healthy Places is also working to increase breast- feeding awareness, education, and services at the  community level. ACCESS Community Health  Network in Rogers Park, Heartland Human Care  Services in Englewood and the Southwest Organ- izing Project (SWOP) in Chicago Lawn are      Page 3                 Breastfeeding and the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative   March 2012   funded to educate families about the importance of  breastfeeding, inform businesses and worksites  about Illinois lactation laws, and implement worksite  lactation programs.  They are also promoting aware- ness of the BFHI among community members and  working with local hospitals to establish or connect  local breast-feeding support resources to community  members.    Legislative Support for Breastfeeding Mothers      A  leading  reason  women  stop  breastfeeding  earlier  than   recommended  is  because  their  workplaces  don’t  provide  the  break  time  or  the  private  space  needed  to  express  milk.    Employer  barriers  to  accommodating  these  needs  include  lost  productivity  due  to  breaks  as  well  as  con- struction  costs  associated  with  creating  private  breast- feeding rooms. However, evidence shows that supporting  breastfeeding  mothers  at  the  workplace  results  in  lower  health  care  costs,  employees  taking  less  sick  time,  and  the ability to retain experienced women as employees.    To  encourage  employers  to  support  breastfeeding  em- ployees,  the  Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA)  includes  provi- sions requiring employers to provide nursing mothers with  break  time  and  a  place,  other  than  a  bathroom,  that  is  shielded from view and free from intrusion to express milk  at  work  up  until  a  child’s  first  birthday.    The  Wage  and  Hour  Division  at  the  U.S.  Department  of  Labor  (DOL)  is  responsible for implementing this new requirement, which  took  effect  in  2011.    Although  this  provision  applies  only  to  the  hourly  workers  covered  by  Section  7  of  the  Fair  Labor Standards Act, the DOL is encouraging employers  to  fulfill  these  requirements  for  salaried  staff.    Under  the  ACA,  the  President  also  delegated  authority  for  these  same  provisions  to  be  provided  to  the  federal  civilian  workforce.    Also  at  the  federal  level,  the  Child  Nutrition  Act  (2010)  strengthens  the  role  of  the  Special  Supple- mental  Nutrition  Program  for  Women,  Infants  and  Chil- dren  (WIC),  which  provides  mothers  with  breastfeeding  resources, support, and supplies.   At  the  state  level,  two  efforts  seek  to  expand  the  BFHI.  Representative  Robyn  Gabel  introduced  the  Hospital  In- fant Feeding Act (HB 4968), a bill requiring every hospital   with  birthing  services  to  adopt  an  infant  feeding  policy  that promotes breastfeeding, and for this policy to be rou- tinely communicated to staff in the hospital's obstetric and  neonatal  areas.    This  bill  is  expected  to  pass  the  House  and proceed to the Senate for consideration.  In addition,  Illinois  Department  of  Public  Health  (IDPH)  will  be  work- ing  to  promote  the  BFHI  statewide  through  their  CDC  Community Transformation Grant.     Chicago Department of Public Health Initiatives    CDPH is moving forward with implementing its  own breastfeeding promotion policies.  These poli- cies include:  (1) encouraging the passage of a  City ordinance that prohibits discrimination against  breastfeeding in public places, and (2) working  with insurance agencies to implement policy  changes to support preconception/ interconcep- tional care, education and breastfeeding practices  for mothers.  To supplement these local policy ini- tiatives, CDPH is also actively supporting the Na- tional Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition  communication tool, Text4baby.  Text4baby sup- ports mothers by providing positive health mes- sages and tips via text, including breastfeeding  support. CDPH will continue to monitor and sup- port implementation of the BFHI in Chicago.   ***********************************             References  1American Academy of Pediatrics, Section on Breastfeeding.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                Prizes were included in Cracker Jack boxes for the first time.    The RMS Titanic made its first and last voyage.    Fenway Park in Boston opened.    Chicago Sun-Times columnist Irv Kupcinet, painter Jackson Pollock, and American chef   Julia Child were born.     LifeSavers candy made its debut.    Mail was carried by airplane for the first time.    A chemist named Kazimierz Funk coined the term “vitamins”.                                     CAMPBELL AVE. AND 47TH PL. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,154 feet of 8-inch  water main S. Campbell Avenue, from W. 47th Street to W. 48th Street, and W. 47th Place, from  S. Campbell Avenue to S. Western Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1912 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by early October 2013. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow S. Campbell Avenue and W. 47th Place outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE                       ALDERMAN GEORGE A. CARDENAS   3-1-1   773- 523-8250   312-742-1021   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in early October  2013. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.   Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets.  These  screens should be removed prior to flushing.  This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement.  If you have any  questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.           DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.    Want to learn more?  http://www.cityofchicago.org/watermanagement/bfp             DEPA RTM EN T OF WATER MANAGEM EN T            C ITY  OF CHICAGO    What is MeterSave?    MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!

Cigarette Tax Ruling #2  Subject:  Tax Stamps  Effective date:  November 1, 2004    In order to implement security features designed to reduce stamp fraud and in response to  the April 1, 2004 Cook County tax increase, the City of Chicago, Department of  Revenue, pursuant to Section 3-42-040 (A) of the Chicago Municipal Code, changed the  version of its combined tax stamp offered for sale, effective June 1, 2004.    Cigarette packages displaying the discontinued stamp may continue to be displayed for  sale until May 31, 2005. Thereafter, it shall be unlawful to display for sale any cigarette  products with the discontinued stamp. Any improperly stamped cigarettes displayed for  sale after May 31, 2005 shall be subject to seizure, as per Municipal Code Section 3-42- 110.    Any old stamps affixed to cigarette packages in your possession after May 31, 2005, may  be submitted to the Chicago Department of Revenue, Tax Refund Unit, 333 S. State  Street, Chicago, Il 60604-3977, for redemption of taxes previously paid during the month  of June 2005. Only those stamps properly affixed to packages of cigarettes will be  accepted.

This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
