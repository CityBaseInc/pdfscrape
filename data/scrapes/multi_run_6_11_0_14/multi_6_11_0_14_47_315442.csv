Climate change threatens human health, including    mental health, and access to clean air, safe drinking  water, nutritious food, and shelter. Everyone is affected  by climate change at some point in their lives. Some  people are more affected by climate change than  others because of factors like where they live; their age,  health, income, and occupation; and how they go  about their day-to-day life.   Older adults are vulnerable to climate change-related    health impacts for a number of reasons. One reason is  that normal changes in the body associated with aging,  such as muscle and bone loss, can limit mobility. Older  adults are also more likely to have a chronic health  condition, such as diabetes, that requires medications  for treatment. Some older adults, especially those with  disabilities, may also need assistance with daily  activities. In 2010, nearly half of people over age 65  were reported to have a disability, compared to about  17% of people aged 21–64. This includes disabilities in  one or more areas related to communication (seeing,  hearing, or speaking), mental functioning (such as    Alzheimer’s disease, senility, or dementia), and physical  functioning (limited or no ability to walk, climb stairs,  or lift or grasp objects).   As the nation’s population aged 65 and over is set to  nearly double by the year 2050—from approximately  48 million to 88 million—the number of people living  with the vulnerabilities mentioned above will grow. For  example, the percentage of older adults with diabetes   increased from    9% in 1980 to  nearly 20% in 2009. Similarly,  about 5 million Americans over 65  had Alzheimer's disease in 2013. This  number is expected to almost triple  by 2050.   It is important for older adults, their families, and  caregivers to understand the impact of climate change    on their health so they can begin planning to protect  themselves from exposure.   What is climate change and why does it  matter for health?   We’ve all heard of it, but what exactly is climate change?  Greenhouse gases act like a blanket around Earth,  trapping energy in the atmosphere. Human activities,  especially burning fossil fuels for energy, increase the  amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and  cause the climate to warm. Climate is the typical or  average weather for an area. Climate change is any  change in average weather that lasts for a long period of  time, like warming temperatures. Climate change affects  the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we  drink. It also leads to extreme weather events, like  flooding, droughts, and wildfires. All of these impacts  affect human health.   Older adults and their families and caregivers should  consider how the condition of their health and home  affects their exposure to the negative impacts of climate  change.   Illnesses Spread by Ticks or Mosquitoes   Climate change and increased temperatures will lead to  ticks and mosquitoes expanding their ranges and being  present for longer seasons. This means an increased risk  of being bitten by disease-carrying ticks and  mosquitoes. Lyme disease, which is spread by ticks, is  frequently reported in older adults. The West Nile and  St. Louis encephalitis viruses, which are spread by  mosquitoes, pose a greater health risk among older  adults with already weakened immune systems.   The Impact of Location   Depending on where they live, some older adults  can be more vulnerable to climate change-related  health effects than others. For example, about 20%  of older adults live in an area in which a hurricane or  tropical storm made landfall within the last 10 years.  The increasing severity of tropical storms may pose  risks for older adults living in coastal areas. For older  adults residing in cities, factors such as the urban  heat island effect, urban sprawl, and neighborhood  safety may also present risks. For older adults and  people with limited mobility who reside in  multi-story buildings with elevators, the loss of  electricity during a storm can make it difficult to get  food, medicine, and other needed services.   Poor Air Quality   Climate change worsens air quality because warming  temperatures make it easier for ground-level ozone to  form and can lengthen the season of aeroallergens like  ragweed pollen. Changing weather patterns and more  intense and frequent wildfires also raise the amount of  pollution, dust, and smoke in the air. These changes will  increase the number of emergency department visits  and hospital admissions, even for healthy older adults.  Poor air quality worsens respiratory conditions common  in older adults such as asthma and chronic obstructive  pulmonary disorder (COPD). Air pollution can also  increase the risk of heart attack in older adults,  especially those who are diabetic or obese.   Illnesses Caused by Contaminated Water   Climate change increases the contamination risk for  sources of drinking water and recreational water. Older  adults are at high risk of contracting gastrointestinal  illnesses from contaminated water. Those already in  poor health are more likely to suffer severe health  consequences including death. In 2013, almost 28% of  adults age 75 and older were described as in fair or  poor health, compared to 6% for adults age 18 to 44.   Extreme Heat   Climate change will increase extreme heat events and  lead to higher temperatures throughout the year.  Extreme heat exposure can increase the risk of illness  and death among older adults, especially people with  congestive heart failure, diabetes, and other chronic  health conditions that increase sensitivity to heat.  Higher temperatures have also been linked to increased  hospital admissions for older people with heart and  lung conditions. Older adults with limited incomes who  own air conditioning units may not use them during    heat waves due to the high cost to operate them.   Extreme Events   Climate change affects the frequency and intensity of  some extreme weather events, such as flooding  (related to heavy rains, hurricanes, and coastal storms),  droughts, and wildfires. Older adults are more likely to  suffer storm and flood-related fatalities. For example,  almost half of deaths from Hurricane Katrina were  people over age 75, while for Superstorm Sandy almost  half were over age 65. If an extreme event requires  evacuation, older adults have high risk of both physical  and mental health impacts. Some of the most  vulnerable are people with disabilities, with chronic  medical conditions, or living in nursing homes or  assisted-living facilities. Health impacts could be made  worse by interruptions in medical care and challenges  associated with transporting patients with their  necessary medication, medical records, and any  equipment like oxygen. Extreme events can also cause  power outages that can affect electrically-powered  medical equipment and elevators, leaving some  people without treatment or the ability to evacuate.

Here are some tips for  identifying, interviewing and working with one that is.    First, develop a short-list of pest control companies:        Consult on-line directories and reviews.         Ask for a referral from someone you may know who had a bed bug problem.          Refer to the following website to identify licensed pest control companies:   www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/structuralpest.htm.     Second, interview the companies on your short-list. Generally, good companies:       Will have received specialized training.        Will have experience and will be able to provide you with one or more references from   customers who have received their services.       Will provide services that include: an initial inspection, treatment, a follow-up inspection,   and re-treatments and follow-up inspections, as needed, to fully address the problem.        Will provide you with a detailed set of instructions to prepare your home or apartment for      inspection and treatment.     If the problem is within a multi-unit building, in addition to inspecting the unit with bed  bugs, will inspect units on either side, above and below that unit.        Will point out conditions that contribute to bed bugs.         Will provide you with a list of repairs that are needed and will indicate in the quote   whether those repairs are included.        Will provide you with a written inspection report.        Will provide you with information about the tools and methods they will use to inspect  and treat - an “integrated pest management” approach (i.e., one that uses a combination  of methods and not just chemicals alone) – is the best approach.        Will provide you with a quote based on inspection findings.         Will educate you on how to prevent bed bugs from coming back.     Third, be an active partner with the pest management company:    Bed Bugs_Pest Control Company Tips_Updated03062014           Follow their recommendations, especially the recommendations for preparing your home   or apartment for inspection and treatment.     Accompany them during the inspection - ask them to point out conditions that contribute   to bed bugs and ask them how to prevent bed bugs from coming back.

They  will  also  elect  ward committeemen in each of the City’s 50 wards. Some Chicago City Council members and  some City of Chicago employees will stand for election or re-election for the position of ward  committeeman in March 2016.    The  City’s  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  restricts  the  political  activity  of  all  City  employees  and  officials,  including  those  who  are  candidates  themselves,  or  those  who  wish  to  work  in  connection with any of these  upcoming elections.  Moreover, the Ordinance’s limitations on  campaign  contributions  also  apply  to  contributions  made  to  incumbent  City  elected  officials  who  are  running  for  ward  committeemen,  or  any  City  employees  who  are  running  for  that  office as well.            RESTRICTIONS ON POLITICAL ACTIVITY AND WORKING ON ANY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS.    For a summary of the restrictions imposed by City law on City personnel who wish to work in  connection  with  these  upcoming  elections,  see  the  Board’s  Plain  English  Guide  to  Political  Activity and Election Work, here:  http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/ethics/general/Publications/Pol-ACT- 2015.pdf    RESTRICTIONS ON POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO CANDIDATES FOR WARD COMMITTEEMAN.  The  office  of  ward  committeeman  is  not  a  City  elected  office.    It  is,  rather,  a  party  office,  established  under  the  Illinois  Election  Code.    Nonetheless,  the  City’s  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance applies to campaign contributions made to City elected officials or employees who  are also candidates for ward committeeman.  The Ordinance subject certain persons or entities  to a $1,500 annual cap on political contributions made to “any official or employee of the city  who is seeking election to any other [that is, non-City] office.”  See §2-156-445(a).       In Case No. 09058.Q, the Board addressed these issues. The gist of that decision is that if, for  example,  Alderman  John  Doe  of  the  51st  Ward  is  also  a  candidate  for  Democratic  ward  committeeman  of  his  ward,  then,  under  state  law,  he  must  establish  two  separate  committees—one for each elected office, that is, one for his aldermanic office, and a second for  his ward committeeman candidacy.  Thus, persons who are subject to the annual $1,500 cap on  political contributions* may contribute up to the $1,500 limit to each of his official committees  in a single calendar year—that is, $1,500 to “Doe for 51st Ward Alderman,” and another $1,500  to “Doe for Ward Committeeman,” for a total of $3,000 in a single calendar year.    Please do note, though: in Case No. 09058.Q, the non-City office in question involved both a  primary  and  a  general  election.    Each  candidacy,  the  primary  and  the  general  election,  are  considered separate, distinct candidacies, subject to a separate $1,500 contribution limit from  persons subject to that limit [in addition to being subject to a separate $1,500 per calendar year  limit  in  contributions  to  the  candidate’s  committee for  elected  City  office].    This  would have  enabled a contributor subject to the limits to contribute, in a single calendar year, $3,000 to the  non-City candidacy, and another $1,500 to the recipient’s aldermanic election committee.    However, the office of ward committeeman is decided in a single election, called the General  Primary.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,979 feet of 12-inch and 2,190 feet of 8-inch water main in W.  118th Street, from S. Wallace Street to S. Michigan Avenue, and in S.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       CY YOUNG IN ACTION           Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                      WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,979 feet of 12-inch  and 2,190 feet of 8-inch water main in W. 118th Street, from S. Wallace Street to S. Michigan  Avenue, and in S. Lafayette Avenue, from W. 116th Street to W. 119th Street.       Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in September. Final restoration will follow in October. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in September. Final  restoration will follow in October. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at  the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

The goal of accreditation is to im- prove and protect the health of the public  by advancing the quality and performance  of public health departments. The process  gives us the opportunity to critically review  our performance against nationally ap- proved standards, looking at nearly 100  measures. The attainment of our Healthy  Chicago goals requires a strong, perform- ance-driven health department. I am  proud to say we’re on our way to becom- ing one of the first accredited health de- partments in the country.            Bechara Choucair, M.D.  Commissioner of Health    HEALTHY CHICAGO IMPLEMENTATION     The UNITY (Urban Networks to In- crease Thriving Youth) network of  more than twelve cities, the Preven- tion Institute, and the U.S. Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  met in Oakland, CA in mid-October.    The group develops and shares effec- tive strategies to prevent violence  before it occurs. The Chicago delega- tion included the Mayor’s Office and  the Director of the CDPH Office of Vio- lence Prevention (OVP), who pre- sented on Chicago’s efforts to build  our capacity to prevent and/or treat  childhood exposure to violence (CEV)  and trauma.  (Violence Prevention)        CDPH public health nurse Cheryal Christion   providing flu shots at Daley College   The CDPH OVP Director and the  Mayor’s Office also participated in the  National Forum on Youth Violence Pre- vention – a cluster of  six municipalities  working to maximize federal support of  local strategically-aligned prevention  efforts.   That meeting was also at- tended by representatives from Chi- cago’s Police and Family and Support  Service Departments, and the Chicago  Public Schools. (Violence Prevention)   The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) re- cently announced plans to serve about  two million pounds of unprocessed  chicken this year.   This is part of an  ongoing effort to improve nutrition by  reducing processed foods and sodium  in school meals. The chicken will be  served twice a month  to more than  300,000 students at 473 schools.     (Heart Disease and Stroke; Obesity  Prevention)   A key strategy in Healthy Chicago is to  increase the amount of public health  data made available through the City  of Chicago website.  Earlier this month,  the health inspection data from  CDPH’s Food Protection division was  posted.   Currently there are over  32,000 reports of  inspections con-            P a g e   2                                                              H e a l t h y   C h i c a g o         N o v e m b e r   2 0 1 1    ducted of restaurants and other food establishments,  dating back to January 1, 2010.  New reports are added  weekly.   Inspection reports can be viewed at:  http://tinyurl.com/7vhjdsd. (Public Health Infra- structure)   CDPH recently signed a data use agreement for the  transfer of its first batch of public health data for inclu- sion in the Metropolitan Chicago Information Center’s   Chicago Health Atlas. Among the project’s goals are to  provide: a flexible and extensible data schema to align  demographic and population data, as well as an array of  health care service and program data; and a proof-of- concept web application to explore health data, demo- graphic data, and health interventions within a sub- municipal geographic unit of analysis. (Public Health  Infrastructure)     The Chicago Tobacco Prevention Project will be estab- lishing “cessation stations,” in a move to increase the  amount of  smoking cessation resources available to  city residents.  Cessation stations are designated private  or semi-private spaces that contain a phone that clients  can use to connect directly with the Illinois Tobacco  Quitline.  This effort makes cessation resources avail- able at all times and allows tobacco users the opportu- nity to  start the cessation process immediately. Five  stations will be located at sites serving persons at in- creased risk for tobacco use. The Jesse Brown VA Medi- cal Center was the first site to install a cessation station.  Both the Institute of Cultural Affairs and Haymarket  Center will install stations in November. (Tobacco Use)   CDPH  recently provided the first of several Tuberculo- sis (TB) 101 training sessions for community based  agencies that serve  populations at high risk for HIV/ AIDS.   Participants from  nine agencies learned how to  recognize TB symptoms, how to prevent the spread of  disease in their environments, and how to work with  the CDPH TB Program.  (Communicable Disease Control)                  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security recently  presented CDPH and the Chicago jurisdiction an Award  of Excellence for Outstanding Support of the BioWatch  Gen-3 Field Test.  The BioWatch Program is a federal  early warning system operating across the U.S. to de- tect the release of biological pathogens into the air and              provide warning to the government and public health  community of a potential bioterrorism event. (Public  Health Infrastructure)    The CDPH Immunization Program continued its 2011- 2012 Influenza Vaccination Campaign by hosting Chicago  Family Flu Day events at two City Colleges: Truman and  Kennedy-King Colleges.  To date in 2011, CDPH staff have  vaccinated more than 13,500 persons against the  flu.  For more information about upcoming opportunities  for getting a flu shot, visit www.cityofhicago.org/flu or  call 311.  (Communicable Disease Control and Preven- tion)   CDPH’s Public Health Emergency Preparedness Bureau  conducted the first exercise with long-term care facilities  to better prepare these sites to handle emergencies and  other events.   This was a citywide exercise with 26 long- term care facilities that took place in late October. Par- ticipating agencies tested their emergency communica- tions, emergency supply cache deployment, and inven- tory shipping and receiving capabilities. (Public Health  Infrastructure)     HEALTHY CHICAGO POLICY HIGHLIGHTS     In an effort to build on recent improvements to CDPH’s  Food Protection efforts, an ordinance was introduced at  the November 2nd City Council meeting to change the  criteria for food establishment inspection frequency, and  to initiate a self-inspection pilot project.  Specifically, the  schedule for inspections of a food establishment would  be based on whether that establishment was deemed at  low, medium, or high risk for violations.   This change will  allow sanitarians to focus efforts on those establish- ments which pose the greatest risk to  the public’s  health.  The self-inspection pilot project, one of the first  in the nation, would begin with no more than 2,500 low- risk establishments.  (Communicable Disease Control)      The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  (ACIP) voted on Tuesday, October 25 in support of a rou- tine HPV recommendation for boys aged 11-12 years.   Once approved by the CDC,  CDPH will work with the  Illinois Chapter,  American Academy of Pediatrics and the  Illinois Academy of Family Physicians to ensure health    To download your copy of Healthy Chicago, the City’s public health agenda, visit www.CityofChicago.org/Health      N o v e m b e r   2 0 1 1                      H e a l t h y   C h i c a g o       P a g e   3    care providers are aware of the new HPV recommenda- tion for boys.  (Adolescent Health;  Communicable Dis- ease Control)     HEALTHY CHICAGO GRANT NEWS    Partner Funding     On October 24, 2011 the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) announced approximately $42 mil- lion in grant awards to 500 federally-qualified health cen- ters (FQHCs) nationally to improve the coordination of  care and the quality of care delivered to Medicare benefi- ciaries.  The goal of this Advanced Primary Care Practice  demonstration, supported under the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act, is to help patients get the care  they need in a primary care setting rather than in an  emergency department.   Medicare payments can be used  to help patients manage chronic conditions like diabetes  or high blood pressure. FQHCs must use the funds to ex- pand their hours, make same day appointments, and ac- commodate patients with urgent care needs. In Chicago,  funding was awarded to 10 sites operated by Heartland  Health Outreach, Access Community Health Network,  Alivio Medical Center, Chicago Family Health Center, and  PCC Community Wellness Center.  (Access to Care)   CDPH recently awarded $30,000 in Reality Illinois funding  to support a teenager-created and implemented anti- tobacco movement.  Funded agencies include: Korean  American Resource and Cultural Center, Alliance for Com- munity Peace, Gads Hill Center, Healthcare Alternative  Systems, HOPE Organization, and the Better Boys Founda- tion. (Tobacco Use)    State funds totaling over $10M were recently awarded to  Heartland International Health Center, Erie Family Health  Centers, Lawndale Christian Health Center, and Asian Hu- man Services Family Health Center to build and renovate  community health centers in Chicago.  This expansion will  allow them to serve additional patients in spaces that  promote efficient and high quality care. (Access to Care)        CDPH Funding    CDPH received the following final annual awards from the Illi- nois Department of Human Services for State FY 2012 pro- grams:       $761K to support a range of mental health services to  low-income clients.  This continues the decline in di- rect state funding for mental health services, with the  bulk of funding moving to a fee for service reimburse- ment model. (Access to Care)   $536K to support substance abuse treatment con- tracts with six agencies providing opioid maintenance  therapy in day treatment centers. (Access to Care,  Violence Prevention)   $557K to support comprehensive health assessments,  appropriate follow-up, treatment, and referrals to  newly-arrived refugees. The program aims to control  communicable diseases among and resulting from the  arrival of new refugees. (Access to Care, Communica- ble Disease Control)   $96K for All Our Kids Early Childhood Networks to  improve the health outcomes of children ages 0 to 5  in the North Lawndale neighborhood.  Staff conduct  customer trainings with neighborhood family case  management agencies and WIC sites, and distribute  developmental screening campaign posters to partner  agencies.  (Healthy Mothers and Babies)   $2.1M to continue to provide intensive home visits  and case management services to low income families  at high risk of poor health outcomes and health dis- parities. (Healthy Mothers and Babies)   $799K to provide individuals with sufficient family  planning information and appropriate means to exer- cise personal choice in determining the number and  spacing of their children. (Healthy Mothers and Ba- bies)   $247K to conduct home visits and make referrals for  services and well-child care for young first-time moth- ers in the South Chicago neighborhood.  (Healthy  Mothers and Babies)   $143K to provide staff and educational materials  needed to ensure that all family planning clients are  tested for HIV and supplied with the test results, with  all HIV+ clients referred directly to early treatment  services and prevention with positives education.

Adopt a land use map for the Fulton Market Innovation District   to minimize future land use conflicts and maximize the  production of real and virtual products   2. Establish Subdistrict B within the Kinzie Planned   Manufacturing District   3. Adopt general design guidelines  4. Coordinate public infrastructure investments to create a   cohesive district identity and support ongoing private  investment projects.    5. Invest in facilities for regional food products, traditional  wholesale businesses and associated historic buildings   6. Encourage programming and events on food and Chicago’s   role within the regional and nationwide food systems   7. Establish a historic district within a portion of the Fulton   Market Innovation District   FMID Key Actions               Purpose:  provide adequate space for a broader range  of businesses, while still protecting against the  potentially negative impacts of housing, entertainment,  and lodging uses.     New tools to meet the same   purpose, and strengthen  industrial and commercial  corridors citywide:   Zoning Overlay District to  guide new development  and expand business uses   Industrial Corridor System   Fund    Neighborhood   Opportunity Fund   Proposed Zoning Changes (East Kinzie)   1   4.

The new laws are effective January 1, 2018.    The new laws include significant changes to scheduled taxicab vehicle inspections, including  scheduled change of equipment inspections.       Starting January 1, 2018, taxicab vehicles with a vehicle age of FIVE years or newer will be    scheduled for one annual inspection.  Taxicab vehicles with a vehicle age of SIX years or older      will be scheduled semiannually or two inspections per year.                                 Taxicab Vehicle Age ≤ 5 years = 1 annual scheduled inspection    Taxicab Vehicle Age ≥ 6 years = 2 semi-annual scheduled inspections                  Vehicles with a vehicle age of 5 years or newer will be scheduled for one vehicle inspection in  2018 – the vehicle inspection date could fall within the first period (January to June) or second      period (July to December).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND PROCEDURAL RULINGS   a.  The Complaint, Default Order and Hearings Scheduled   Complainants filed  Complaints against Respondents on March 3,  2006, alleging that they  were discriminated against by Respondents in a public accommodation.  The Commission ordered  the  Respondents to  file  Verified  Responses to  the  Complaints.  On April  6,  2006,  Complainant  Blakemore  filed  an  additional  Complaint  (CCHR  No.  06-P-24)  alleging  retaliation  by  the  Respondents for filing his original Complaint, dnring a subsequent visit to the establishment. When  the  Respondents  failed  without  good  cause  shown  to  file  and  serve  Verified  Responses  to  the  Complaints in CCHR Nos.  06-P-12  to  15  as  required  by  CCHR Reg.  210.210,  the  Commission  issued a Notice of Potential Default on April 13, 2006, and mailed it to the Respondents.  When the  Respondents  also  failed  without  good  cause  shown  to  file  and  serve  Verified  Responses  to  the  retaliation complaint in CCHR No.  06-P-24, the Commission issued a Notice of Potential Default  on May I 0, 2006 and mailed it to the Respondents. When the Respondents further failed to respond  to the Notices of Potential Default, the Commission issued an Order of Default for all Complaints  on July 15, 2006.   By their failure to respond to the Notices ofPotential Default, the Respondents were deemed  to  have  admitted  the  allegations  of the  Complaints  on  both  the  discriminatory  action  and  the  retaliatory action and to have waived any defenses to the allegations ofthose Complaints, including  defenses concerning the Complaints' sufficiency.  CCHR Reg.  215.240.   The Commission held a Pre-Hearing Conference in this case on October 12,2006,  at 9:30  a.m.  in the Commission's offices.  Respondent Casie Ernst, manager of the Cold Stone Creamery  store, did not appear, nor has there been any response from Ms.  Ernst to  any Commission order.  Complainant Bishop T.  T.  Turner was  late to this Pre-Hearing Conference.  Complainant Turner   stated at the time that he did not get notice of the Pre-Hearing Conference; he had moved and had  not kept the Commission informed of his new address as  required  by  CCHR Reg.  No.  235.110. 1  Complainant Turner appeared at the Pre-Hearing Conference because the other Complainants had  informed him  of the  date.  The  Notice of the Pre-Hearing  Conference  date  and  other procedural  matters sent to Complainant Turner had been returned to the Hearing Officer marked ""forward time  expired, return to sender.""   At  the  Pre-Hearing  Conference,  the  Complainants  were  notified  of  the  date  of  the  administrative hearing and  the  fact  that all  parties were  to  appear promptly for  the  hearing.  The  parties were also informed that the hearing ordered in this case was to be held only for the purpose  of allowing the Complainants to establish their prima facie  case and appropriate relief,  including  injunctive relief, damages, fines,  and  any attorneys fees  and/or costs.  CCHR Reg.  215.240.  All  factual  allegations  of the  Complaints  subsequent  to  an  Order  of Default must  be  taken  as  true;  Complainants were  still required to  establish a prima facie  case  in order for  the  Commission to  award damages.  Horn  v.  A-Aero 24 Hour Locksmith eta/., CCHR 99-PA-32 (July 19, 2000).   On the date  of the hearing,  Complainants  Blakemore,  Shepard,  and  Evans  as well as the  owners of  Respondent Bitritto  Enterprises, Inc.,  doing  business as  Cold  Stone Creamery #0430  (hereinafter referred to  as ""Cold Stone Creamery #0430""), arrived in a timely fashion at or before  9:30a.m..  Respondent Casie Ernst, store manager of Cold Stone Creamery #0430, did not appear,  nor did she notify the  Commission of any just cause for  her failure  to  appear.  In  response to an  inquiry by the Hearing Officer, Complainant Blakemore stated that Complainant Turner would arrive  by 10:00 a.m., but he did not do  so;  this is discussed below.  Tr., 5. 2   b .  Complainant Blakemore's Motion for Continuance   Complainant Blakemore arrived at the hearing with an attorney whom he had retained the  day before, Mecca Thompson.  Complainant Blakemore's attorney sought a continuance in order to  prepare  for  the  hearing.  The  Hearing  Officer denied  this  continuance, noting that  Complainant  Blakemore had known about the date ofthe hearing since an order setting the hearing date was sent  by the Commission on Jnly 7, 2006. Tr.,  3-5.  Complainant Blakemore had further been informed  about the date ofthe hearing by the Hearing Officer by order dated July 17, 2006.  When asked what  were the extraordinary circumstances that would support a motion for continuance on the morning  a hearing was to commence, Complainant Blakemore's sole answer was ""finance."" Tr., 4. No further  evidence was offered.   Pursuant to  the discretion granted to  the Hearing Officer in CCHR Reg.  No.  240.391, the   1 "" A  Complainant has the responsibility to promptly provide the Commission with notice of any change in   address  or prolonged absence from  a current address so that he or she can be located when necessary at  any time  while the Complainant's case is pending before the Commission ... . ""   2AI!  references to the otticial transcript will be labeled ""Tr., x.""  All references to the Complaint will be   labeled ""C. ~x.""   2    Hearing  Officer denied  the  motion  to  continue  the  hearing  as  not  being  reasonable  under  the  circumstances, but did allow Complainant Blakemore's attorney to have time to  attempt to settle  this matter and to review the case file to determine ifthere were any documents not previously given  to her by her client.  The Commission has continued cases where a complainant has shown he was  diligent in seeking counsel, but no such evidence was offered in this case.  See Scott v.  Noble Horse,  CCHR No. 92-E-153 (Sep. 22, 1993) (continuance allowed where complainant had been diligent in  seeking counsel); Ferguson v.  EWS Tailoring & Fashion Academy et al., CCHR 98-E-147 (June 3,  1999) (continuance denied where motion filed less than 7 days before the hearing, ""extraordinary  circwnstances""  not  shown,  and  counsel's  inability  to  devote  sufficient  effort  to  case  does  not  constitute good cause to delay hearing).  Sec also Blakemore v. Star bucks Coffee Co.,  CCHR No.  97-PA-99 (Feb. 24,  1999) (Board upheld Hearing Officer's denial of Complainant's request for a  continuance ofthe hearing, as Complainant did not make the request until the day ofthe hearing, as  he had not shown due diligence to find an attorney, and as sanctions already imposed meant having  an attorney would not have been meaningful).   Complainant Blakemore's motion for a continuance was denied.  The hearing reconvened  when Complainant Blakemore's attorney stated that they were unable to settle the case and she had  reviewed the case file.  The hearing began again at approximately 10:30 a.m.  Complainant Turner  had not appeared.   c.  Dismissal of the Complaint of Bishop T.T. Turner   At ll :30 a.m. on the date ofthe hearing, Complainant Turner appeared at the hearing talking  on his cell phone as he entered the hearing room.  The Hearing Officer asked him to turn offhis cell  phone and to explain why he was two hours late to the scheduled hearing that he had been informed  about at  the  Pre-Hearing Conference.  Tr.,  33.  Complainant Turner  responded in an  aggressive  manner that he had not received any documents from the Hearing Officer, who reminded him that  he had been personally informed about the time of the hearing at the Pre-Hearing Conference and  had been admonished to be on time. Tr., 34-35.  Complainant Turner responded, ""I was on the road  all ni ght driving to  get here.  Now I don ' t need no hassle about my being here.""  Tr., 35.   The Hearing Officer noted that Complainant Turner had his cell phone with him, as it was  with  him  as  he  walked  into  the  hearing  room  and  had  been  with  him  during  the  Pre-Hearing  Conference. Tr.,  36.  The Hearing Officer noted that Complainant Turner had not called to notify  U1e Commission that he was going to be late.  Based on Complainant Turner's lateness, his lack of  extraordinary circumstances  to justify  that lateness, his disrespect shown to  the process and the  Hearing Officer, and his previous incidents ofdisrespect for the Commission's procedures and rules,  the Hearing Officer dismissed Complainant Turner's complaint.  Tr., 37-47.   Complainant Turner and the Hearing Officer had a lengthy discussion about her decision, a  discussion that was heated, loud, and occasionally profane on the part of Complainant Turner. Tr.,  37-47.  Toward the end ofthis discussion, Complainant Turner asked again why his case was being  dismissed.  In response to the Hearing Officer's statement that his case was being dismissed because   3    he  was two hours late  without any evidence of good cause,  Complainant Turner stated, ""This is  Chicago,  baby.""  Tr.,  43.  Citing  Chicago  traffic  as  an  excuse  when  all  other  parties  had  come  promptly to  the  hearing  is  not  a  sufficient  excuse,  particularly when viewed  in  the  context that  Complainant Turner had not cooperated with the Commission's Regulations by failing to inform the  Commission of his  current address,  being  late  to  the  previous  Pre-Hearing  Conference,  and  not  seeking to notify the Commission personally that he was unavoidably detained for the hearing.   Reg. 240.398 (""Failure to Appear"") ofthe Commission's Rules and Regulations provides that  if a party fails to attend a hearing and the failure is not excused for good cause, the Hearing Officer  may enter an  Order dismissing the Complaint for  failing to  cooperate.  Citing heavy traffic as a  reason  for  being  two  hours  late  cannot  by  any definition  be  good cause,  particularly where  the  Complainant  did  not  attempt  to  contact  the  Commission  despite  having  a  cell  phone.  Reg.  235.120(b) (""Failure to Cooperate"") provides that after the commencement of a hearing a hearing  officer may sua sponte dismiss a complainant's case for failure to cooperate.  Arriving two hours late  without any good excuse- especially when this Complainant had a history of failing to  abide by  Commission  rules  - is  clearly  failure  to  cooperate  and  shows  a  remarkable  disrespect  for  the  Commission, his fellow Complainants, the Respondents, and the Commission's process.  Showing  that kind of disrespect to the Regulations and the Commission participants has been held to be an  adequate reason for dismissing a case.  Blakemore v. AMC-GCT, Inc., CCHR No. 03-P-14 (Apr. 21,  2006).  See also Karlin v.  Chicago Board ofEducation,  et al.,  CCHR No.  95-E-62 (Dec. 8, 2000)  (in  declining  to  dismiss  case,  CHR cites  prior decisions  which  hold that  dismissal  is  a  ""severe  sanction which should not be entered in a punitive manner, especially where the underlying omission  was due to error, not disregard for the Commission's procedures"").   Complainant  Turner's  case  is  dismissed.   In  response  to  the  motion  of Complainant  Blakemore's counsel,  Complainant Turner was allowed to stay in the hearing to  act as  a witness.  Tr. 39-40.   d.  Motion by Complainant Blakemore to  Add a Respondent   Commission  Reg.  210.120  (""Filing  of Complaint"")  provides  that  it  is  a  complainant's  responsibility to  identify the  individuals and/or other entities the complainant wishes to  name as  respondents.  These entities include including corporations and agents. See Commission Reg.  I 00  (25).  The corporate franchisor was not named as a respondent by Complainant Blakemore in his  initial complaint.  C.   After  he  had  filed  his  Complaint with  the  Commission,  Complainant Blakemore  orally  contacted the Commission and sought to have the Commission add the corporate franchisor to the  proceedings.  Commission Reg.  210.160 (d) provides that a request to add a respondent before the  hearing must be in writing; requests at the hearing may he made orally unless the Hearing Officer  requires  it  to  be  in writing.  Complainant Blakemore never  filed  a  written  motion  to  amend his  complaint to add an additional party, as is required by Commission regulations.  Prior to the Hearing  Officer being appointed, Complainant Blakemore's oral request to add the corporate franchisor was   4    denied by the Commission as Complainant Blakemore had not followed Commission regulations. 3   At the hearing, Complainant Blakemore's counsel sought to preserve for appeal Complainant  Blakemore's  position  that the  corporate franchisor  should  be  a  named  party.4  Tr.,  8.  Neither  Complainant Blakemore  nor  his  attorney  presented  any  evidence  of the  corporate  relationship  between any corporation and the Respondent Cold  Stone Creamery #0430. One of the owners of  Cold Stone Creamery #0430 testified that they were a franchisee. Tr., 70.  The Respondent described  the relationship as follows:   Cold Stone Creamery [the franchisor] creates the idea, the concept of the ice cream that we  serve and then individuals have the opportunity to invest in a business that they give you all  the plans to, how to  process, and move forward  with business.   Tr., p. 70.   The owner of Respondent Cold Stone Creamery #0430 also testified that he sent a copy of  the complaint to and contacted the corporate franchisor, who informed him that the corporation was  not named and the matter was between the owners ofRespondent Cold Stone Creamery #0430 and  the  Complainants.  Tr.,  69-7 1.  That is  the sum  total  of any  evidence of the relationship  of the  Respondent Cold Stone Creamery #0430 with any corporation.  Complainant Blakemore's attorney  did not ask any additional questions to establish the kind of relationship the Respondent Cold Stone  Creamery #0430 had with its corporate franchisee.   There  is  a  ""certain degree  of control  is  inherent  in any franchise  agreement.""  Mann  v.  Prudential Real Estate Affiliates, Inc.,  1990 WL 205286, *3 (Ill.  1990).  However, the ""clear trend  in case law . . . is that the quality and operational standards and  inspection rights contained in a  franchise agreement do not establish a franchisor's control or right of control over the franchisee  sufficient to ground a claim for vicarious liability as a general matter or for all  purposes.""  Kerl v.  Rasmus en, 273 Wis.2d 106,  L 26-127 (Wis. 2004) and cases cited therein.  In Slates v.  Jnt'l Jlouse  of Pancakes,  Inc., 90  Ill.App.3d  716 (Ill.  1980),  no  agency relationship  was found  between the  franchisor and franchisee, despite the fact that the franchisor maintained control over the items and  products to be sold, training and supervision of franchisees, store managers and advertising and the  appearance of the store, its employees, and food preparation.  !d.  at 727.   At  least  one  federal  court  has  considered  whether  a  franchise  agreement  provides  for  sufficient control by the franchisor to be held liable under a federal accommodations statute.  The  court in  Neffv. American Dairy Queen  Corp., 58 F.3d 1063  (5th Cir.  1995) considered whether a  franchisor  which  bad  control  over  such  things  as  accounting,  personnel  uniforms  and  use  of   3c omplainant Blakemore has fi led numerous complaints with the Commission and should be well aware of   the regu lations and the requirements to  review and follow them.   4At no time did Complainant Blakemore's attorney specifically move to add the corporate franchisor as a   Respondent; her sole request was to ""preserve that for appeal.""  Tr., 8.   5    18.  Complainant Shepard said that he and Complainant Blakemore had often gone to the Cold Stone  Creamery #0430 prior to this incident and loved the store and the ice cream.  Tr. 84-85.  He felt that  the problem was with the manager; he did not know what the source of her problem was.  Tr.  85.  Complainant Blakemore had recommended going to  Cold Stone Creamery #0430.  Tr.  22.   19.  Cold Stone Creamery #0430 is owned and operated by Bitritto Enterprises, Inc., whose owners  are Constantino Taccogna and Theresa Tacconga, who are husband and wife. Tr.  72.  Constantino  Taccogna is an immigrant to this country; Theresa Tacconga is Hispanic.  Tr.  74-75.   20.  When the Complaints were sent by the Chicago Commission on Human Relations to Cold Stone  Creamery #0430, they were received by the manager.  The manager did not notify the Taccognas that  Complaints had been filed.  Tr. 72-73.  The manager did not show the Complaints to the Taccognas  until  after the  Order of Default was  entered.  Tr.  73.  When the Taccognas  became  aware of the  situation,  they  terminated  the  manager's  employment.  Tr.  72.  She  no  longer  works  for  their  organization.  Tr.  72.   21.  The Taccognas talked with the manager about the Complaints and showed her the Complaints.  Tr.  73.  The Taccognas also left telephone messages about the scheduled hearings, but the manager  did not returned their phone calls.  Tr.  73.   22.  The Taccognas do not tolerate the kind of behavior the Complainants complained happened in  their establishment.  They have policies on how to  treat people equally.  Tr.  74-76, 79.   23.  Cold Stone Creamery #0430 is a franchise operation.  Tr. 70.  The corporate franchisor of Cold  Stone Creamery #0430 created the concept of the ice crean1 and gives franchisees the plans for the  ice cream and how to run the business.  Tr.  70.   24.  Commission records show that it mailed Respondent Notification packets to Respondents on  or about March I 0, 2006.  The mailings included copies ofthe Complaints numbered 06-P-12, 06-P­ 13, 06-P-14, and 06-P-15.  Two copies were sent, to each of the following addresses:   Cold Stone Creamery  c/o Owner or Manager  1533 N.  Wells  Chicago, IL  60610   Cold Stone Creamery  c/o Stacy, Manager  1533  N.  Wells  Chicago, IL 60610   IIJ.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW   I.  The Chicago Human Rights Ordinance prohibits discrimination in public accommodations on the  basis of race.  The Chicago Human Rights Ordinance, Section 2-160-070, states in part:   No person that  owns,  leases rents,  operates,  manages  or in any manner controls a public  accommodation shall withhold, deny,  curtail, limit or discriminate concerning the full  usc   10    "

Mayor  Emanuel  is  committed  to  making  Chicago  the  nation’s  most  immigrant- friendly city and has worked to improve the day-to-day experiences of our city’s 560,000 foreign-born  residents, while delivering economic, social, and cultural benefits for all Chicagoans.    •   Introduced  the  Welcoming  City  Ordinance.  In  September  2012,  City  Council  approved  Mayor  Emanuel’s Welcoming City Ordinance, which expanded the City’s current policy that bans agencies  and police officers from inquiring into the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses, or anyone  seeking  City  services  to  ensure  that  undocumented  Chicagoans  will  only  be  detained  if  they  are  wanted  on  a  criminal  warrant  by  local  or  federal  authorities  or  if  they  have  been  convicted  of  a  serious crime and remain in the United States illegally.     •  Established  the  Office  of  New  Americans.    The  Office  of  New  Americans  (ONA)  is  dedicated  to  improving  services  and  engaging  Chicago’s  global  immigrant  communities  through  enhanced  collaboration with community organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector. Through  2   the  creation  of  the  ONA,  the  City  has  affirmed  and  strengthened  its  support  for  immigrant  communities, entrepreneurs, and businesses. It’s the first time the City has had an office dedicated  to immigrant integration.      •  Created  the  New  Americans  Advisory  Committee.  The  New  Americans  Advisory  Committee  is  comprised  of  50  leaders  representing  Chicago’s  business,  academic,  civic,  and  philanthropic  communities.  The  committee  will  identify  challenges  and  barriers  to  immigrant  integration  and  recommend strategies and solutions for integrating Chicago’s immigrants.      •  Created  the  Chicago  New  Americans  Plan.  In  December  2012,  Mayor  Emanuel  announced  the  release  of  the  Chicago  New  Americans  Plan.  The  plan,  the  first  of  its  kind  in  the  country,  is  a  comprehensive immigrant integration plan that recommends a broad array of new programs and  initiatives,  which  are  designed  to  improve  the  day-to-day  lives  of  immigrants  while  promoting  Chicago’s economic growth and cultural vitality.      Our Growth               As we build a 21st century economy, we must work together to attract and retain immigrants by helping  them to succeed and grow in a safe and welcoming city.   •  Expanded  ESL  and  GED  offsite  locations.  Through  a  partnership  between  the  City  Colleges  of  Chicago and community based organizations, 31 new locations are now open in neighborhoods from  Brighton Park to Avondale, supporting adults looking to earn a GED, improve their English language  skills or become college ready.    •  Started the New Americans Small Business Series.  The New Americans Small Business Series is a  series of quarterly events that foster small business growth in immigrant communities throughout  Chicago  by  creating  temporary  one-stop-shops  in  community  settings.  Immigrants  in  Chicago  are  50%  more  likely  to  open  up  a  small  business  and  the  one-stop-shops  will  ease  the  process  by  providing technical advice on how to start a small business, navigate the licensing process, comply  with tax laws, interact with chambers of commerce, and access capital.     •  Created  the  Restaurant  Startup  Guide  and  made  it  accessible  to  Latino  entrepreneurs.  The  restaurant  start  up  guide  and  program  make  the  process  of  opening  up  a  business  in  Chicago  smarter.    The  program  streamlines  the  application  process  and  ensures  restaurants  undergo  the  necessary zoning and location reviews up front, minimizing the risk that owners will need to make  expensive  course  corrections.  Providing  the  guide  and  multiple  other  languages  ensures  that  we  remove one of the biggest barriers immigrants face when opening a business: language access.      •  Co-launched  the  Illinois  Business  Immigration  Coalition  (IBIC).  The  coalition  will  consist  of  bipartisan  business  leaders,  business  groups,  trade  associations,  and  immigrant  rights  groups  to  reach both parties in Congress to enact legislation that will provide Illinois companies with both the  high-skilled and low-skilled talent that they need, and promote the integration of immigrants into  our  economy  as  consumers,  workers,  and  entrepreneurs  with  a  path  to  legal  status  and  full  citizenship.       3   Our Youth      By  working  with  community-based  organizations,  Chicago  Public  Schools  (CPS),  the  City  Colleges  of  Chicago  (CCC)  and  other  key  stakeholders,  Mayor  Emanuel  has  taken  steps  to  help  immigrant  youth  succeed  in  high  school  and  college.  Within  Chicago  Public  Schools,  16.3%  of  students  are  English  Language  Learners  (ELL),  and  over  19,000  students  under  age  18  are  undocumented  immigrants.  In  addition, the Mayor remains committed to providing high-quality early childhood education for all of  Chicago’s children.    •   Improved  Early  Learning Support  for  Immigrant  Children.  As  suggested  in  response  to  the  City’s  question on how to better support our youngest learners on CHIdeas, the online community forum,  the  City  will  develop  comprehensive  early  education  support  for  immigrant  children  and  their  families. This initiative will include parent engagement efforts and support for families navigating  early education opportunities to determine the best fit for their children. The Department of Family  and Support Services invested $325,000 for this effort.   The City of Chicago’s Support for Undocumented Students     In Chicago, it is estimated that over 19,000 students under age 18 are undocumented, and about 28,000  young adults ages 18-24 are undocumented. 1 City Colleges of Chicago also estimates that between 5- 15% of all students are undocumented. Since taking office, Mayor Emanuel, along with City of Chicago,  Chicago Public Schools, and City Colleges of Chicago staff, have launched a series of initiatives that  improve undocumented student’s access to resources and higher education.      Created the Chicago STAR Scholarship. In October 2014, Mayor Emanuel and Chancellor Hyman  Announced the Chicago STAR Scholarship, which will provide qualifying CPS students the opportunity to  earn an Associate Degree with no out of pocket costs. Building on the efforts to make Chicago America’s  most immigrant-friendly city, this STAR scholarship opportunity is open all undocumented students.     Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Initiatives   •  As part of the Chicago New Americans Plan, and in collaboration with community-based   4             organizations and legal services providers, CPS counselors and career coaches are being trained  to support undocumented student success.  CPS is the first school system in the country that  requires this training, and over 400 participants have already been trained to date.   Launched in 2013 by the Office of College and Career Success, the CPS Dream Fund provides  scholarships to assist talented undocumented CPS students in their quest to pursue a post- secondary education and is funded largely by donations from CPS staff.    •   •  CPS regularly hosts DREAMers Forums and Conferences to provide students and families with   information about college access and financial aid.   •  CPS has created a scholarship guide for students and includes a list of scholarships that are open   to undocumented students.                                                                 1 http://icirr.org/sites/default/files/Illinois%20undocumented%20report_0.pdf   •  CPS has a section of their “Choose Your Future” website for students focused on college-going   resources for undocumented students  https://www.chooseyourfuture.org/college/undocumented-students      City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) Initiatives   •  95% of privately funded scholarships at CCC do not request or require US citizenship.  •  Recipients of Illinois DREAM Fund scholarships can attend College to Careers programs at CCC.   •  Through a partnership between the CCC and community based organizations, 34 new locations  are now open in neighborhoods from Brighton Park to Avondale, supporting adults looking to  earn a GED, improve their English language skills or become college ready.    •  CCC held 3 Workshops at Truman, Wright, and Daley College in Fall 2012 in response to   Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), assisting over 150 CCC students to receive  protection against deportation and 2-year renewable legal work authorization.   •  Over 20 free drop-in legal screening sessions took place at CCC during 2013 for over 100   students to receive free, confidential review to determine eligibility to apply for Deferred Action  for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or other form of immigration relief.      Illinois DREAM Fund   In August 2012, Mayor Emanuel secured $275,000 in private donations for the Illinois DREAM  Fund. With this donation, nearly 100 undocumented students are able to complete their first  year in City Colleges of Chicago’s College to Career program, ensuring that they have the skills to  meet the demand for careers in growing fields.   In January 2013, Mayor Emanuel announced that $100,000 of the $275,000 privately raised  donations to the Illinois DREAM Fund would be used to grant scholarships to undocumented  JROTC students throughout the State of Illinois.      City of Chicago Internships and Job Opportunities   In April 2014, Mayor Emanuel announced that it will begin accepting applications from  undocumented youth for approximately 500 City internships, volunteer, and job opportunities  offered year-round, 30 Mayor’s Office Fellowships, as well as more than 22,000 opportunities to  participate in summer jobs, internships and job training programs offered through the One  Summer Chicago program.   Launched  a  Youth  Summer  Job  Program  to  Engage  Communities  on  President  Obama’s  Executive  Actions  on  Immigration.  Building  on  the  success  of  the  One  Summer  Chicago  initiative, Mayor Emanuel and DFSS created a new summer jobs program for DACA beneficiaries,  as well as other Chicago youth, to conduct civic outreach and disseminate information in their  communities  about  the  application  process  for  the  programs  provided  for  under  President  Obama’s November 2014 executive actions on immigration.     •   •   •   •        Our Communities         •  Passed a Language Access Ordinance. In April 2015, City Council approved the City’s first Language  Access  Ordinance,  ensuring  that  immigrants  and  limited-English-proficient  (LEP)  residents  have      5   meaningful  access  to  City  services,  resources,  and  programs  in  the  top  five  languages  spoken  in  Chicago, including Spanish, Polish, Mandarin, Hindi, and Arabic.      •  Established  a  Municipal  ID  Working  Group.  In  June  2015,  Mayor  Emanuel  formally  launched  a  working  group  that  will  be  tasked  with  exploring  whether  the  City  of  Chicago  should  pursue  a  Municipal ID program that can be used to connect Chicago residents with City services, programs,  and benefits, regardless of immigration status, homeless status, or gender identify.      The City of Chicago’s Efforts to Increase Naturalization Rates      •   •     •   Launched  Cities  for  Citizenship.  Mayor  Emanuel  partnered  with  Los  Angeles  Mayor  Eric  Garcetti  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Citi to jointly launch Cities for Citizenship, which will enable  cities to expand naturalization and financial capability programs, access to legal assistance, as well  as  microloans  and  financial  counseling,  boosting  economic  opportunity  for  immigrants  and  communities nationwide.  Chicago secured $250,000 in funding from Citigroup to expand citizenship  corners at ten Chicago Public Library branches in partnership with community organizations that will  provide workshops, legal screenings, and financial literacy information sessions at these branches.     Launched  the  Chicago  New  Americans  Initiative.  The  Chicago  New  Americans  Initiative    offers  naturalization assistance to 10,000 eligible, law abiding, permanent residents in Chicago through a  collaboration of the City, state, and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights      •  Supported  a  Reduction  in  Citizenship  Fees.  Mayor  Emanuel  and  Congressman  Luis  Gutierrez  are  calling on USCIS to review their fees and create a common-sense fee structure to ensure that eligible  permanent  legal  residents  who  are  already  in  this  country  don’t  have  their  path  to  citizenship  blocked by onerous fees.    Launched  Citizenship  Corners  at  Chicago  Public  Libraries.  Citizenship  Corners  are  a  result  of  a  partnership  between  the  Mayor’s  Office,  Chicago  Public  Libraries,  and  US  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services  (USCIS)  to  host  citizenship  workshops  and  disseminate  information  on  the  naturalization process at select Chicago Public Library locations. Known as “Citizenship Corners “and  “Citizenship Hubs,” the program will be one of the first of its kind and most comprehensive in the  nation  and  a  crucial  resource  to  help  residents  obtain  resources  and  guidance  on  the  citizenship  process.     •  Hosted Naturalization Ceremonies in City Hall. In June 2012, Mayor Emanuel hosted the first ever  Citizenship  swearing-in  ceremony  in  Chicago’s  City  Council  Chambers,  in  which  25  Chicagoans  become naturalized citizens. These ceremonies have been an ongoing occurrence, highlighting the  city’s  pride  in  our  immigrant  communities,  and  Mayor  Emanuel  has  hosted  eight  ceremonies  to  date.     Joined  Coalition  of  Mayors  to  Support  President  Obama’s  Executive  Actions  on  Immigration.  In  April  2015,  Mayor  Emanuel  and  the  City  of  Chicago  joined  73  cities  and  counties,  the  National  League of Cities, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors in filing a friend of the Court (Amicus) brief in  the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals expressing their support of President Obama’s executive actions on  immigration.    •      6      •  Coordinated City’s Efforts on Administrative Relief. Mayor Emanuel worked alongside Congressman   Gutierrez, City departments and community partners across various sectors to disseminate  information about the President’s recent executive actions on immigration, protect consumers from  fraudulent immigration service providers, and assist thousands of residents to take advantage of  administrative relief. In December of 2014, Mayor Emanuel and Congressman Gutierrez hosted the  first of many large scale workshops with over 600 people attending and receiving information about  how they may qualify and prepare for Administrative Relief.      •   Instituted  a  Policy  to  Accept  TVDL’s  at  all  Chicago  Public  Libraries.  In  September  2014,  Mayor  Emanuel announced that Chicago Public Libraries will now accept all forms of State ID, including the  Temporary  Visitor  Driver's  License  (TVDL),  to  issue  library  cards  to  residents  so  that  all Chicago  Public Libraries, their books, information, and programs, are made accessible to every residents of  Chicago, regardless of his or her immigration status.         •  Made  Chicago  a  Safe  Haven  for  Unaccompanied  Children.  In  consultation  with  the  federal  government,  the  Emanuel  Administration  worked  with  local  organizations  to  create  space  for  hundreds  of  additional  unaccompanied  children  migrants  fleeing  violence  in  Central  America.  To  ensure  that  children  that  are  currently  sheltered  in  the  Chicago  area  have  strengthened  legal  representation,  the  Mayor  allocated  $100,000  in  matching  funds  from  the  2015  City  Budget  to  match a federal grant that will provide additional legal services via the national Immigrant Children’s  Defense Corps, an initiative of the Justice AmeriCorps program. Should the need arise to open up  additional temporary shelters, Chicago will continue to remain in the mix as a welcoming city.    Launched  an  Immigration  Fraud  Enforcement  Campaign.  In  March  of  2013,  the  Department  of  Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) targeted 54 known immigration service providers  and found that 44 percent of the businesses visited by City inspectors were not in compliance with  the  City  ordinance  regulating  immigration  service  providers.  These  businesses  violated  consumer  protection requirements strengthened by Mayor Emanuel’s licensing reform ordinance, which the  City Council authorized in May 2012.   Launched  Chicago  Earned  Income  Tax  Credit  (EITC)  Campaign.  Many  hard-working  families  are  missing  out on  thousands of  dollars every year  at  tax  time,  and  Mayor  Emanuel  is  committed  to  ensuring that the EITC puts money back in the pockets of working people by launching the Chicago  EITC  campaign  to  promote  participation  in  the  City’s  free  Tax  Preparation  Assistance Program.  In  partnership  with  the  Center  for  Economic  Progress,  and  Ladder  Up,  the  City’s  program  assisted  23,000 working families with free tax preparation assistance in English and Spanish at 20 sites across  the city.        7     •     •
