Sedgwick, Suite 400, Chicago, IL 60654     Phone 312/744-4111, Fax 312/744-1081, TTY 312/744-1088   www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations           Información para Operadores Comerciales   QUÉ HACER SI UNA QUEJA DE DISCRIMINACIÓN   SE PRESENTÓ EN SU CONTRA     Como operador de un negocio en Chicago, usted está sujeto a las leyes que prohíben la discriminación.  Chicago tiene su propia Ordenanza de Derechos Humanos y Ordenanza de Equidad de Vivienda.  La Ley  de Derechos Humanos de Illinois y las leyes federales de derechos civiles también pueden aplicar a su  negocio.    La Ciudad quiere que los propietarios de negocios y propiedades conozcan estas leyes pare que (1) usted  podrá cumplir con las leyes, (2) usted evitará demandas de discriminación contra usted o su negocio, y (3)  que sus empleados y clientes serán protegidos de prácticas discriminatorias.    La queja no es una decisión que usted ha discriminado.  Cualquier persona puede presentar una queja alegando una violación de los Derechos Humanos o la Ordenanza de  Equidad de Vivienda.  La aceptación de una queja no significa que la Comisión ha decidido que se ha producido una  violación.  La presentación de una queja sólo inicia el proceso de decidir el caso. Los procedimientos para recibir,  investigar y adjudicar las quejas de discriminación en virtud de las Ordenanzas de Derechos Humanos y Equidad de  Vivienda  de  Chicago  se  indican  en  la  Sección  2-120-510  (e) -  (q)  del  Código  Municipal  de  Chicago  y  con  más  detalle en los reglamentos de la Comisión.    Debe responder a la queja.  Si se presenta una queja en contra de su negocio o de forma individual, debe responder a ella por escrito. Esta es su  oportunidad de contar su versión de la historia y ayudar con la investigación.  Si usted no presenta una respuesta  oportuna y completa, la Comisión podrá (a) ordenar que lo haga y luego entrar una orden de defecto si usted no  cumple; (b) tratar como lo ha admitido cualquier alegación en la queja a la que usted no respondió al decidir si hay  pruebas  sustanciales  de  una  violación  de  una  ordenanza;  o  (c)  concluir  la  investigación  sin  más  intervención  de  usted.    ¿Cómo presentar su respuesta?  Después de que se presente una queja, la Comisión notifique a cada demandado nombrado por correo.  El envío  incluye una copia de la queja, un plazo para presentar una respuesta por escrito, y la información para ayudarle a  responder.  Usted puede obtener una extensión del plazo para responder si se puede demostrar una buena causa por  el  tiempo  extra.  El  envió  incluye  formularios  e  instrucciones  que  usted  puede  usar  para  enviar  su  respuesta  y  la  documentación de apoyo, o para buscar una extensión de tiempo.  Reglamentos 210.240 y 210.250 (disponible en el  sitio web de la Comisión) explican lo que una respuesta debe contener.    Sobre el proceso de investigación.  La  Comisión  de  Relaciones  Humanas  tiene  la  obligación  de  realizar  una  investigación  de  cada  denuncia  de  discriminación  presentada  por  un  miembro  del  público.    El  propósito  de  la  investigación  es  determinar  si  hay  pruebas sustanciales de una violación de las Ordenanzas de Derechos Humanos o la Equidad de Vivienda.  Si usted  proporciona rápidamente una respuesta junto con pruebas documentales para apoyar su posición, y participa en las  entrevistas  que  solicita  el  investigador,  usted  puede  mejorar  las  posibilidades  de  una  decisión  a  su  favor,  sin  necesidad de una audiencia administrativa.  Pero incluso si la Comisión encuentra pruebas sustanciales, todavía no  es un determinación que usted violó la ordenanza, sino sólo que hay pruebas suficientes para enviar el caso a la  audiencia  administrativa.  El  demandante  todavía  necesita  probar  el  caso  en  la  audiencia  administrativa.    Si  evita  predeterminado  siguiendo  los  procedimientos,  usted  podrá  presentar  sus  defensas  a  la  queja  en  el  proceso  de  la  audiencia administrativa.    Más información sobre la Comisión de Relaciones Humanas y ordenanzas de discriminación de Chicago  está disponible en la segunda página de este folleto y en www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations.        Reglamento de Selección   RESPUESTA A LAS QUEJAS      Reg. 210.210 Requisitos del Aviso de Respuesta    Cuando la Comisión sirve una queja o demanda enmendada, se notificará a cada demandado del procedimiento para  presentar y entregar una respuesta por escrito y las posibles sanciones en caso de falta de respuesta. Si la Comisión  considera  que  una  queja  no  reúne  los  requisitos  jurisdiccionales  o  no  establece  una  demanda  en  la  que  se  podrá  conceder alivio, la Comisión podrá desestimar la queja.    Reg. 210.260 Falta de Respuesta    Si el demandado no presenta o no sirve una respuesta completa a tiempo, la Comisión podrá adoptar una o varias de  las siguientes acciones:     (a) Ordenar al demandado para curar cualquier deficiencia y luego entrar una orden de incumplimiento si el  demandado no cumple.    (b)  consideren  admitido  cualquier  alegación  en  la  queja  que  no  tenga  respuesta,  para  determinar  si  hay  evidencia sustancial de una violación de una ordenanza.    (c)  Proceder    a  determinar  si  existe  evidencia  sustancial  de  una  violación  de  una  ordenanza  sin  mayor  consulta a la parte demandada.     Reg. 210.270 Obligaciones Demandado     (a) Preservación de Registros     Cuando el demandado tiene conocimiento de la queja, el demandado debe preservar todos los registros y cualquier  otro material que pueda ser relevante para el caso hasta que el asunto este cerrado.  Si el demandado destruye o no  mantiene  los  registros  y  otros  materiales  (i)  en  la  espera  de  la  presentación  de  la  demanda,  (ii)  debido  a  la  presentación de la queja o la investigación de la Comisión, o (iii) con la intención de derrotar  los efectos de las  ordenanzas, la Comisión o la audiencia oficial podrá imponer sanciones apropiadas.     (b)  Actualización de la Información de Contacto y Estado     Cuando el demandado tiene conocimiento de una queja, tiene la obligación de mantener informada a la Comisión de  la información de contacto actual y su estado, como sigue:     (1) Cualquier empresa, corporación, organización, u otra entidad sin ánimo, debe informar a la Comisión de  cualquier cambio en el nombre, dirección, y/o número del teléfono de su propio o de su nombrada persona  de contacto.  Además, se debe informar a la Comisión cada vez que el estado de la entidad cambia, como  cuando  vendió....     (2)  Cualquier  demandado  individuo  debe  informar  a  la  Comisión  de  cualquier  cambio  de  dirección  o  número de teléfono.  El representante debe informar a la Comisión cuando un demandado individuo muere  y proporcionar el nombre, dirección y número de teléfono del sucesor de la persona.   bancarrota,   protección   archivos   se   cierra,   si   se   o   para   la   de   Si  el  demandado  no  puede  actualizar  a  la  Comisión  sobre  la  información  de  contacto  y  el  estado,  la  Comisión  enviará  las  órdenes,  avisos  y  otros  documentos  a  la  dirección  más  reciente  que  tenga  la  Comisión y que se considerará suficiente.  El demandado que no actualiza la información de contacto no  puede luego confiar en que no recibió una orden, notificación u otro documento como defensa.

The  ordinance  further  states  that  the  tax  does  not  apply  to  ""bags  provided  by  a  dine-in  or  take-out  restaurant to contain food or drink purchased by the restaurant’s customers.""      The Department will consider a given store location to be a ""restaurant"" if more than 50% of its sales  of  food  and  drink  are  subject  to  the  ""high""  sales  tax  rate  provided  by  Section  2-10  of  the  Illinois  Retailers’  Occupation  Tax  Act,  35  ILCS  120/2-10  which  applies  to  food  prepared  for  immediate  consumption.        If a store has some operations that would qualify as a restaurant if considered separately, but that do  not  qualify  if  considered  together  with  the  store's  other  operations,  then  the  bags  provided  by  the  restaurant  operations  will  still  qualify  as  exempt  so  long  as  the  store  utilizes  a  reliable  means  of  documenting, recording and accounting for receipts that clearly separates its restaurant sales from its  other sales, so that the amount of its tax liability can be correctly determined and confirmed.

It’s Never Too Late To Quit  Quit Once 773-395-9514  Breathing Freedom Smoking Cessation Sinai Urban Institute 773-257-5106  Respiratory Health Association 312-243-2000  The 1982 United States Surgeon General’s report stated that “Cigarette smoking is the major single cause of cancer mortality (death) in the  United States.” This statement is as true today as it was in 1982. About half of all Americans who keep smoking will die because of the habit. Each year about 443,000 people in the United States die from illnesses related to cigarette smoking. Cigarettes kill more Americans than alcohol, car accidents, suicide, AIDS, homicide and illegal drugs combined.  People who stop smoking when they are young get the greatest health benefits from quitting. Those who quit in their 30s may avoid most of the risk due to tobacco use. But even smokers who quit after age 50 largely reduce their risk of dying early. The argument that it is too late to quit smoking because the damage is already done is not true. It is never too late to quit smoking!

In late September, our private contractor will begin the work to install a new sewer in S.  Damen Avenue (100th Street-101st Street), in W. 101st Street (Damen-Bell), in S. Seeley  Avenue (101st Street-101st Place), and in S. Leavitt Street (101st Street-102nd Street). The  old sewer dates back to 1914 and needs to be replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will  be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    19th Ward Office: 773-238-8766    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.     Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Randy Conner  Commissioner of Water Management

Moore’s (49th Ward) request, I am providing you with information  regarding a water construction project in your neighborhood. This is part of our approach to  renewing our city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our  customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,574 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Lunt Avenue, from N.  Ravenswood Avenue to N. Ashland Boulevard. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Moore’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                                      LUNT AVE. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,574 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Lunt Avenue, from N. Ravenswood Avenue to N. Ashland Boulevard.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by mid September 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Lunt Avenue outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.                  CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1   ALDERMAN JOSEPH A. MOORE   773- 338-5796   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid September  2012. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!           Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.     Save Water Save Money!
