Under the current union contracts, which became effective in 2014, an officer no longer has  the option of requesting Police Board review of a suspension of 30 days or fewer (except in  cases in which the union decides to not advance a police officer’s grievance to arbitration).

An evidentiary hearing is then scheduled.     Once a hearing is completed, the members of the Police Board receive and review the entire  record of proceedings in preparation for their monthly meeting. The Board meets in closed  session to consider the case. At the following month’s public meeting, the Board will take  final action on the case and adopt its written findings and decision.     The Board closely monitors the amount of time needed bring disciplinary cases to hearing  and decision. A fair and efficient disposition of each case is an important component of due  process, and keeping delays to a minimum is a priority because the accused officer is  ordinarily suspended without pay when the charges are filed.      The table below shows the median amount of time from the filing of charges to a hearing  and decision.                        Suspension Cases: Six Through Thirty Days   As noted above, under the current union contracts, which became effective in 2014, an  officer no longer has the option of requesting Police Board review of a suspension of 30  days or fewer (except in cases in which the union decides to not advance a police officer’s  grievance to arbitration).

A party dissatisfied with the  Circuit Court’s review of a Police Board case may appeal to the Appellate Court of Illinois.     The first section below provides data on suits in administrative review during the current  year.  The second section provides historical data on appeals filed since January 1, 2010. As  noted above, a particular case may be reviewed at several levels; in addition, court rulings  may cause the Board to issue more than one decision in the same case. The data on court  decisions in the tables below pertain to final court decisions regarding the Board’s original  decision.    Current Year Data  From January 1 through September 30, 2015, 12 Police Board decisions were appealed to  the Circuit Court of Cook County (11 by the Superintendent and 1 by the officer).  In  addition, 2 Circuit Court decisions were appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court (by the  accused officers).     Courts issued final decisions regarding 8 Police Board decisions from January 1 through  September 30, 2015. Of these 8 decisions:       The Circuit Court of Cook County affirmed 7 of the Board’s decisions. None of these      court decisions was appealed.  In 1 case, the Circuit Court reversed the Board’s decision to discharge an officer and  ordered it to impose a penalty less than discharge, and the Superintendent did not  appeal the lesser penalty to the Appellate Court.

On October  10, Board Staff advised you by telephone that the  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  you  from  accepting  the  prize;  this  letter  is  provided  pursuant to your request on October 20 for a written statement in that regard.   ]  [ annual   Alpha's   a manager   ] in  [   certain   industry   ], you promote  [   media.

As  part  of the  event,  a  raffle  was  held  for  three  prizes;  you  won  the  grand  prize,  an  $800  gift  certificate  for  travel booked through [   ], a local travel agency.   Beta  subsidiaries   Gamma   Three  facts  are  of central  importance  in  this  case.  First,  you  did  not accept  the  item  from  an  anonymous  donor,  which  would  have  violated  Section  2-156-040(a) of the  Ordinance;  rather,  the  prize was  publicly sponsored and  donated  by  [  Beta  ] .

Staffs opinion does  not necessarily  dispose  of all  issues  relevant to  this  situation,  but is  based  solely on the application of the  City's Governmental Ethics Ordinance to  the  facts  stated in this  letter.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify us immediately, as any change  may alter our opinion.  Furthermore, we remind you that City departments have the authority to  adopt and enforce rules of conduct that may be more restrictive than the  limitations imposed by  the Ethics Ordinance.

Program Date:  June 1, 2012.  This Booklet describes the benefits under the Group Program as of  the Program Date.   •   This Booklet and the Certificate of Coverage together form your Group Insurance Certificate.   The Coverages in this Booklet are insured under a Group Contract issued by Prudential.  All  benefits are subject in every way to the entire Group Contract which includes the Group  Insurance Certificate.  It alone forms the agreement under which payment of insurance is made.   BASIC EMPLOYEE TERM LIFE COVERAGE  BENEFIT AMOUNTS:   Amount For Each Benefit Class:   Benefit Classes   All Employees   Amount of Insurance   $75,000   Effect of Option to Accelerate Payment of Death Benefits:  Your amount of insurance (as  determined in the absence of this provision) will be reduced by the amount of any Terminal Illness  Proceeds paid under the Option to Accelerate Payment of Death Benefits.   OPTIONAL EMPLOYEE TERM LIFE COVERAGE  You may enroll for one of the options below.  The option for which you enroll will be recorded by  Prudential.   BENEFIT AMOUNTS:   Amount For Each Benefit Class:   Benefit Classes   Amount of Insurance   All Eligible Employees      Option 1   Option 2   Option 3   Option 4   Option 5   Option 6   83500  BSB 1001     100% of your annual Earnings.*   200% of your annual Earnings.*   300% of your annual Earnings.*   400% of your annual Earnings.*   500% of your annual Earnings.*   600% of your annual Earnings.*     4   (44004-31)      Option 7   Option 8   Option 9   Option 10   700% of your annual Earnings.*   800% of your annual Earnings.*   900% of your annual Earnings.*   1000% of your annual Earnings.*   *If annual Earnings is not a multiple of $1,000, annual Earnings will be rounded to the next higher  multiple of $1,000 then multiplied by the increment selected.      Maximum Amount of Optional Employee Term Life  Coverage: $1,500,000.   The Definitions section explains what “Earnings"" means.   Non-medical Limit on Amount of Insurance:  There is a limit on the amount for which you may be  insured without submitting evidence of insurability.  This is called the Non-medical Limit.   If the amount of insurance for your Class at any time is more than the Non-medical Limit, you must  give evidence of insurability satisfactory to Prudential before the part over the Limit can become  effective.   This requirement applies:  when you first become insured; when your Class changes; if you request  an increase in your Amount of Insurance; or if the amount for your Class is changed by an  amendment to the Group Contract.  Even if you are insured for an amount over the Limit, you will still  have to meet this evidence requirement before any increase in your amount of insurance can become  effective.  The amount of your insurance will be increased to the amount for your Class when  Prudential decides the evidence is satisfactory and you meet the Active Work Requirement.   Non-medical Limit:  The lesser of (1) 300% of your annual Earnings and (2) $1,000,000.   The Delay of Effective Date section does not apply to this provision.   Increases and Decreases:  You may elect to have your amount of insurance under the Coverage  changed within 31 days of a Life Event.  You must do this on a form approved by Prudential and  agree to make any required contributions.   If you request an increase of more than three options, you must give evidence of insurability.  The  amount of your insurance will be increased when Prudential decides the evidence is satisfactory and  you meet the Active Work Requirement.   If you request a lower amount of insurance, that lower amount will become effective on the first of the  month following the month in which the change was requested.   The “Definitions” section explains what “Life Event” means.   Optional Term Life Coverage amounts for which you were insured providing Optional Employee Term  Life Coverage for Employees of the Employer on the day prior to the Program Date will remain in  force.   Effect of Option to Accelerate Payment of Death Benefits:  Your amount of insurance (as  determined in the absence of this provision) will be reduced by the amount of any Terminal Illness  Proceeds paid under the Option to Accelerate Payment of Death Benefits.   83500  BSB 1001       5   (44004-31)      Right to Elect Dependents Term Life  Coverage under the Portability Plan   This right applies to the Optional Dependents Term Life Coverage under the Group Contract.   It describes when and how your Qualified Dependents may become covered for similar coverage  under the Portability Plan when your Optional Dependents Term Life Coverage under the Group  Contract ends.  The terms and conditions of the Portability Plan will not be the same as those under  this Group Contract.  The amount of insurance available under the Portability Plan may not be the  same as the amount under this Group Contract.   RIGHT TO APPLY FOR COVERAGE UNDER THE PORTABILITY PLAN  A right under this section is subject to the rest of these provisions.   You will have the right to apply for dependents term life coverage under the Portability Plan for a  Qualified Dependent if all of these tests are met:   (1)  The Optional Dependents Term Life Coverage on the dependent ends because your Optional   Employee Term Life Coverage ends for any reason other than:   (a)  your failure to pay, when due, any contribution required for it; or   (b)   the end of the Optional Employee Term Life Coverage for all Employees when such  Coverage is replaced by group life insurance from any carrier for which you are or become  eligible within the next 31 days.   (2)  You apply and become covered for term life coverage under the Portability Plan.   (3)  With respect to a dependent spouse, Civil Union Partner or Domestic Partner, that spouse, Civil   Union Partner or Domestic Partner is less than age 80.   (4)  With respect to a dependent child, that child is:   (a)   less than age 19; or   (b)   less than age 23, enrolled as a full-time student in a school, and wholly depends on you for  support and maintenance.   (5)  The dependent is covered for Optional Dependents Term Life Coverage on the day your   Optional Employee Term Life Coverage ends.   (6)  The dependent is not confined for medical care or treatment, at home or elsewhere on the day   your Optional Employee Term Life Coverage ends.   If you die, your spouse, Civil Union Partner or Domestic Partner will have the right to apply for term  life coverage under the Portability Plan if that spouse, Civil Union Partner or Domestic Partner meets  all of the tests in (3), (5) and (6) above.   83500  PORT 1006       22   (44004-31)   "

In your letter, you state that [Michael             ], as [manager                                                                   ], would  be responsible for the administrative  operations  of  the  [department].  You  further  state  that  “[Michael]  will  not  have  any  responsibility  or  authority  in  approving  any personnel  or  payroll  actions,  including  Missed  Punch  Reports,  Vacations, Administrative  Leave,  Salary  Increases  and  Disciplinary  Hearings  for  any employee he may be related to by blood relation or marriage.”  After  careful  consideration  of  the  information  that  you  submitted  and  the relevant  law,  the  Board  concludes  that,  although  the  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit the appointment or promotion of [Michael]   or any other City employee to any position,  Section 2-156-130 (Employment of Relatives)  of  the  Ethics  Ordinance  does  impose  certain  restrictions  on  the conduct of City employees, including [Michael                    ], with regard to the employment and supervision of relatives.  The Board advises the [department] and  [Michael]  to  be  mindful,  in  the  exercise  of  his  City  duties  and responsibilities as [manager                                ], of these restrictions, which are discussed in detail below.     APPLICABLE LAW AND ANALYSIS:  Section  2-156-130(a).    The  provision  of  the  Ethics  Ordinance  that  is  most relevant to your request is Section 2-156-130(a) which provides, in pertinent part:  No  official  or  employee  shall  employ  or  advocate  for employment, in any City agency in which said official serves or  over  which  he  exercises  authority,  supervision,  or control, any person (i) who is a relative of said official or employee . . . . (emphasis added.)  Case No. 01022.A May 23, 2001 Page 2  Section 2-156-010(w) of the Ethics Ordinance defines “relative” as:  . . . a person who is related to an official or employee as spouse or as any of the following, whether by blood or by adoption: parent, child, brother or sister, aunt or uncle, niece or nephew, grandparent, grandchild, father-in-law, mother- in-law,  son-in-law,  daughter-in-law,  stepfather  or  stepmother,  stepson  or stepdaughter, stepbrother or stepsister, half-brother or half-sister.  In past cases, the Board has determined that the term “employ” refers not only to the act of hiring, but also to the “ongoing supervision” of any employee by a relative.  See Case No. 91088.I; Case No. 89094.A.  “Ongoing supervision” includes a broader range of employment issues, including employee evaluations, promotions, and salary increases.  Case No. 91088.I, p. 5; see also Case No. 89094.A,  p. 3.    In  Case  No. 91088.I, the Board found that an employee who signed  promotion documents and salary increase forms with respect to his brother exercised supervisory responsibility over the brother, in violation of Section 2-156-130(a) of the Ethics Ordinance.  A violation was found in that case even though:  a) the employee was not the brother’s immediate supervisor (three supervisory levels existed between the employee and his brother); and b) the employee had no direct involvement in the actual selection of candidates to be promoted or in the recommendation for salary increases.  Rather, the employee simply signed the promotion documents and salary increase forms as required by the administrative policies for his position in the department.  Furthermore, in Case No. 97054.A, the Board concluded that a violation of Section 2-156-130(a) of the Ethics Ordinance occurred where a father signed missed punch reports and vacation approval forms with respect to his two sons.   The Board cases cited above illustrate the type of activities that are prohibited under Section 2-156- 130(a) of the Ethics Ordinance.  While the Board has actually found violations where one employee has made, taken part in, approved or attempted to influence employee performance evaluations, promotions, salary increases, employee attendance and vacations, with respect to a relative, these activities are not the only ones that may trigger a violation under Section 2-156-130(a) of the Ethics Ordinance.  The Board has found that the purpose of Section 2-156-130(a) of the Ethics Ordinance is to prohibit favoritism of all kinds towards relatives, not only in hiring decisions, but in a broader range of employment issues.  Case No. 91088.I, p. 5; see also Case No. 89094.A, p. 3.  In this case, you state that [Michael       ], as [manager                        ], will not have any responsibility or authority in approving any personnel or payroll actions, including Missed Punch Reports,  Vacations,  Administrative  Leave,  Salary  Increases  and  Disciplinary  Hearings  for  any employee he may be related to by blood relation or marriage.  While the activities that you set forth are certainly included in the type of activities that are prohibited under Section 2-156-130(a), they are not all-inclusive.  In the Board’s advisory opinion of January 14, 1998 (Case No. 97054.A), which you reference in your letter,  the Board found that Section 2-156-130(a) prohibits all actions or activities, by City employees, involving the hiring or ongoing supervision of a relative of such  Case No. 01022.A May 23, 2001 Page 3  employee.  Therefore, we conclude that, under Section 2-156-130(a) and in accordance with the Board’s opinions in past cases, [Michael    ] is prohibited not only from engaging in the activities that you list in your letter, but he is also prohibited from taking part in or influencing any other actions or decisions related to the hiring or supervision of a relative, including the advocacy for employment of a relative in the [department].    Sections 2-156-130(b) and (c).  As [manager                        ], [Michael                 ] may well have or exercise “contract management authority” over various “persons.”  Because Section 2-156-130 of the Ethics Ordinance also extends to a City employee’s responsibilities with respect to outside contractors, we want to advise you and [Michael    ] of additional provisions that may be relevant to  your  request.    Sections  2-156-130(b)  and  (c)  of  the  Ethics  Ordinance  impose  the  following restrictions on the conduct of City employees vested with contract management authority:      (b) No official or employee shall exercise contract management authority where any relative of the official or employee is employed by or has contracts with persons  doing  City  work  over  which  the  City  official  or  employee  has  or exercises contract management authority; and   (c) No official or employee shall use or permit the use of his position to assist any relative  in  securing  employment  or  contracts  with  persons  over  whom  the employee or official exercises contract management authority. The employment of or contracting with a relative of such a City official or employee by such a person within six months prior to, during the term of, or six months subsequent to  the  period  of  a  City  contract  shall  be  evidence  that  said  employment  or contract was  obtained in violation of this chapter.  Also,  Section  2-156-010  of  the  Ethics  Ordinance,  Definitions,  provides,  the  following definitions:  (g) “Contract management authority” means personal involvement in or direct supervisory responsibility for the formulation or execution of a City contract, including without limitation the preparation of specifications, evaluation of bids or proposals, negotiation of contract terms or supervision of performance.  (r)  “Person”  means  any  individual,  entity,  corporation,  partnership,  firm, association, union, trust, estate, as well as any parent or subsidiary of any of the foregoing, whether or not operated for profit.  Therefore, under Section 2-156-130(b), [Michael], as a City employee, is prohibited from exercising contract management authority (as defined above) over City work if the person doing that work either employs or contracts with a  relative of [Michael ].  Under 2-156-130(c), [Michael      ] is also prohibited from using his City position to help a relative in gaining  Case No. 01022.A May 23, 2001 Page 4  employment or contracts with persons over whom he exercises contract management authority. Further, if a relative of [Michael      ] were to become employed by, or contract with, a person over whom he exercises contract management authority either during the pendency of the person’s City contract or six months before or after the contract's term, that would be evidence that [Michael      ] used his position to assist a relative, in violation of Section 2-156-130(c). (See Case No. 95027.A, pp. 3 and 4.)  DETERMINATION:  The  Board  determines  that,  although  the  Governmental  Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit the appointment or promotion of [Michael               ] or any other City employee to any position, it does impose certain restrictions on the conduct of City employees, including [Michael               ], with regard to the employment and supervision of relatives.  The Board advises the [department             ] and [Michael      ] to be mindful, in the exercise of his City duties and responsibilities, of these restrictions.   Our determination is not necessarily dispositive of all issues relevant to this situation, but is based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify the Board immediately, as any change may alter our determination.  Other laws or rules also may apply to this situation.  Be advised that City departments have the authority to adopt and enforce rules of conduct that may be more restrictive than the limitations imposed by the Ethics Ordinance.  Please be advised that, pursuant to Rule 3-8 of the Board’s Rules and Regulations, a copy of this advisory opinion is being forwarded to the subject of this opinion, [Michael            ].   RELIANCE: This opinion may be relied upon by (1) any person involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which this opinion is rendered and (2) any person involved in any specific transaction or activity indistinguishable in all its material aspects from the transaction or activity with respect to which the opinion is rendered.

The heavy rains experienced resulted in sewer overflows, basement floods, and backflow of water from the Chicago River into Lake Michigan. The excessive rainfall that entered the sewer system could not flow fast enough to a wastewater treatment plant or a combined sewer outfall. By early morning of April 18, before the largest rainfall, the Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP) tunnels, also known as the deep tunnels, were filled, which resulted in combined sewer overflows at 132 separate outfall locations. To prevent overland flooding the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) and the Army Corp of Engineers opened the Chicago River controlling locks for nearly 23 hours, leading to a discharge of over 10.7 billion gallons into Lake Michigan. However, the April storms produced such heavy rains that the combined sewers overflowed and released untreated waste and stormwater. As sewer water rose above drain openings that were below street grade, water backed up into homes and other buildings. Basement flooding occurred citywide, with the City receiving over 2,500 water-in-basement calls and over 800 water-in-streets calls from residents from all 50 wards.   The flooding also significantly impacted Chicago's infrastructure and resulted in the City receiving 571 calls of flooded streets and 32 calls of flooded viaducts. The Department of Streets and Sanitation relocated 105 vehicles to remove them from flooded areas. The Chicago Transit Authority received calls regarding flooded train stations.  The rain and related flooding caused major road closures, including the following interstate highways and major city thoroughfares: I-94 northbound at the Kennedy Junction; I-94 southbound at Dempster Avenue; I-94 northbound between Foster and Touhy; I-94 northbound at 130th Street; Bishop Ford Expressway experienced major backups with lanes closures; 96thand Dorchester due to a sinkhole; Midway Plaisance eastbound; Belmont Avenue ramp to northbound Lake Shore Drive; Viaducts on Stoney Island, 95th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue.  Recovery Needs:  To aid in recovery efforts of community areas that were most impacted by the storms, the City has committed the majority of CDBG-DR funding toward public way infrastructure restoration, specifically to the water, sewer and drainage system which will bring these areas to resilience.  These funds will specifically address infrastructure limitations and underlying conditions that contribute to the flooding of residences. The City committed the remainder to provide direct assistance to housing rehabilitation for homeowners and renters, as well as  1  Community Development Systems Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)  mitigation measures.  This initiative will prioritize residents with FEMA-verified loss and documented unmet needs who are low- and moderate- income residents.

Municipal Code 7-12-140 requires all dogs four months and older be registered with the City of   Chicago.    It helps us locate your lost dog. The person who finds your dog simply calls our office at 312-744-DOGS with   your registration number (on your dog’s tag).    Dogs must be registered in order to stay at dog boarding and daycare service facilities.   Dog registration is a prerequisite for acquiring permission to enter Chicago Park District dog-friendly areas.   Dogs must have a current rabies vaccination. Get your dog vaccinated at any Chicago area veterinarian clinic or  other licensed provider.     Your dog’s registration expires on either the registration expiration date (i.e. 1 or 3 years after purchase,  depending on the length you purchase) or the expiration date of its current rabies vaccination, whichever comes  first. Since rabies vaccinations typically last either one or three years (depending on the vaccination administered  by your dog’s vet), the clerk’s office offers dog registration in 1-year and 3 year increments.
