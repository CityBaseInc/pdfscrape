This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 5,678 feet of 12-inch water main in N. Cicero Avenue, from  W. Chicago Avenue to W. Madison Street. The old pipe dates back to 1897, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Ervin’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Jason C.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:         ELVA ZONA HEASTER      •  Elva Zona Heaster was found dead in Greenbrier County, West Virginia.  The resulting  murder trial of her husband was perhaps the only case in United States history where the  testimony of a ghost helped secure a conviction.   •  Grant’s Tomb was dedicated.  •  The Klondike Gold Rush began when the first successful prospectors arrived in Seattle.  •  The Boston subway opened, becoming the first underground metro in North America.  •  Dracula, a novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, was published.  •  The play Cyrano de Bergerac, by Edmund Rostand, premiered in Paris, France.                            CICERO AVE. WATER PROJECT         PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 5,678 feet of 12-inch  water main in N. Cicero Avenue, from W. Chicago Avenue to W. Madison Street.    Reason: The old main consist of 8-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1897 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main job to  be completed in early February 2015. This project is being coordinated with CDOT and their  department will complete all final restoration in mid April 2015. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Cicero Avenue outside of our working hours.  When  we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always  be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside  of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ALDERMAN JASON C. ERVIN   773-533-0900   http://www.AldermanErvin.com/   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                                               FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  .    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in early  February 2015. This project is being coordinated with CDOT and their department will complete  all final restoration in mid April 2015. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are  at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

6667`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/lac/supp_info/2009lacrulings/08LA42.pdf`Success`Success`11`10`Not a fillable PDF.`On June 6, 2008, Kaleo, Inc. submitted a Plan of Operation. Some of the relevant   provisions of this plan of operation were having a last seating on the patio at 8:30 p.m. and   closing of the patio and the french doors on the front of the premises at 10:00 p.m.       On July 1, 2008, Ms. Eisenhauer sent the applicant a letter disapproving the Plan of   Operation in relevant part on the basis that its proposals did not reasonably alleviate concerns of   excess noise from the neighborhood residents concerning an outdoor patio and only dealt with   abatement of noise from the inside of the premises.       The applicant filed a timely notice of appeal at the License Appeal Commission on July   18, 2008.  This matter proceeded to hearing on October 1, 2008 and November 20, 2008.       Joy Adelizzi is the Deputy Director with the Department of Business Affairs and   Licensing and testified on behalf of the Local Liquor Control Commission.  She testified that the   Local Liquor Control Commission initially denied the application for an outdoor patio license on   May 19, 2008, for deleterious impact based on objections from residents and community groups.    A Plan of Operation submitted by the applicant was reviewed and it was determined by the   Local Liquor Control Commission that it did not adequately address the noise stemming from   the outdoor patio.  Ms. Adelizzi stated noise was the main concern in terms of deleterious   impact.  Ms. Adelizzi also testified a basis for the denial of the Plan of Operation was an   objection from the President of the Armitage Park Homeowners Association that it did not agree   to a 10:00 p.m. closing for the patio and such was not represented at a meeting with the                       2   Bucktown Community Organization.  The Armitage Park Homeowners Association also   indicated its opposition was also based on the fact it was disappointed the applicant was seeking   this license since they had proposed not to seek this license when the original incidental activity   was issued.       On cross, Ms. Adelizzi acknowledged there is nothing in the file from the police   department documenting complaints by neighbors with respect to noise or with respect to any   issue.  She was not at the meeting of the Bucktown Community Organization and had no   personal knowledge if members of the Armitage Park Homeowners Association were present.    She also admitted that between the buildings of the Armitage Park Homeowners Association and   the proposed area for the outdoor patio is the building in which Cleo=s Restaurant is located.       Carl Manthe testified that he has been the President of the Armitage Park Homeowners   Association for three years.  He and his wife Penelope Hopper live at 2052 W. Armitage.  The   Association consists of two buildings of six town homes.  Each home is four stories and has a   rooftop deck.  He testified individually and in his official capacity of the Association.  Six units,   including his unit, are directly across an alley from Cleo=s.  They are to the west of Cleo=s.  To   the immediate east of Cleo=s is an empty space where the outdoor patio would be located and   then further east is a three flat building.  He can see Cleo=s and the three flat building from his   unit and he can see the empty garden area from his rooftop.  The view of Cleo=s from some of the   units is obstructed but Cleo=s can be heard everywhere.  At the time of the hearing one of the   units adjacent to Cleo=s had a newborn and the room for that newborn is directly on the alley                       3   looking at Cleo=s.  Cleo=s opened about the time he moved into his home.  There are no outdoor   patios in the area.        The witness testified that since Cleo=s opened there has been instances of people   urinating in the alley, knocking over garbage cans and vomiting on the sidewalk.  The other day   he shoved a person who was smoking marijuana away from the alley and that person entered   Cleo=s.  His opinion is that allowing a beer garden would decrease the value of his home.  He   would not have bought his unit if Cleo=s had an outdoor patio.       Cleo=s has a garage door in the front that opens directly into the sidewalk.  There is   another garage door on the side of Cleo=s that opens out onto the proposed site of the patio area.    These doors are open on warm days if it is not raining.  He currently can hear noise from Cleo=s   if these garage doors are open and this happens on any warm day.       Mr. Manthe stated he is opposed to the issuance of this patio license.  One reason for this   opposition was that they had agreed to allow Cleo=s to open with a liquor license if it was   conditioned that they not have an outdoor patio license.  Nine of the twelve unit owners have   signed a petition in opposition to the patio license.  He has never spoken to anyone from Cleo=s   about this patio application.       On cross-examination Mr. Manthe stated his conversations about not objecting to the   original license with the condition that there be no outdoor patio were with the liquor board and                       4   the Alderman at that time.  There were no such conversations with representatives of Cleo=s.    The incident with the person smoking marijuana was a week before his testimony and the   urinating and vomiting happened on numerous times.  He has never called the police because he   did not think it was worthwhile.       Mr. Manthe identified Applicant=s Exhibit #2 as a document dated March 27, 2008, that   he sent to the Liquor Control Commission in his capacity of President of the Armitage Park   Homeowners Association.  In that letter, Mr. Manthe wrote that there were several babies living   in units adjacent to Cleo=s.  When questioned about how this letter seemed to contradict his   testimony at the hearing, Mr. Manthe stated on March 27, 2008, there may have been only one   child currently using the bedroom unit, but all units have a second bedroom that can be used as a   baby=s room.  Mr. Manthe denied trying to mislead the Local Liquor Control Commission.       It should be noted that the denial of the Plan of Operation was based in part on a   conversation with Mr. Manthe in which he stated the Association opposed the issuance of this   license Adue to the close proximity of bedroom windows on both sides of the applicant=s   business.@  Mr. Manthe also stated to the Department of Business Affairs and Licensing/Local   Liquor Control Commission that A...many of these are children=s bedrooms for infants and   toddlers who go to sleep well before 10:00 p.m.@       Debra Dodge lives one block north of Cleo=s.  There is an alley, a house, McLean Street   and then her home.  She cannot see Cleo=s from her home but can hear noise from the backyard                       5   of the home across the street when they have parties.  Since Cleo=s has opened there is a lot more   traffic and a lot of poor people walking in the alley.  She never had problems before Cleo=s but   last year her home was broken into.  She is a member of the Bucktown Community   Organization=s Zoning Committee and was present when Cleo=s made a presentation in the   Spring of 2008.  No vote was taken in the proposal.  She opposes the issuance of this outdoor   patio license.       Benjamin Leo lives at 2052 W. Armitage and is a member of the Armitage Park   Homeowners Association.  He opposes the issuance of a patio license to Cleo=s because it will   increase noise in the immediate area.  He currently hears noise from Cleo=s when it is warm   outside because those big garage doors are open.  There will be additional problems outside   Cleo=s from people loitering.  Since Cleo=s opened he has heard and seen guys knock all the   garbage cans down on three occasions.  He also witnessed what appeared to be a drug sale in that   alley in June of 2008.       Penelope Hopper is the wife of Carl Manthe the President of the Armitage Park   Homeowners Association.  She was surprised to learn Cleo=s has applied for an outdoor patio   license because they had not opposed the liquor license if it did not pursue an outdoor liquor   license.  She feels an outdoor beer garden is not in character with the neighborhood.  If and when   they have a child, the baby=s room will be facing Cleo=s.  They already hear noise from Cleo=s   when the doors are open. She and Carl would not have bought their unit if they knew Cleo=s was   to have an outdoor patio.  They hear noise from Cleo=s when inside their unit and when using the                       6   rooftop deck.    A summary of the testimony in the applicant=s case is also relevant to this decision.       Alderman Flores of the 1st Ward testified he has known Joseph Sabath as the licensee of a   Cleo=s located at 1935 W. Chicago Avenue for many years.  He has had no problems with the   operation of that Cleo=s.       Joseph Sabath testified he is the President of Kaleo, Inc., which does business as Cleo=s at   2048 W. Armitage.  He has been in business at this location for two years and the premises has a   Restaurant - Incidental Activity License.  He also has operated a Cleo=s at 1935 W. Chicago   Avenue for several years with no violations.  He is a member of East Village Association and the   West Town Chamber of Commerce.  He has sponsored West Fest and sport teams.  His plan for   the vacant lot is an intimate setting with twelve tables and seating for 40 to 48 people.  The last   seating on the patio would be at 8:30 p.m. and the doors would close at 10:00 p.m.       Laurie Sabath is the wife of Joseph Sabath.  She has been a Certified Real Estate   Appraiser for five years and has done about 3000 appraisals.  She is familiar with the   townhouses adjacent to Cleo=s and has been in several units. She testified to the views or lack of   views from different townhouses.  She also noted noise emanating from the air conditioning   units.            The first issue before this Commission is whether the issuance of this specific outdoor                  7   patio license at this location will cause a deleterious impact on the health, safety and welfare of   the surrounding community.  Deleterious impact is defined as Aan adverse effect on the value of   property, an increased risk of violation of law or a risk of a substantial increase in noise, litter or   vehicular congestion.@  If a deleterious impact is proved by substantial evidence at this de novo   hearing this Commission must then determine if the proposed Plan of Operation adequately   addresses the deleterious impact issue.        Since the original denial letter alleges the issuance of this license would cause a law   enforcement problem that issue will be addressed first.  There was testimony that there has been   an increase in crime in the area after the opening of Cleo=s. There was also testimony of loitering   in the alley, tipping of garbage cans and of a possible drug transaction.  There was no testimony   that the issuance of this outdoor patio license would cause a law enforcement problem for the   district police.  There was no evidence that the District Commander objected to this license. The   City did not prove the issuance of this license would cause a law enforcement problem.       Ms. Adelizzi testified the noise element was the major concern of the Department of   Business Affairs and Licensing/Local Liquor Control Commission.  The testimony at this    de novo hearing is that there is noise emanating from the open garage doors at Cleo=s that can   already be heard by the neighbors in the adjacent townhouse.  This noise is heard on warm days   when the doors are open.  The doors can now be open until closing.  While there will be noise   now emanating from the area of where the outdoor patio would be located, that fact alone is   insufficient to establish a risk of a substantial increase in noise.  It should also be noted there was                       8   no evidence of noise complaints against Cleo=s.       A close review of the testimony in opposition to the license shows that a major, if not the   major reason for opposing this license is the opinion that they were misled by Cleo=s.  They feel   Cleo=s promised to not open an outdoor patio in exchange for their support of the original   incidental activity license.  This is not a relevant factor to the issues of this case.       Since the City has failed to prove the issuance of this outdoor patio license this   Commission need not address the Plan of Operation.       Based on the specific evidence presented in this case and this Commissioner=s finding   that the testimony of Carl Manthe was not credible the decision of the Department of Business   Affairs and Licensing/Local Liquor Control Commission denying the issuance of an outdoor   patio license to Kaleo, Inc. for the premises located at 2048 W. Armitage is reversed.       COMMISSIONER KOPPEL=S CONCURRING OPINION    Having reviewed the evidence in this case this Commissioner concurs with the   Chairman=s opinion.  The license should be granted.                                    9                              11

11281`https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dcd/supp_info/PCT/AffordableHousingNotificationOrd.pdf`Success`Success`8`8`Not a fillable PDF.`O R D I N A N C E  BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO:  WHEREAS, It is the policy of the City of Chicago to preserve and retain, as a long-term  city resource, privately-owned, federally assisted affordable rental housing units for senior citizens and other low- and moderate-income persons and households; and  WHEREAS, Over the past few years, more than 100,000 such units have been lost from  our Nation’s privately-owned, federally assisted affordable housing stock; and  WHEREAS, Historically, affordable rental housing in the United States was supported by federally subsidized mortgages, project-based rental assistance contracts and use restriction controls. In recent years, however, inadequate funding of the federal affordable housing preservation program, coupled with the restoration in 1996 of prepayment and owner’s choice options that enabled building owners to opt out of these programs with relative ease, by prepaying their federally assisted mortgage, or by terminating their federal mortgage insurance, or through non-renewal of their federal subsidy, has significantly reduced the availability of  high-quality, affordable rental housing units nationwide and throughout our City; and   WHEREAS, The potential loss of affordable rental housing units puts many of our  City’s most vulnerable citizens, particularly the elderly and low-income families, who cannot afford to pay market-priced rents, at risk of displacement; and    WHEREAS, It is more cost efficient to preserve existing affordable rental housing than  to build new affordable rental housing; and         WHEREAS, Under these circumstances, local initiatives to maintain the availability of existing affordable rental housing, while simultaneously protecting the rights of building owners and tenants, have become more critical than ever; and   WHEREAS, One way to stem the tide in Chicago of the sale of privately-owned,  federally assisted rental housing developments at risk for conversion to market rate is to require the owners of these developments to notify the City of Chicago’s Department of Housing (“DOH”) in advance of the owner’s intent to prepay, terminate, sell or otherwise dispose of the development so that DOH can work with the development’s tenants and interested not-for-profit organizations to enable the tenants to avail themselves of their legal rights under Illinois’ Federally Assisted Housing Preservation Act (“the Act”); to give qualified developers, who are interested in maintaining the long-term affordability of an assisted housing development, a “right of first refusal” in the event that tenants fail to avail themselves of the protections provided by the Act; to authorize DOH to establish and maintain a list of qualified developers; to authorize DOH to make all of this information available to any owner, tenant association, qualified entity, not-for-profit organization or other person interested in preserving affordable housing in Chicago; and to give tenants and tenant associations a private right of action to enforce this  section; now, therefore,  BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO:  SECTION 1.  Chapter 2-44 of the Municipal Code of the City of Chicago is hereby  amended by inserting a new section 2-44-111, as follows:  2-44-111 Federally assisted housing preservation.  (A) Title. This section shall be referred to as the Affordable Housing Preservation  Ordinance.  (B) Definitions. As used in this section: “Affordability preservation agreement” means an agreement between the owner and a  purchaser (i) in which the purchaser agrees to maintain the development in a manner that preserves the development’s existing affordability restrictions, or (ii) that would qualify the development as affordable housing as defined in the Illinois Affordable Housing Act, and (iii) in which the affordability restrictions set forth in the agreement are memorialized in covenants running with the land, in a form approved by the commissioner, enforceable by the city as a third party beneficiary.  The affordability restrictions in each affordability preservation agreement shall extend for a period of not less than ten (10) years from the sale or disposition, subject to such exceptions as the commissioner may provide for by rule or regulation issued hereunder.    “Affordability restrictions” means limits on rents that owners may charge for occupancy of a rental unit in assisted housing and limits on tenant income for persons or families seeking to qualify as tenants in assisted housing.  “Assisted housing” or “assisted housing development” or “development” means a rental  housing development, or a mixed use development that includes rental housing, that receives government assistance under any of the following programs:  (1)  New construction, substantial rehabilitation, moderate rehabilitation, property disposition and loan management set-aside programs, or any other program providing project-based rental assistance, under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended; The Below-Market-Interest-Rate Program under Section 221(d)(3) of the National Housing Act; Section 236 of the National Housing Act; Section 202 of the National Housing Act; Programs for rent supplement assistance under Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended; Programs under Section 514 or 515 of the Housing Act of 1949; Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.  (6)  (7) “Bona fide offer” means an offer evidenced by a purchase contract reflecting a sales price  (2)  (3)  (4)  (5)   and an earnest money deposit equal to at least 5% of the sales price identified in the purchase contract.  “Commissioner” means the commissioner of housing.  2  “Department” means the department of housing. “Federally Assisted Housing Preservation Act” or “Act” or “State Act” means the   Federally Assisted Housing Preservation Act, codified at 310 ILCS 60/1, et seq., as amended.  “HUD” means the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. “Just cause eviction” means any eviction for serious or repeated violations of the terms and conditions of a lease or occupancy agreement, or for violation of applicable federal, state or local laws or for other good cause.  “Non-qualified entity” means any person or entity that is not a qualified entity. “Owner(s)” means the person, partnership, corporation, limited liability company or  other legal entity that holds title to an assisted housing development.  “Prepay” or “prepay the mortgage” or “prepayment” means the payment in full or  refinancing of the federally insured or federally held mortgage indebtedness prior to its original maturity date, or the voluntary cancellation of mortgage insurance, on an assisted housing development described in paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of the definition of “assisted housing” set forth in this subsection, that would have the effect of removing the affordability restrictions applicable to the assisted housing development under the programs described in paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of the definition of “assisted housing” set forth in this subsection.    “Qualified entity” means any person or entity deemed to be a qualified entity by the  commissioner pursuant to subsection (I) of this section.  “Substantial deviation” means any substitution of parties to a contingent sales agreement;  any change in sales price of greater than 2 percent; any change in the terms of any owner financing; any change in the allocation of escrow or other fees or costs amongst the parties to the agreement; or any other substantive change to the terms of sale that alters the relative financial position of the parties to the agreement.  (2)  “Terminate” or “terminate participation in the federal program” or “termination” means: (1)  the expiration or early termination of an assisted housing development’s participation in a federal subsidy program for assisted housing described in paragraph (1) of the definition of “assisted housing” set forth in this subsection; or the expiration or early termination of an assisted housing development’s affordability restrictions described in Section 42(g) of the Internal Revenue Code for assisted housing described in paragraph (7) of the definition of “assisted housing” set forth in this subsection, when that event results in an increase in tenant rents, a change in the form of subsidy from project-based to tenant-based, or a change in the use of the assisted housing development to a use other than rental housing.  (C) Notification to department–Required when. If the owner of an assisted housing  development intends to prepay the mortgage, or to terminate participation in the federal program or to sell or otherwise dispose of an assisted housing development, such owner shall so notify the department.  Such notification shall be given to the department on the same date that the owner provides or is required to provide such notification to all tenants of the development under the Federally Assisted Housing Preservation Act.  Provided, however, that if an owner is not  3  required under Section 8 of the Act to provide notice to tenants of the owner’s intent to prepay the mortgage, terminate participation in the federal program or sell or otherwise dispose of the development, the owner shall provide notice to the department in accordance with the requirements of subsection (F) of this section, unless the requirements of subsection (G) apply .   The notice required by this subsection shall be delivered in person or mailed to the  commissioner by certified mail, return receipt requested, on a form provided by the department, and shall contain the following information: (1) the name, address and telephone number of each owner of the development; (2) the address of the development; (3) the nature of the subsidy maintaining the affordability of the development; (4) whether the owner is exempt under Section 8 of the Federally Assisted Housing Preservation Act from providing a notice of intent to tenants, and if exempt, the basis for the exemption; (5) a description of the development, including the number of units comprising the development and the number of bedrooms within each unit; (6) the date on which the owner intends to prepay, terminate, sell or otherwise dispose of the development; (7) a complete and detailed list of all existing affordability restrictions applicable to the development and the units to which these restrictions apply; (8) the development’s current rent roll, including each unit number and the monthly rent charged for each unit; (9) the number and location of vacant units in the development; (10) a statement of the development’s vacancy rate during the preceding 12 months; (11) a statement of the development’s current income and operating expenses; (12) itemized lists of the development’s capital expenditures in each of the two preceding calendar years; (13) the amount of project reserves; (14) copies of all financial and physical inspection reports filed with federal, State or local agencies; (15) if the owner intends to sell or otherwise dispose of the development, the owner’s asking price for the development; (16) a complete and detailed list of all affordability restrictions, if any, applicable to the planned disposition of the development; and (17) any other information that the commissioner may require.      (D) Unlawful act–Exceptions. If, after an owner notifies or is required to notify under the Federally Assisted Housing Preservation Act the tenants of an assisted housing development of the owner’s intent to prepay the mortgage, or to terminate participation in the federal program or to sell or otherwise dispose of the development, the tenants of such development (1) do not exercise their right under the Act to form a tenant association, or (2) fail to provide notice to the owner pursuant to Sections 4 or 6 of the Act, or (3) fail to meet any of the requirements of Section 7 of the Act, then it shall be unlawful for the owner to sell or otherwise dispose of the development to any entity except in conformity with the requirements of subsection (E) of this section. Provided, however, that this prohibition on the sale or disposal of the development to a non-qualified entity shall not apply if the owner enters into an affordability preservation agreement, as defined in subsection (B) of this section, with a non-qualified entity.  (E) Contingent sales agreement–Right of first refusal–Required when. An owner may  negotiate with any non-qualified entity that is interested in purchasing an assisted housing development. Provided, however, that any agreement of sale executed between the owner and such non-qualified entity shall be contingent upon the right of first refusal of a qualified entity, unless the owner enters into an affordability preservation agreement, as defined in subsection (B)  4  of this section, with a non-qualified entity.  The contingent sales agreement required by this subsection shall contain the essential  terms of the sale, including, at a minimum, the right of first refusal of a qualified entity; the sales price; the terms of seller financing, if any, including the amount, the interest rate and the amortization rate thereof; the terms of assumable financing, if any, including the amount, the interest rate and the amortization rate thereof; and, if applicable, any proposed improvements to the property to be made by the owner in connection with the sale.   Upon execution of such contingent sales agreement, the owner shall provide the  commissioner with a copy of the agreement, which shall be a public record.  Upon receipt of the contingent sales agreement, the commissioner shall immediately make a copy of such agreement available to all qualified entities for their review and consideration. Such qualified entities shall have a period of 120 days, measured from the date of receipt by the commissioner of a contingent sales agreement meeting the requirements of this subsection, to make a bona fide offer to the owner to purchase the affordable housing development from the owner on terms that are economically substantially identical to the terms of the contingent sales agreement submitted by the owner pursuant to the requirements of this subsection.    If, within the 120-day period provided for in this subsection, a qualified entity makes a bona fide offer to the owner to purchase the affordable housing development from the owner on terms that are economically substantially identical to the terms of the contingent sales agreement and agrees to close on the sale within 120 days from the date the parties sign the contract to purchase the development, the owner shall sell the affordable housing development to the qualified entity upon those terms.  If more than one qualified entity submits an offer to purchase the affordable housing development, the owner shall select from among such offers and shall sell the development pursuant to the terms of the selected offer.  The owner shall enter into an affordability preservation agreement with the qualified entity purchasing the affordable housing development.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any owner to extend any form of owner financing to a qualified entity.   If, within the 120-day period provided for in this subsection, a qualified entity fails to  make a bona fide offer to purchase the affordable housing development from the owner on terms that are economically substantially identical to the terms of the contingent sales agreement, or fails to agree to close on the sale within 120 days from the date the parties sign the contract to purchase the development, or fails to close on the sale within 120 days, the owner may sell the development to the non-qualified entity identified in the contingent sales agreement submitted by the owner in accordance with the requirements of this subsection. Provided, however, that any substantial deviation in the terms of sale from those set forth in such contingent sales agreement or the failure of the non-qualified entity identified in such contingent sales agreement to close on the sale of the development shall require the owner to resubmit any new terms of sale to the commissioner for distribution to all qualified entities in conformity with the requirements of this subsection.  (F) Duties of owners exempt from compliance with the State Act.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (G) of this section, if an owner is not required under Section 8 of the Federally Assisted Housing Preservation Act to provide notice to tenants of the owner’s intent to  5  prepay the mortgage, or to terminate participation in the federal program, or to sell or otherwise dispose of the assisted housing development, such owner shall provide such notice to the department, not less than 12 months before the prepayment, termination, sale or disposal occurs, in conformity with the applicable requirements of subsection (C) of this section. It shall be unlawful for such owner to sell an affordable housing development to any person or entity except in accordance with the requirements of subsection (E) of this section, unless the owner enters into an affordability preservation agreement, as defined in subsection (B) of this section, with a  non-qualified entity.   (G) Exceptions. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any government taking of an assisted housing development by eminent domain or negotiated purchase, or to prevent any forced sale of a development to an entity not affiliated with the owner pursuant to a foreclosure.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the requirements of this section, except the provisions of subsection (C) of this section, shall not apply to any sale or other disposition of assisted housing in a manner pursuant to which the development after the sale or other disposition continues to be assisted housing as defined in subsection (B) of this section.  (H) Duties of owner relative to existing tenancies. To the extent allowed by HUD, an  owner shall (1) maintain in good standing any available HUD Section 8 contract, executed pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, during the notice period set forth in subsection (C) of this section and during both of the 120-day periods identified in subsection (E) of this section; and (2) refrain from taking any action, other than notifying HUD of the owner’s intention to prepay the mortgage, or to terminate participation in the federal program or to sell or otherwise dispose of the development, that would preclude a qualified entity or other potential purchaser of the development from succeeding to the contract or negotiating with the owner for purchase of the development during the time periods set forth in item (1) of this subsection. No owner shall disturb any tenancy, other than for a just cause eviction, during the time periods set forth in item (1) of this subsection.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 3,523 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Indiana Avenue, from E.  95th Street to E. 99th Place, and in E. 97th Street, from S. Michigan Avenue to S. Prairie Avenue.  The old pipe dates back to 1915, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Beale’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Anthony Beale               9th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                  Do you wonder what was happening in 1915?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:         BILLIE HOLIDAY           In Washington D.C., the first stone of the Lincoln Memorial was put into place.     The U.S. House of Representatives rejected a proposal granting women the right to vote.      Pluto was photographed for the first time, but not recognized as a planet.    John B. Gruelle was given a patent for his Raggedy Ann doll.    American jazz and blues singer Billie Holiday was born.    The first stop sign appeared in Detroit, Michigan.    Woodrow Wilson became the first President to attend a World Series game.                         WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 3,523 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Indiana Avenue, from E. 95th Street to E. 99th Place, and in E. 97th Street, from  S. Michigan Avenue to S. Prairie Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1915 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in August. Final restoration will follow in September. Dates may change depending  on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN ANTHONY BEALE   773-785-1100      PETE SCALES – DEPARTMENT OF WATER MANAGEMENT        312-744-8822                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in August. Final  restoration will follow in September. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are  at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

By late April 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Reliable Contracting &  Equipment Company crews will begin the work to install 982 feet of new 24-inch and 65 feet of  new 36-inch water main in the intersection at S. Ashland Avenue and W. Harrison Street and W.  Harrison Street, from S. Morgan Street to S. Halsted Street.  The old water main dates back to 1878,  and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  27th Ward Office:312-432-1995  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.

The applicant’s dwelling unit is located in a single family home that is not the applicant’s primary residence;  2. The applicant’s dwelling unit is located in a building containing two to four units, where the dwelling unit is   not the applicant’s residence;    3. To increase the number of units allowed to be used for short term residential rental activity in a building   containing two to four dwelling units.  Approval Criteria  A Commissioner’s Adjustment will not be granted unless the BACP Commissioner determines that such an  adjustment would eliminate an extraordinary burden on the applicant in light of unique or unusual circumstances  and would not detrimentally impact the health, safety, or general welfare of surrounding property owners or the  general public.   The BACP Commissioner may review several relevant factors to determine whether the proposed short term  residential rental provider and short term residential rental should be granted a Commissioner’s Adjustment, in  accordance with Section 4-14-100 (for shared housing units) or Section 4-6-300(l) (for vacation rentals). BACP will  solicit a recommendation from the Alderman in whose ward the unit is located.   To advise the BACP Commissioner, please thoroughly discuss the following factors as they apply to your request:  1. Relevant Geography 2. Relevant Population Density 3. Degree to which the sought adjustment varies from the prevailing limitations 4. The size of the relevant building and the number of units contemplated for the proposed use 5. The legal nature and history of the applicant 6. The measures the applicant proposes to implement to maintain quiet and security in conjunction with the   use  7.

After  reviewing  relevant  law  and  after  conferring  with  the Department  of  General  Services  (DGS),  the  Board  has  determined  that  the Governmental Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit you from purchasing a City-owned lot under ANLAP.   FACTS:    The facts upon which our opinion is based come from your letter, staff conversations with you, our review of ANLAP’s enabling ordinance, and consultation with the Department of General Services.   ANLAP is administered by DGS.  Under the enabling Ordinance which established this program, homeowners in certain areas of the City may purchase City-owned vacant  lots  for  less  than  market  value.    In  order  to  qualify  for  ANLAP,  the prospective buyer must own and occupy the property immediately adjacent to the vacant lot; the vacant lot must be zoned residential; the appraised fair market value of the vacant lot must not exceed $10,000; and the prospective buyer must not be delinquent in the payment of real estate taxes or have any outstanding debt with the City of Chicago.  The minimum bid for purchase of property under this program is $300.00.  Upon receipt of a bid for property under ANLAP, DGS sends notice by regular and certified mail to the owners of the other properties adjacent to the lot in question,  informing  the  owners  of  the  bid,  without  revealing  the  amount,  and providing them with an opportunity to submit a sealed bid for the parcel for a period of thirty days from the date of the mailing of the notice.  The bids are then opened by the Department at a public meeting convened before a certified court reporter. All bids which conform to the requirements of ANLAP are then referred to the City Council committee having jurisdiction over the disposition of City-owned real estate, which then holds a public hearing.  The City Council may accept the higher bid by a majority vote, or may reject both bids by a vote of three-quarters of its members.   You state that you have already submitted a minimum bid of $300.00 to purchase the lot  at  [1234  Avenue].    DGS  has  informed  Board  staff  that  you  meet  all  the requirements for submitting this bid under ANLAP.  The Department also states that it sent notice to the owner of the other adjacent property ([1235 Avenue]) informing him of your bid and that this letter was returned as undeliverable.  The Department of  General  Services  confirmed  that  it  has  concluded  the  owner  of  the  adjacent property is not the occupier of the property, and is therefore not qualified to bid under ANLAP.  The Department also reports that the lot has an appraised value of “over $5,000.00.”  Finally, you have stated that as an employee of the Department  Case No. 00010.A June 14, 2000 Page 2   of [          Y                ], you do not participate in the making of any decisions concerning ANLAP, nor do you have occasion to be involved in any aspect of the ANLAP program.   LAW:      The  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance  provision  most  relevant  to    your  case  is  Sec.  2-156-110 (Interest in City Business). This provision states that:   ...Unless sold pursuant to a process of competitive bidding following public notice, no elected official or employee shall have a financial interest in the purchase of any property that (i) belongs to the City, or (ii) is sold for taxes or assessments, or (iii) is sold by virtue of legal process at the suit of the City.    Sec. 2-156-010(l) of the Ordinance defines “financial interest,” in relevant part, as any interest with a cost or present value of $5,000.00 or more.  ANALYSIS:     Under these provisions, then, City employees are prohibited from having a financial interest in the purchase of City property unless it is sold through a process of competitive bidding after public notice has been given.  Assuming for purposes of this opinion that the reported assessed property value of “over $5,000.00"" is its “present value” within the meaning of Section 2-156-010(l), your purchase of the property would be prohibited under Section 2-156-110, unless sold pursuant to public notice and competitive bidding.1  It is the Board’s opinion that the property sold through the ANLAP procedures described above meet both these requirements of the Ordinance.  Under ANLAP, city-owned vacant lots may only be purchased by the owner/occupier of the adjacent property–in this case, yourself and an owner/occupier of [1235 Avenue]. Therefore, public notice of the opportunity to purchase the vacant lot need only be given to those individuals who meet the requirements under ANLAP.  The public notice requirement of the Ordinance was fulfilled when the Department of General Services sent the owner of the [1235 Avenue] property a letter informing him of your bid.  At that point, the process of competitive bidding also began, as this individual, if qualified, could have also bid for the property.   The fact that this individual was not qualified to bid is no more relevant that if he had been qualified to bid, but chose not to.   The Board concludes that the [1234 Avenue] property is being sold pursuant to a process of competitive bidding following public notice, and that City employees are not prohibited from purchasing such property under Sec. 2-156-110.  Finally, although you have stated that as an employee of the Department of [            Y         ], you have no occasion to be involved in any aspect of the ANLAP program, we caution you that under Sections 2-156- 030(a) and 080(a), you would be prohibited from making, participating in making, or using your position with the City to influence any City decision or action relating to your purchase of the lot in question.    DETERMINATIONS:     The Board determines that the Governmental Ethics Ordinance does not prohibit  1The Board is not concluding or determining that a property’s “assessed value” is its “present  value” for purposes of interpreting Sec. 2-156-010(l) and -110.    Case No. 00010.A June 14, 2000 Page 3  your purchase of the [1234 Avenue] property under the ANLAP program.  The Board’s determination is based on the application of the Ordinance to the facts recited in this opinion.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify us, as a change in these facts may alter our conclusion.

Section 4-156-030(B) of the Amusement Tax Ordinance, chapter 4-156 of the  Municipal  Code  of  Chicago,  requires  every  amusement  tax  collector  to  keep  accurate  books  and  records  of  its  business  or  activity,  specifically  including  original  source  documents.  Pursuant to this requirement, every  amusement tax collector must retain one  of the following:     a.   Admission tickets in the form and containing such information as provided  by section 2 below;          b.   c.   Cash register receipts; or   Such  other  records  in  a  form  previously  approved  in  writing  by  the  director of revenue.     Section 2.  If tickets are used, each ticket shall consist of at least two parts; one part shall  be issued to the patron, the other part shall be retained by the tax collector.  Each part of  the ticket shall state on its face the name and address of the place where the amusement is  being held, the amount paid for the ticket and the date of the event.  Tickets issued for  amusements that do not have a specific address where the amusement is held, such as  boat  tours  or  horse-and-carriage  rides,  shall  state  the  location  where  the  tour  or  ride  begins.  Tickets shall be issued in numerical order, and each part shall contain the same  serial number.    Section 3.  If an amusement tax collector retains both cash register receipts and admission  tickets, the admission tickets do not need to comply with section 2 of this ruling.    Section 4.  All source documents required by section 4-156-030(B) shall be retained for  at least four years after the end of the calendar year in which they are created; provided,  however, that an operator on an annual basis may request approval from the director of  revenue to discard source documents that were created more than one year earlier, and  the  director  will  grant  approval  if  he  or  she  determines  that  the  operator’s  source  documents contain all information required by section 4-156-030(B) and this ruling.     Section 5.  Pursuant to section 3-4-310 of the Uniform Revenue Procedures Ordinance,  chapter 3-4 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, tax collectors who violate section 4-156- 030(B) and this ruling shall be subject to  the fines and penalties set forth in section 3-4- 310, including a fine of not less than $50.00 nor more than $200.00 for the first offense.   The failure of a tax collector to retain required source documents also may result in the  department of revenue estimating additional amusement tax liability and issuing the tax  collector a tax determination and assessment.
