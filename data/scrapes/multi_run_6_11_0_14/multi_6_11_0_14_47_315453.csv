All of the Property lies wholly within the boundaries of the Central West   Redevelopment Project Area (as hereinafter defined).   G.   Pursuant to an ordinance adopted by the City Council of the City (the ""City   Council"") on February 16, 2000 and published at pages 25277 through 25409 of the Journal of  the Proceedings of the City Council (the ""Journal"") of such date, a certain redevelopment plan  and project (the ""Central West Redevelopment Plan"") for the Central West Tax Increment  Redevelopment Project Area (the ""Central West Redevelopment Project Area"") was approved  pursuant to the Illinois Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, as amended (65 ILCS  5/11-74.4-1, et seq.) (the ""Act"") (the ""Approval Ordinance"").   H.   Pursuant to an ordinance adopted by the City Council on February 16, 2000, and   published at pages 25410 through 25420 of the Journal of such date, the Central West  Redevelopment Project Area was designated as a redevelopment project area pursuant to the Act  (the ""Designation Ordinance"").   I.   Pursuant to an ordinance adopted by the City Council on February 16, 2000, and   published at pages 25421  through 25432 of the Journal of such date, tax increment allocation  financing was adopted pursuant to the Act as a means of financing certain redevelopment project  costs (as defined in the Act) incurred pursuant to the Central West Redevelopment Plan (the  ""Adoption Ordinance"").   J.   Pursuant to an ordinance adopted by the City Council on March 12, 2008, and   published at pages. 81982 through 81991 'of the Journal of such date, the Central West  Redevelopment Project Area was expanded and the Central West Redevelopment Plan was  amended to, among other things, adopt tax increment allocation financing for certain additional  parcels (the ""Amending Ordinance"") (the Approval Ordinance, the Designation Ordinance, the  Adoption Ordinance and the Amending Ordinance, collectively, the ""TIF Ordinances"").   K.   Under 65  ILCS 5/11-74.4-3(q)(7) ofthe Act, such incremental ad valorem taxes   which pursuant to the Act have been collected and are allocated to pay redevelopment project  costs and obligations incurred in the payment thereof (""Increment"") may be used to pay all or a  portion of a taxing district's capital costs resulting from a redevelopment project necessarily  incurred or to be incurred in furtherance of the objectives of the redevelopment plan and project,  to the extent the municipality by written agreement accepts and approves such costs (Increment  collected from the Central West Redevelopment Project Area shall be known as the ""City  Increment"").   L.   The City wishes to make available to the Park District a portion of the City  Increment in an amount not to exceed $465,000 (the ""City Increment Assistance"") for the  purpose of funding the Project costs (the ""TIP-Funded Improvements"") to the extent and in the  manner provided in this Agreement.   2   M.   The TIF Ordinances contemplate that tax increment financing assistance would be  provided for public improvements, such as the Project, within the boundaries of the Central West  Redevelopment Project Area.   N.   0.   The Park District is a taxing district under the Act.   In accordance with the Act, the TIF-Funded Improvements shall include such of   the Park District's capital costs necessarily incurred or to be incurred in furtherance of the  objectives of the TIF Ordinances, and the City has found that the TIF-Funded Improvements  consist of the cost of the Park District's capital improvements that are necessary and directly  result from the redevelopment project constituting the Project and, therefore, constitute ""taxing  districts' capital costs"" as defined in Section 5/11-74.4-3(u) ofthe Act.   P.   The Open Space Impact Fee Ordinance, Chapter 18 of Title 16 ofthe Municipal   Code of Chicago, authorizes collection of fees as a condition of issuance of a building permit for  proposed new dwelling units to ensure that adequate open space and recreational facilities are  available to serve residents of new developments in the City (the ""Open Space Fees"").   Q.   The City's Department of Revenue has collected Open Space Fees derived from  new dwelling units built in the Near West Side Community Area and contiguous communities  (the ""Fee-Paying Developments"") and has deposited such Open Space Proceeds in Fund No. 28  131  54 5028 2604.   R.   DPD wishes to use proceeds from the Open Space Fees in an amount not to  exceed $445,081.52 (the ""Open Space Assistance""), for the purpose of partially funding the  construction of park improvements on the Property, to create a park which will provide open  space and recreational facilities for the benefit of the residents of the Near West Side Community  Area.   S.   The City and the Park District wish to enter into this Agreement whereby the Park  District shall undertake the Project and the City shall (1) take the lead in obtaining an NFR letter  from the IEPA (as such terms are defined herein); (2) convey the Property to the Park District  once the Park District has completed the Project; (3) reimburse the Park District for the TIP(cid:173) Funded Improvements made pursuant to the Project with City Increment Assistance in an  amount not to exceed $465,000; and (4) grant Open Space Assistance in an amount not to exceed  $445,081.52 (the City Increment Assistance and the Open Space Assistance, collectively, the  ""Project Assistance"").   T.   By ordinance adopted on December 14, 2011, the Board of Commissioners ofthe   Park District authorized the acceptance of the Property from the City and the execution of this  Agreement.   U.   On January 18, 2012, the City Council adopted an ordinance published in the   Journal for said date at pages 18500 to 18536 (the ""Authorizing Ordinance""), authorizing 2FM   3   and DPD to (i) approve the conveyance of Property from the City to the Park District; (ii)  approve the use of the City Increment Assistance for the purposes set forth herein; (iii) approve  the use of not to exceed $250,000 in Open Space Assistance for the purposes set forth herein;  (iv) make a finding that the expenditure of the Open Space Fees as described herein will directly  and materially benefit the Fee-Paying Developments from which the Open Space Fees were  collected; and (v) to enter into this Agreement.   V.   On January 15, 2014, the City Council adopted an ordinance published in the   Journal for said date at pages 73061  to 73064, authorizing an increased allotment of not to  exceed $195,081.52 in Open Space Fees for the Project due to increased costs since the 2010  estimate, and made a finding that the additional Open Space Fees will directly and materially  benefit the Fee-Paying Developments from which the Open Space Fees were collected.  The total  amount of Open Space Fees is an amount not to exceed $445,081.52, which amount equals the  Open Space Assistance amount.   W.   The parties acknowledge that, notwithstanding any text or implication herein to   the contrary, as of the Closing Date, the following has occurred:   - the Property has been remediated; and  -the Final NFR Letter (as defined herein) was obtained and has been recorded  against the Property; and  - the City granted a right of entry to the Park District for the construction and  development of the Project; and  - the Park District completed the construction and development ofthe Project.

The Park District shall comply with all  applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, codes and  executive orders, all as may be in effect from time to time, pertaining to or affecting the Project  or the Park District as related thereto.   1.4   The Park District shall also provide the City with copies, if any shall apply, of all   governmental licenses and permits required to construct the Project and to use, occupy and  operate the Property as a public park from all appropriate governmental authorities,   1.5   The Park District shall include a certification of compliance with the requirements   of Sections 1.2,  1.3, and 1.4 hereof with each request for City Increment Assistance hereunder  and at the time the Project is completed. The City shall be entitled to rely on this certification  without further inquiry. Upon the City's request, the Park District shall provide evidence  satisfactory to the City of such compliance.   1.6   Open Space Development Committee Application.  The Park District agrees to  construct the Project on the Property in accordance with the application approved by the Open  Space Development Committee (the ""OSDC"") and prepared by the Park District, dated May 9,  2011 (the ""Application""), which was approved on May 9, 201 1 by the City and the OSDC.  No  material deviation from the Application may be made without the prior written approval of the  City which will not be unreasonably withheld.   SECTION 2.  FUNDING.   2. 1.   The City shall, subject to the Park District's satisfaction of the conditions   precedent for disbursement described in this Section 2 and such other conditions contained in  this Agreement, disburse the Project Assistance to the Park District.   2.2.

The City shall not execute Certificates of Expenditure in  the aggregate in excess of the actual costs of the Project that are either TIF-Funded or Open  Space Impact Fee-Funded improvements.  Prior to each execution of a Certificate of Expenditure  by the City, the Park District shall submit documentation regarding the applicable expenditures  to DPD.  Delivery by the Park District to DPD of any request for execution by the City of a  Certificate of Expenditure hereunder shall, in addition to the items therein expressly set forth,  constitute a certification to the City, as of the date of such request for execution of a Certificate  of Expenditure, that:   5   (a)   (b)   (c)   (d)   the total amount of the request for the Certificate of Expenditure represents the  actual amount payable to (or paid to) the general contractor, subcontractors, and  other parties who have performed work on or otherwise provided goods or  services in connection with the Project, and/or their payees;   all amounts shown as previous payments on the current request for a Certificate of  Expenditure have been paid to the parties entitled to such payment;   the Park District has approved all work and materials for the current request for a  Certificate of Expenditure, and such work and materials conform to the Plans and  Specifications previously approved by DPD; and   the Park District is in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws,  statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, codes and executive orders, all as may be  in effect from time to time, pertaining to or affecting the Project or the Park  District as related thereto.   2.3.   The City shall have the right, in its discretion, to require the Park District to   submit further documentation as the City may require in order to verify that the matters certified  to in Section 2.2 are true and correct, and any execution of a Certificate of Expenditure by the  City shall be subject to the City's review and approval of such documentation and its satisfaction  that such certifications are true and correct; provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall  be deemed to prevent the City .from, relying on such certifications by the Park District.,   2.4.

Per  HUD  regulations,  this  second  allocation  requires  the  City  of  Chicago  to  issue  a  substantial  amendment  to  the  CDBG-DR  Action  Plan  (Action  Plan)  released  by  the  City  on  August  11,  2014.  This  requirement  is  published in the Federal Register/Volume 79, No. 106, Docket No. FR-5696-N-09.    This substantial amendment (Substantial Amendment) updates and revises the following portions  of the Action Plan:   •   •   •   the locations of two of the three infrastructure activities proposed with the first $4.3M  allocation   the unmet needs assessment (now includes additional data on housing and infrastructure)  and   the proposed funding allocations for infrastructure programs and new programs.   Action   Plan   The  website  at  www.cityofchicago.org/grants.  All  sections  of  the  Action  Plan  remain  in  effect,  unless  otherwise noted herein.    available   Chicago   on   the   is   City   of   BACKGROUND   On  April  17th  and  18th  of  2013,  a  storm  system  swept  through  Chicago  that  dropped  approximately 5.5 inches of rain on the City, or the equivalent of a “10-year storm,” the type of  storm  that  occurs  once  every  ten  years  based  on  historical  storm  frequency  tables.  The  storm  brought extensive damage to certain areas of the city which are highly vulnerable to flooding.  The heavy rains experienced during the 2013 flood resulted in sewer overflows, basement floods,  and backflow of water from the Chicago River into Lake Michigan. On April 18, 2013, Illinois  Governor  Pat  Quinn  declared  a  state  of  emergency,  and  38  counties,  including  Cook  County,  were  declared  state  disaster  areas.  By  May  10,  2013,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) issued a Presidential Disaster  Area declaration. As a result, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  initially  allocated  Community  Development  Block  Grant-Disaster  Recovery  (CDBG-DR)  funding  in  the  amount  of  $4.3  million  to  the  City  of  Chicago  to  help  in  recovery  efforts  of  community areas that were most impacted by the storms. On June 3, 2014, HUD allocated the  City of Chicago a second allocation of $47.7 million for recovery efforts.    HUD  requires  an  action  plan  to  guide  the  distribution  of  CDBG-DR  funds  toward  necessary  expenses related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of infrastructure and housing,  or economic revitalization. The City’s Action Plan committed $4.3 million towards a long-term  strategy  of  infrastructure  restoration,  specifically  to  the  water,  sewer  and  drainage  systems  in      Chicago’s south side community areas most distressed by the April floods. The Action Plan was  approved by HUD on August 25, 2014.    This  Substantial  Amendment  revises  the  locations  of  two  of  the  original  three  infrastructure  activities proposed in the Action Plan. (See chart below.) The City will not use CDBG-DR funds  to complete the Escanaba Avenue and 108th Street Sewer Improvement Projects and will identify  other sources of funding to complete these activities. The City will use CDBG-DR funds for the  125th Street Sewer Improvement Project.

The City’s Substantial Amendment will commit an  additional  $47.7  million  towards  a  series  of  projects  to  continue  to  aid  in  the  recovery  and  remediation  from  the  April  2013  flood.  Specifically,  the  City  will  again  commit  CDBG-DR  funds  to  public  infrastructure  restoration  and  updating,  including  water,  sewer  and  drainage  systems in the Chicago community areas most distressed by the April floods. With this round,  the  City  proposes  to  commit  $35  million  towards  these  public  infrastructure  projects  while  committing  $10.3  million  to  housing  rehabilitation  for  homeowners  and  renter  assistance  and  mitigation  measures.  The  City  will  also  devote  $2.4  million  to  administrative  costs,  including  oversight,  planning,  and  monitoring  costs.  The  proposed  activities  are  outlined  in  the  table  below.   The use of CDBG-DR funds will be consistent with HUD requirements to satisfy “unmet needs”  that  have  not  been  satisfied  by  other  public  or  private  funding  sources  like  FEMA  Individual  Assistance funds, Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loans, or private insurance. In  addition, per HUD requirements, the plan also ensures that CDBG-DR funds are spent fully on  the City areas most impacted by the April storms and only on community areas located within  the City’s jurisdiction. These requirements are published in the Federal Register/Volume 78, No.  241, Docket No. FR-5696-N-07.                     3 | P a g e            PROPOSED REVISED BUDGET    FIRST AWARD: $4.3*   SECOND AWARD $ 47.7*   TOTAL: $52. 0*          *expressed in millions   CDBG-DR  1ST  2ND   AWARD   AWARD            MATCH  TOTAL COST   NOTES   ADMINISTRATIVE COST  Project: Planning and  Administration  PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE   Project: Street Sewer  Repair  Project: Albany Park  Tunnel Mitigation   HOUSING PROJECTS     Project: Single- and  Multi- Family Homeowner and  Renter Assistance Program   $0   $  2.40    $0    $  2.40    $4.30   $25.00    $26.07   $55.37   $0   $10.00   $39.00   $49.00   $0   $10.30   $0   $10.30   Total  $4.30   $47.70   $65.07    $ 117.07      HOUSING OVERVIEW   City oversight, planning  and monitoring   New sewers to address  damage from inundation  Infrastructure  improvements to mitigate  future flooding   Rehabilitation and  mitigation program for  single and multifamily  housing and assistance  for renters      After additional consultation and review of the unmet housing needs in the City of Chicago with  respect to the flood of April 2013 (see unmet need below), the City of  Chicago has allocated  CDBG-DR funds to housing for homeowners and renters of single- and multi-unit buildings in a  manner responsive to the unmet housing needs. Specifically, the City will support a homeowner  assistance program and a mitigation measures program to provide funds to home and property  owners  to  reduce  the  occurrence  or  frequency  of  flooding.  Chicago’s  housing  recovery  and  assistance programs will also incorporate sustainability and resiliency measures by focusing on  modern  building  standards,  green  building  technology  and  energy  efficiency  into  the  reconstruction process, where feasible. The City will prioritize the needs of LMI households in  its homeowner and renter programs. The City also will dedicate additional funding specifically to  assist  special  needs  populations  impacted  by  the  storm.  The  City  affirmatively  promotes  fair  housing  through  its  housing  programs,  following  all  applicable  federal  and  state  statutes  and  regulations, and vigorously enforcing fair housing laws. The City  will continue to ensure that      4 | P a g e       housing assistance is prioritized and allocated based on financial hardship and disaster-related  need, without regard to race or ethnicity.   HOUSING AND RENTER UNMET NEEDS    After the submission of the Action Plan, the City of Chicago reached out to FEMA for additional  homeowner data regarding homeowner and renter damage claims related to the 2013 flood that  were unaddressed and unmet. Below are two tables identifying the unmet needs of homeowners  and  renters  in  response  to  the  flooding.  According  to  the  tables  below,  there  is  still  a  sizable  amount of unmet housing need. The assistance provided to owners and renters did not meet the  FEMA  verified  loss  (FVL).  In  both  instances  there  was  a  $2.5  million  gap  in  the  amount  of  damage assessed and the amount awarded.

The model contains three basic components. The first is the existing sewer pipe network in the  City  of  Chicago.  The  second  component  included  in  the  model  is  the  land  use  factors  that  determine runoff. This includes the amount and location of impervious  or paved surfaces, the  features  that  restrict  flows  (like  flow  restrictors  in  sewer  catch  basins),  and  the  number  of  building downspouts that are disconnected from the sewer system. The third component of the  model is the amount of rainfall that is expected from different types of storms.    The model creates outputs such as runoff volumes, water levels in the sewers, and flow metrics  such as total volume, peak flow, or amount of combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The City can  evaluate how changes to the inputs of the model, such as  an increase in  rainfall, reduction in  impervious surfaces, or the size of sewer pipes, result in different model outputs such as flood  risk reduction, CSO frequency reduction, and reduced inflows to treatment plants.    The City used its computer sewer model to analyze areas of flood risk following the April 2013  storms. The City identified areas that have insufficient sewer capacity and were inundated during  these rain storms. When sewers are inundated, the stormwater runoff backs up out of the sewers  and flows back into basements and streets. Each of the 17 projects are located in an area that has  insufficient sewer capacity and contains a flood risk that was exceeded by the volume of rainfall  received during the April 2013 storms.    The  second  analysis  performed  by  the  City  was  to  examine  calls  received  to  the  City’s  311  system. The City’s 311  system is  a phone-  and  web-based portal where  citizens can log non- emergency complaints or requests for assistance. The City tracks two types of calls to 311 related  to flooding: water-in-basement and water-in-street. The City believes this is a good proxy for the  location of actual flooding since 311 calls represent known occurrences of flooding by citizens.  However, the City also believes that 311 calls often underrepresent flooding occurrences for a  variety of reasons. Some citizens may not call 311 because they don’t know about the system  and/or they choose to handle their flooding situation on their own. The City evaluated 311 calls  during the events of April 17-18, 2013 to understand which areas experienced flooding. Each of  the  17  sewer  projects  selected  for  CDBG-DR  funding  are  located  adjacent  to  areas  that  had  reported flooding to the City’s 311 system. See Appendix 1 for a map of the 17 sewer projects  overlaid with 311 calls for flooding.    The City’s third analysis was an evaluation of the areas of Chicago that received a high volume  of  applications  for  FEMA  Individual  Assistance  in  connection  with  federal  declaration  4116- DR_IL. Since these applications were made for funding in response to flood damage, the City  believes that this data set is another good proxy for actual flooding occurrences. Specifically, the  City evaluated those zip codes that received higher rates of applications and compared those to  the  level  of  basement  flooding  risk  from  the  city’s  hydraulic  computer  sewer  model  and  the  occurrence of 311 calls during the April 2013 storms. Each of the 17 sewer projects selected for      15 | P a g e

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street. Among other things:           RICHARD J. DALEY      •  Animal Crackers were introduced to the American public.  •  Theodore Roosevelt became the first American President to ride in an automobile.  •  The first college football bowl game, the Rose Bowl between Michigan and Stanford,   was held in Pasadena, California.   •  JC Penney opened its first store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming.  •  The Texas Oil Company, Texaco, was formed.  •  Denmark became the first country to adopt fingerprinting as a way to identify criminals.  •  Richard J. Daley was born; he served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in   1976.                          CENTRAL AVE., HADDON AVE. & AUGUSTA BLVD.    WATER PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be i installing 2,977 feet of 12-inch  and 2,716 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Central Avenue, from W. Division Street to W.  Chicago Avenue, W. Haddon Avenue, from N. Central Avenue to N. Long Avenue, and W.  Augusta Boulevard, from N. Central Avenue to N. Long Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consist of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further the old  pipe dates back to 1902 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the job to be  completed in mid August 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Central Avenue, W. Haddon Avenue and W.  Augusta Boulevard outside of our working hours. When we are working in the street, we have to  close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business,  even if it means putting a metal plate in place. Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open  for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS                                              24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN DEBORAH L. GRAHAM   773-261-4646   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid August 2014.  This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is  any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 4,545 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Burnham Avenue, from  350’ north of E. 83rd Street to E. 87th Street, and in E. 83rd Street, from S. Marquette Avenue to  S. Exchange Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1891, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Pope’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman John Pope             10th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                    Do you wonder what was happening in 1891?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                    Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap   and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.                                       WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 4,545 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Burnham Avenue, from 350’ north of E. 83rd Street to E. 87th Street, and in E.  83rd Street, from S. Marquette Avenue to S. Exchange Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1891 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in August. Restoration will follow in September. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN JOHN POPE   773-721-1999      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE          312-742-1029                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in August.  Restoration will be completed in September. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since  we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Developments subject to  ARO (see below) must set aside 10% of residential units as affordable housing OR donate $100,000 per required unit to the City’s  Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund. For projects receiving financial assistance from the City, 20% of the units must be affordable.   The ARO was revised again in 2015: Projects submitted to the City after October 13, 2013 will be subject to the 2015 ARO.    Projects are generally subject to the ARO if they include ten or more residential units AND:    □  Receive a zoning change that:      permits a higher floor area ratio (FAR);    changes from a non-residential to a residential use;     permits residential uses on ground floor, where that use was not allowed;   Include land purchased from the City (even if purchase was at the appraised value);    □  □  Receive financial assistance from the City; OR  □  Are part of a Planned Development (PD) in a downtown zoning district.     Generally, Projects are exempt from the ordinance if    □  Land was purchased between May 13, 2005 and May 13, 2007; OR   □  Zoning Changes or PDs filed with the Zoning Administrator before August 21, 2007.   2015 Maximum Household Income to lease or purchase affordable units      For-sale housing must be affordable to households earning  100% of the area median income (AMI) as defined by the US  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Using  these income guidelines, the City’s uses a formula, based on  the market price, assessments, and projected property taxes  specific to each development to determine the unit’s maximum  affordable price. Rental housing must be affordable to  households earning 60% of the AMI. If Financial assistance is  provided to a project, income limits are reduced.    Affordable units are typically placed in the Chicago Community Land Trust (CCLT), which ensures the unit’s long-term  affordability. The Department of Planning & Development income-qualifies purchasers/renters, and may provide marketing  assistance.

I am very happy to be  here today to discuss the 2014 budget request for the Department of Buildings (DOB).  As you  may have heard, I have been nominated by Mayor Emanuel to serve as the next Chief Executive  Officer  of  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority.    While  this  will  be  my  final  time  before  you  as  Building Commissioner it is by no means goodbye.  If I may, I do want to take a moment to  thank  Mayor  Emanuel  and  the  members  of  the  City  Council  for  the  tremendous  honor  and  opportunity to serve our fellow Chicagoans as Building Commissioner.  Together, I believe we  have  made  the  building  permitting  and  inspection  processes  more  efficient,  responsive  and  customer-friendly.      Like  previous  years,  we  are  taking  many  steps  to  improve  service,  streamline  processes  and  provide innovative approaches to managing this department.      Our  goal  continues  to  be  maintaining  our  core  services  to  citizens  and  positively  impacting  public  safety.    Thanks  to  efficiencies  gained  by  adopting  technologies  and  the  cost  savings  derived  from  transferring  projects  in-house,  we  continue  our  mission  while  maintaining  the  integrity of our work.      We  are  pleased  to  report  that  through  September,  2013,  DOB  revenues  were  $36,817,915,  an  increase of $ 4,638,319 – 14 percent more than 2012.     We are also dedicated to significantly improving customer convenience and decreasing the time  to permit. This year, we continued to enhance our Electronic Plan Review System and Certified  Corrections Program, both of which I am proud to report have been a best-practice model both in  North America and abroad. In addition, we have continued our focused coordination with the  Police Department to keep our streets safe by securing or, when necessary, demolishing vacant  buildings that have been identified as havens for gangs and criminal activity.    Let me share with you more details about these and some of our other specific accomplishments.               Key Accomplishments in 2013    Enhancing Electronic Plan Review    In  July  2012,  DOB  fully  implemented an  Electronic  Plan  Review  system  (E-Plan).    E-Plan  facilitates multiple discipline review and tracking of projects through every step of the review  process.    This  system  allows  design  professionals  to  submit  plans  electronically  from  the  convenience of their offices and allows multiple DOB plan reviewers to examine and approve  plans simultaneously.  Architects no longer have to schedule in-person meetings at City Hall to  submit or pick up plans and corrections.      This program has been implemented through the willing participation and cooperation of users  and  members  of  the  design  community,  along  with  the  hard  work  of  DOB,  DHED  and  DoIT  staff.       As of today, DOB has issued more than 6,790 permits utilizing E-Plan.      Our  success  has  already  been  noticed,  as  we  have  been  contacted  regarding  E-Plan  by  other  major municipalities, including New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Salt Lake City, Atlanta,  Dallas, Toronto, Ontario and as far away as Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.      E-Plan has also provided us with the opportunity to better coordinate the overall efforts of other  departments that are involved in the building permit process.     This year, we have enhanced E-Plan to make the process even quicker and more user-friendly.  I  would be remiss not to mention the working partnership we have with the design community, as  the success of E-Plan is due in large part to the buy-in of this community.  Over 1,800 members  of  the  design  community  have  attended  one  of  our  E-Plan  workshops,  orientation  sessions  or  round tables.  Many of the system enhancements were a direct result of the on-going dialogue  with the design community.      Just this month, we added data regarding the Time to Permit on the permit.  As you are aware,  there are instances where the end-user, be it the homeowner or the business owner, will call us or  your office expressing frustration about the permit time.  The new time to permit data, which is  printed  directly  on  the  permit, will  reflect:  the  date  that  the design  professional  submitted  the  application and drawings for review, the number of days that the application and drawings were  being reviewed by the City, and the number of days that the application and drawings were back  with the design professional for correction.  For instance, if a permit took 45 days from filing to  issuance, the physical permit will state that it was with the City for 20 days and with the design  professional for 25 days.  This information will allow for an accurate and transparent reporting of  the time to permit back to the end-user homeowner or business owner.     Mandatory Certified Corrections Program    DOB has fully implemented the Certified Corrections Program.  This program allows DOB to  issue permits for plans that require corrections to comply with the Municipal Code, by having the   architect certify the corrections have been made and submit those correct drawings to DOB.  A  DOB inspector then verifies that the corrections are adhered to and construction is done to Code  as part of the permit field inspection.  This program decreases the number of DOB staff reviews  and the time to permit.      Streamlining our permit and inspection process will be ever more important to businesses and  residents as the economic recovery gains more strength.      Enforcement of Vacant Properties    Demolitions    In July of 2012, Mayor Emanuel announced a new initiative in which DOB worked closely with  the Chicago Police Department to identify, secure and in some cases demolish vacant buildings  to stop gangs from using the buildings as gathering places and centers for illegal activity.  That  successful working partnership with CPD continues to this day, and since its inception we have  demolished a total of 395 buildings.    To date in 2013, DOB has demolished 125 buildings to remove these hubs of violence from our  communities.    Overall  this  year,  as  part  of  our  ongoing  work  to  demolish  dangerous  and  hazardous buildings in the city, DOB has demolished an additional 247 buildings, for a total of  372  buildings  demolished  this  year.    DOB  estimates  that  we  will  board  up  and  secure  1,100  properties and demolish more than 500 dangerous and hazardous buildings (including garages)  overall in 2013.       As  of  October  1,  2013,  the  DOB  Demolition  unit  inspections  have  led  to  1,271  cases  on  the  demolition call in Cook County Circuit Court.  To date this year, 8,405 vacant buildings have  been registered as required under the vacant building ordinance.       Strategic Task Force (STF)/ Drug and Gang House Enforcement    The Department of Buildings is working closely with the Chicago Police Department and the  Department of Law to enforce the Drug and Gang House ordinance.  This program helps keep  neighborhoods and school passages safe by holding building owners responsible for the activities  inside their buildings.  It also encourages landlords to properly screen all new tenants and to take  actions against those that are destroying communities or risk significant fines and other actions.      As  of  October  1,  2013,  the  DOB  Strategic  Task  Force  had  conducted  approximately  90  inspections of buildings referred to DOB by CPD.  Working with CPD, STF has closed down 66  problem businesses that were determined to have dangerous and hazardous conditions.  STF will  continue to actively partner with CPD in 2014.    Inspection Efficiencies   The  Department  of  Buildings  continues  to  examine  ways  to  reduce  the  number  of  individual  DOB staff visits to sites, thus offering more efficiency to the City, while continuing to assure  public safety and enforce the City’s Code.       Inspections    Our team of inspectors will complete an estimated 235,000 inspections in 2013, which include an  estimated 45,000 complaints received via 311.      We  handle  a  wide  variety  of  inspections  at  DOB.  We  inspect  restaurants  and  other  small  businesses  to  make  sure  they  are  up  to  Code.    We  inspect  signs  to  ensure  residents  are  safe  walking  in  the  public  way  under  a  large  sign  and  carnival  rides  in  the  summer  to  make  sure  everyone  is  having  “safe”  fun.    We  do  annual  inspections  on  a  wide  range  of  devices  and  buildings in the City and visit sites throughout Chicago when a complaint comes into 311 stating  that local homes or businesses may not be in compliance with the Municipal Code.     Restaurant Inspection Program    The  Department,  in  coordination  with  the  Mayor’s  Innovation  Delivery  Team,  implemented  a  new  restaurant  inspection  program  in  June  of  2012.    The  new  initiative  gives  restaurants  the  option  of  having  all  building  trade  inspections,  mainly  mechanical,  electrical  and  plumbing,  performed the same morning as opposed to on separate days.  This saves time for the restaurant  owner and allows them to open their doors more quickly, thereby boosting the neighborhood and  City  economy  and  quality-of-life  and  creating  jobs  in  the  community.    To  date,  over  600  restaurants have taken advantage of this new initiative.  We hope to build upon the success of  this initiative and roll it out to other types of new businesses.        Signage/Billboards    Electrical  inspectors  from  the  Department  inspect  the  approximately  37,000  permitted  signs  every other year, with approximately 18,500 signs inspected annually.  To date, 700 signs have  been  cited  for  violations,  which  may  include  damaged  or  neglected  electrical  or  structural  components or lack of a proper permit.         As part of a collaborative effort with other City departments, DOB not only continues to address  the overall issue of unpermitted signage, but our staff also continues to ensure compliance with  the updated sign provisions of the Municipal Code. DOB inspectors now attend Administrative  Hearings to present their findings on the re-inspections of the illegal signage.     As you are aware, the City Council has imposed a moratorium on dynamic image display signs  of  100  square  feet  or  less  until  April  30,  2014.    These  signs,  which  are  much  brighter  than  conventional  signs  and  which  fluctuate  in  level  of  brightness,  have  raised  legitimate  concerns  from residents, especially when the signs are shining or creating a strobe effect in neighboring  windows at night.     DOB,  along  with  DHED,  BACP  and  Law,  are  utilizing  the  moratorium  period  to  conduct  research and work with aldermen to recommend a reasonable balance in regulating these signs.   We have reached out to other municipalities to gather best practices and share ideas.  We have  gone out in the field at night to examine the issues and we have listened to members of City  Council who shared the concerns of both the residents and businesses in their community.  Our  interdepartmental working group hopes to present several options for your consideration well in  advance of the moratorium’s expiration date.        Another  benefit  of  the  interdepartmental  working  group  is  the  creation  of  a  single  sign  application.  As  you  are  aware,  businesses  and  advertisers  currently  have  two  separate  applications: a DOB sign application with a DHED sign supplement and a BACP public way use  sign application. This has led to mistakes by applicants and has created a way for people to abuse  the  system.  The  single  application,  which  will  be  implemented  by  year’s  end,  will  not  only  streamline the process for the user but will also eliminate the opportunities for abuse, thereby  providing a level system for honest businesses and advertisers.    If I may, I do want to commend my colleagues at DHED, BACP and Law on the coordinated  efforts on signs.        Individual Programs    There are three other programs I would like to mention.    Life Safety Evaluations    To date, DOB approved the LSE reports for 588 buildings, or approximately 81 percent of the  719  buildings  in  the  Life  Safety  Evaluation  program.    This  program  requires  all  high  rises  in  Chicago built before 1975 to be fully sprinklered or implement an adequate number of fire safety  upgrades in their buildings, verified through a Life Safety Evaluation plan.     These reports, approved by the Departments of Building and Fire, are the precursor to the LSE  inspection.  A total of 63 buildings have now passed the LSE inspection, an increase of 2,000  percent since January of 2012, when only three buildings had passed their inspection.       141 of the buildings that have not had their reports approved have either gone to an LSE training  class or had a meeting with the LSE committee to receive assistance in revising their reports to  obtain a passing score.      The deadline for compliance is January 1, 2015.          Annual Inspection Certification (AIC) Program for Elevators and Other Devices     The Annual Inspection Certification (AIC) program for elevators was developed two years ago  in cooperation with building owners. The program requires that buildings in Chicago’s Central  Business  District  hire  a  qualified  third-party  inspector  to  perform  the  annual  inspection  of   elevator systems and then report the results electronically to DOB in lieu of an annual inspection  conducted by a DOB elevator inspector.     As of October 4, 2013, 1,171 buildings, or 88 percent of the buildings with conveyance devices  in the CBD, had 8,012 devices in the program.      In 2013, DOB continued to focus on enhancing the AIC user website and pursuing enforcement  action against buildings in the CBD that have not yet participated in the program.      The program is currently being expanded beyond the CBD to include large institutions such as  universities, hospitals and sports arenas.      Green Permit Program    The  Department  of  Buildings  continues  to  maintain  Chicago's  reputation  as  a  leader  in  environmental design and construction by offering the Green Permit Program.  Created in 2004,  this program offers financial incentives and expedited service for developers who want to build  green buildings. In 2005, we issued 19 of these permits.  In 2013, we will issue more than 65  green permits.     We are also expanding our green permit initiatives.  In February of this year, we implemented an  expedited  permit  process  for  the  timely  review  and  issuance  of  permits  for  photovoltaic  solar  panels.  Solar panels can be installed on residential or commercial roofs to provide a clean and  cost effective alternative energy source to homes and businesses. We have issued 31 permits for  PV solar permits under this initiative.    Other Initiatives    In additional to the above, we have also worked closely with the City Council, other departments  and  the  community  on  several  key  ordinances  and  programs,  including  the  Keep  Chicago  Renting  Ordinance,  which  protects  tenants  in  foreclosed  rental  properties,  and  the  Bed  Bug  Abatement  Ordinance,  which  provides  education  to  both  landlords  and  tenants  and  requires  a  coordinated approach to addressing the issue of bed bugs.    Moving Forward    Chairman Austin and members of the City Council, during 2013, the Department of Buildings  has taken many steps to make our department more efficient and more transparent.  In the next  year, we plan to continue our efforts to complete more inspections and provide better services to  residents.    We  look  forward  to  our  continued  collaborative  partnerships  with  Aldermen,  residents, businesses, the construction industry and our sister departments, including the CHA, to  ensure that Chicago buildings remain safe.     Department	of	Buildings	 MBE/WBE Data    Period: January  through September 30, 2013  Total Purchases: $13,402,916.53        WBE   Asian   MBE   n/a   $252,845.22 (1.88%)   African‐American   $2,831,926.31 (21.13%)   Hispanic   $0   2014	Budget	Hearing	  WBE   Total MBE/WBE Purchases   $476,565.05 (3.56%)   n/a   n/a   n/a               Total Spending   $3,084,771.53 (23.02%)   $476,565.05 (3.56%)   $3,561,336.58(26.57%)   Staffing Data        Asian  Black   Hispanic  White  Native  American   Total         Department Ethnicity and Gender   Male   Female   9  44  36  108  2   198  79%   3  28  10  11  0   52  21%   Total  12  72  46  119  2   251      Department Managers Ethnicity and Gender   Male   Female   Total   Asian  Black  Native  American   White  Total      Interns   1  1  1   1     1  1  0   0     67%   33%   2  2  1   1       School   Computer Services Institute   Cooley   Hendrix Cooley   IIT  IIT  IIT   Indiana  Intrax  Intrax   John Marshall  John Marshall                Asian  Black   Hispanic  White  Total                              %  5%  29%  18%  47%  1%   100%      %  40%  40%  10%  10%      100%   Gender  Male  Female  Male  Female  Male  Male  Male  Female  Male  Female  Male   %     18%  36%  45%      100%   New Hires Ethnicity and Gender  Male   Female   Total   0  2  3  5  10  91%   0  0  1  0  1  9%   0  2  4  5  11     Race  Asian  White  White  Asian  Asian  Hispanic  White  Asian  Asian  White  White   Total   1  1  1  9  2  1  1  2  7  1  2   Department	of	Buildings	  2014	Budget	Hearing	  Kent   Lake Forest  Lake Forest   Michigan State  Northwestern   Northwestern   Oakton  Purdue  Purdue   SIU   University of Birmingham   University of Illinois  University of Illinois  University of Illinois  University of Illinois   University of Illinois at Chicago   Wisconsin      Female  Female  Male  Male  Male  Female  Male  Female  Female  Male  Female  Female  Male  Female  Male  Male  Female   Asian  White  Black  White  Asian  White  Asian   African American   Asian  White   African American   Asian  Asian  White  White  White  White   2  2  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  1  1  1   Permitting     Department of Buildings     Administration     Building Inspections     Easy Permit   Process     Standard Plan   Review     Developer  Services     Regulatory   Review   and  Code      Compliance  Finance Personnel  Labor Relations  Case   Management     Communications     Licensing     Strategic  Task Force     Conservation     Technical  Inspections ___________  Vacant  Buildings      Boilers Cranes Electrical Elevators  Iron New   Construction Certificate of  Occupancy Plumbing  Refrigeration Ventilation

State Street Chicago, IL 60605  Re:  Case No. 08039.Q  Dear Mr. Medlar:  You are the Youth Materials Specialist for the Chicago Public Library (CPL), and oversee the development and maintenance of the CPL’s English and foreign language childrens’ book collections (which includes buying books for the collection).  On July 31, 2008, you sent us an email, dated July 15, 2008, from the Trade Commission of the Embassy of Spain.  The Commission has invited you and Megan McArdle, CPL’s Director of Collection Development (whose duties also include buying books for the collection), on behalf of the Association of Publishers Guild (“FGEE”) and the Spanish Institute of Foreign Trade (“ICEX”), to attend the LIBER XXVI edition, which will be held in Barcelona, October 8-10, 2008.  According to the materials you sent us, other U.S. librarians and book buyers have been extended the same invitation.  Your expenses, including round-trip Chicago-Barcelona coach airfare, four nights accommodation, show registration and admission tickets to all fair events, will be paid jointly by FGEE and ICEX. According to the written invitation you sent us, “guests should assume expenses surpassing the established conditions...” You would leave Chicago on Monday, October 6 and return Saturday, October 11. You have asked staff whether the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance prohibits you from accepting this offer.  LIBER, which is held annually, is the world’s largest Spanish-language book fair, drawing representatives of over 800 publishing houses, as well as librarians, book sellers and distributors, authors and journalists worldwide.  At LIBER, you will have the opportunity to improve your knowledge of and familiarity with the leading professionals–publishers, booksellers, distributors, authors, journalists, designers and dealers in the Spanish and South American publishing world, as well as sharing ideas and experiences with fellow librarians.  You told staff that your and   Case No. 08039.Q August 5, 2008 Page 2  Ms. McArdle’s attendance at LIBER XXVI would benefit the City and enhance your ability to perform your City duties, and that you both have already received approval for attendance from the Library Commissioner and your immediate CPL supervisors. In addition to this, this year America Reads Spanish is introducing its first Librarian Award, which will be bestowed upon an American librarian responsible for a Spanish collection in his or her library, and whose work has been noticeable during the year.   You will be able to vote for your candidate by sending the Commission an email with the name of the librarian of your choice and if you so wish, the reason why you are recommending that person. Deadline for votes is August 30th, 2008.  From all recommendations, five finalists will be selected, and the winner will announced during the presentation of the librarians in LIBER, on the morning of October 8th. The award will consist of $5,000 and a check will be given to the winner at that time. All 5 finalists will be invited to dinner in a trendy Barcelona restaurant on Thursday, October 9th.  Under § 2-156-040(d) of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance, City employees are not prohibited from accepting hosting expenses, including travel, meals and entertainment, if: (1) the expenses are reasonable; (2) the expenses are furnished in connection with public events, appearances or ceremonies related to official City business; (3) the expenses are furnished by the sponsor of the public event; and (4) the offer is not based upon any mutual understanding that the official decisions or actions of any City employee concerning the business of the City would be influenced.  Based on our review of the written invitation materials you sent us, staff concludes that all the conditions listed in § -040(d) of the Ordinance are met, and thus that the Ordinance does not prohibit you from accepting these travel and hosting expenses.  Our conclusion is consistent with advice we have given to you and other similarly situated employees in the past. (See Case Nos. 06041.Q, 05049.Q, 04038.Q, 03039Q.and 02029.Q). As you noted in your email (and as we have advised you in past years), you will, as a matter of policy, seek the approval of the Mayor’s Chief of Staff for this trip, seeing that it is for overseas travel, and the offer has been extended to two City employees, not one, as in some past years.  Further, based on our review of the written invitation materials you sent us, there would be no prohibition on accepting the award if a Chicago librarian won the Librarian Award described above.  Staff’s conclusion does not necessarily dispose of all issues relevant to this situation, and is based solely on the application of the City’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance to the facts stated in this letter.  If the facts stated are incorrect or incomplete, please notify us immediately, as any change may alter our conclusion.  Other laws or rules also may apply to this situation.  Be advised that City departments have the authority to adopt and enforce rules of conduct that may be more restrictive than the limitations imposed by the Ordinance.  Case No. 08039.Q August 5, 2008 Page 3  We appreciate your inquiry and your concern to abide by the standards embodied in the Ordinance.  If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.  Very truly yours,  Steven I. Berlin Acting Executive Director

In  a letter to our office dated  June  10, 2006, you  requested  an  opinion  addressing  how  the  City's  Governmental  Ethics  Ordinance applies to your representation  of plaintiffs in two  legal proceedings in  which  the  City is  a named  defendant.  Based  on  the  facts  you  presented,  staff  concludes  that  the  Ordinance  does  not  prohibit  you  from  representing  the  individuals  in  these  proceedings, although, as  you  are  aware,  it  does  prohibit  you  from  having  an  economic  interest  in  (i.e.  deriving  any  compensation  or  other  that  representation or those matters.  You  explained to staff that you  are deriving or  accepting  no  compensation  from  either  matter,  and  that  you  have  a  fee  screening  arrangement  in  place  for  one  of  the  matters;  as  long  as  these  conditions  remain  true,  your  representation  in  both  proceedings,  as  you  have  described  it, is  in  compliance with the  requirements  of the  relevant provision of  the Ordinance.   interest  capable  of  being  valued   in  monetary  terms   from)   [K   is  pending  before   involve  legal  You  explained  that  none  of  your  duties  as  [in  U]  representation  of the  City or [U]  In  your capacity as  an  attorney (you  maintain  ),  you  currently represent  a law practice: the Law Office of [John  Smith]  In  the  first,  your  client  is  a  [U]  employees  in  two  distinct  legal  proceedings.  v.  City  of  Chicago],  petitioner  in  a  formal  grievance  (captioned  , for  IDHR/EEOC  no.  2006  CF  xxxxx)  filed  against the  City,  specifically  [U]  gender  discrimination.  This  proceeding  Illinois  the  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Department  of  Human  Rights  and  In  the second case,  pending  in  the Circuit Court of Cook County,  Commission.  (captioned  [N  v.  H]  ),  there  are  two  counts.  The  first  count,  in  which you  have filed an  appearance on  behalf of and  represent the  plaintiff, is a  civil suit for libel against another [U] employee in  her personal capacity; the City  is  not  a  party.  The  second  count  involves  allegations  by  this  same  plaintiff  against the same  [U]  employee,  in  her official  capacity,  and  the  City.  You  said  that  another  attorney,  [Mr.  F)  (who  is  listed  as  ""Of  Counsel""  to  the  Law  Office  of  [John  Smith]  )  represents  the  plaintiff  in  this  second  count-you  do  not  represent  the  plaintiff  in  that  count.  You  explained  to  staff  that two separate lawsuits could  have been filed  in  this matter,  but that one was  filed  for administrative  reasons.  You  also  said  that,  in  both  the  [K and N v.  H]  matters,  you  are  accepting  no  compensation-they  are  entirely  pro  bono.  Further,  you  explained, there  is  a fee  screening  arrangement in  place  between  in the [N v. H] matter-you will accept no direct or indirect  you and Mr. [F)  compensation  (such  as  substituted  payments)  from  [Mr.  F)  or  [Mr.  N]  with  respect to any recovery made or fees charged.   Section  2-156-090 of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance provides,  in  relevant part:   Case No. 06034.0  June 21,  2006  Page 2   (b)  No  elected  official  or  employee  may  have  an  economic  interest  in  the  representation  of,  any  person,  in  any judicial  or  quasi-judicial  proceeding  before  any  administrative agency or court in  which the City is a party and  that person's interest is  adverse to that of the City.   ""Economic interest"" is  defined at 2-156-010(i) of the  Ordinance as"" ... any interest valued  or capable  of valuation in  monetary terms.""  Under§ 090(b}, you,  as a City employee,  are prohibited from  having  an  economic  interest  in  the  representation  of any  person  in  any judicial  or  quasi-judicial  proceeding  before  any  administrative  agency  or  court  in  which  the  City  is  a  party  and  that  person's  interest  is  adverse to that of the City.  Clearly,  both the [ K and N v.  H]  matters meet the  criterion of§ 090(b).  Therefore,  Board  staff  concludes  that,  although  §  2-156-090(b)  does  not  prohibit  you  from  representing  the  plaintiffs/claimants  in  these  cases,  it  does  prohibit  you  from  having  an  economic  interest  in  that  representation-meaning  that  you  are  prohibited  from  accepting,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  anything  of value for your  legal  representation  in  either lawsuit,  including  any  replacement  payments or other compensation stemming from  [Mr.  F's] representation of the plaintiff in  the [N v.  H]  matter.  See Case No.  95004.A.  You  explained to staff that you  have taken  on  both  representations  completely  pro  bono; moreover,  you  said,  you  have  a fee  screening  arrangement with  [Mr.  F] under  which you  have fully disclaimed any recovery or fees  he collects in the [N v. H] matter.  Provided that  these  conditions  remain  true,  staff  also  concludes  that  your  representation  in  both  proceedings  complies with  the  requirement of the  relevant  provision  of the  Ordinance.  See  Case  Nos.  93007.A;  01 028.A;  01 005.A.   Our  conclusions  do  not  necessarily  dispose  of all  issues  relevant  to  your  situation,  but  are  based  solely on  the application  of the City's Governmental  Ethics Ordinance to  the facts  stated  in  this  letter.  Board  staff  has  not  addressed  whether  any  provisions  of Illinois  law,  including  the  Illinois  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct (Article VIII  of the  Rules  of the  Supreme Court of Illinois),  may also apply,  and  we advise you to seek legal counsel as to their applicability.   Please  note  that,  if the  facts  presented  in  this  letter are  incomplete  or  incorrect,  you  are  advised  to  notify  us  immediately,  as  any  change  may  alter  our  conclusions.  Be  further  advised  that,  because  your letter to this agency requesting  this opinion  copied  [Mr. C]  [U's]  Counsel  (in  addition  to  your  clients),  we  will  be  consulting  with  him  in  this  matter.

Introduction   Report Purpose   The City of Chicago is currently involved in a comprehensive process of encouraging redevelopment  of many industrial areas within the City.  The redevelopment of these industrial areas is an important  component of the City's overall economic development strategy.   The City of Chicago engaged S.B.  Friedman &  Company to conduct a tax  incremental financing  eligibility study and prepare a plan under the provisions of the IJRL.  This report is the combined  Eligibility Study and Redevelopment Plan for the West Pullman Industrial Park Conservation Area  and was prepared under the provisions of the IJRL.   The West Pullman IPCA represents an opportunity for the preservation, retention, redevelopment,  and expansion of industry in an area that has traditionally been industrial in nature but has suffered  disinvestment  over the  past  twenty  to  thirty  years.  Few  locations  within  the  City  offer a  solid  industrial history, diverse transportation system (expressways as well as  public transportation), an  accessible industrial workforce, and a  population of trainable working-age residents.  These factors  are  important  in  the  locational  decision  making  of industrial,  storage,  and  distribution-oriented  businesses.   The purpose of the West Pullman IPCA is to create a mechanism to allow for the development of  new  industrial  and  industrial  support  facilities  on  existing  vacant  or  underutilized  land,  the  redevelopment  and/or  expansion of existing  industrial  businesses,  and  the  improvement  of the  physical environment and infrastructure.  The redevelopment of the West Pullman IPCA is expected  to encourage economic and industrial revitalization within the community and surrounding area.   This report covers the events and conditions that exist and were determined to be germane at the  completion of our research on August  17,  1997  and  not  thereafter.  These events or conditions  include, without limitation, governmental actions and additional development that may have changed  any of the observed conditions made on or before August 17,  1997.   This Eligibility Study and Redevelopment Planning and Project Plan (the ""Plan"" or ""Redevelopment  Plan"") summarize the analysis and fmdings of the consultant's work, which, unless otherwise noted,  is solely the responsibility of S. B.  Friedman &  Company.  The City of Chicago is entitled to rely on  the findings and conclusions of the Plan in designating the West Pullman IPCA as an Industrial Park  Conservation Area under the  IJRL.  S.B.  Friedman &  Company has  prepared this  Plan with the  understanding that the City would rely (1) on the findings and conclusions of the Plan in proceeding  with the designation of the West Pullman IPCA and the adoption and implementation of the Plan,  and (2) on the fact that S.B.  Friedman &  Company has obtained the necessary information so that  the  Plan  will  comply  with  the  IJRL  and  that  the  West  Pullman  IPCA  can  be  designated  as  a  Redevelopment Planning and Redevelopment Project Area in compliance with the IJRL.

The Commission is responsible for recommending to the City Council which individual buildings, sites, objects, or districts should be designated as Chicago Landmarks, which protects them by law.  The landmark designation process begins with a staff study and a preliminary summary of informa-  tion related to the potential designation criteria.  The next step is a preliminary vote by the landmarks commission as to whether the proposed landmark is worthy of consideration.  This vote not only initiates the formal designation process, but it places the review of city permits for the property under the jurisdic- tion of the Commission until a final landmark recommendation is acted on by the City Council.  This Landmark Designation Report is subject to possible revision and amendment during the designation process. Only language contained within the designation ordinance adopted by the City Council should be regarded as final.  Cover:  The  Village  Theatre  at  1546-1550  N.

Designed by German-born architect Adolph Woerner exclusively for motion picture use, the building was completed in 1916 and was part of a theater chain operated by Herman L. Gumbiner.  This fine brick and terra cotta-clad building is a mix of Classical Revival and Renaissance Revival styles, incorporating Germanic symbolism in its details reflecting the area’s then-prominent ethnic group.  The building served for many decades as the sole movie house in the neighborhood and remains a strong visual landmark on the Near North Side.  EARLY CHICAGO MOVIE THEATERS  The first movie houses in Chicago, built in the first decade of the twentieth century, were family- owned storefront operations known as nickelodeons after the common price of admission.  They were sparsely decorated, smoky places, often no more than storefronts with a hanging sheet or a white-washed wall to act as a screen.  Chairs were moveable and placed in rows, and at the rear of the room sat the projector with the operator, who might also act as the ticket vendor.  This type of theater eventually gained a bad reputation for attracting only the working class and was not considered the type of establishment suitable for women and children.  In spite of unsophisticated surroundings and presentations, these early movie theaters attracted ever increasing audiences, spurred by the rise of the motion picture industry and the creation of full-length movies such as The Great Train Robbery, filmed in 1903.   (Before the movie industry moved to California, Chicago was the center of both the emerging motion picture studio and distribution industries beginning in 1907-08.)  1  Beginning in 1908, municipal code reforms were passed and nickelodeons moved from storefronts to larger and often more sumptuous buildings (often defunct vaudeville theaters). Since the reforms required operators obtain movie-house licensing, it gave the more affluent clientele a sense of safety and, as a result, raised the level of respectability of the movie house. By the early 1910s, “purpose-built” movie theaters, buildings designed expressly for the showing of motion pictures, began to be built in Chicago.  Although larger than nickelodeons, these theaters remained relatively small in scale, fitting easily into neighborhood commercial strips in Chicago’s many neighborhoods.  The vast majority of these first-generation movie theaters have been demolished or remodeled for other purposes.  The Biograph Theater (1914), designated a Chicago Landmark in 2001, and the Village Theatre (1916) are among the best of these that remain.  By the 1920s, Chicago was “the jumpingest movie city in the world and had more plush elegant theatres than anywhere else,” according to movie historian Ben Hall.  The demand for motion pictures encouraged the construction of larger-scale theaters holding between 2,000 and 4,000 movie-goers.  Built by major theater operators such as Balaban and Katz, Lubliner and Trinz, and the Marks Brothers, these movie “palaces”—including the Chicago, Uptown, New Regal, and Congress theaters (designated Chicago Landmarks in 1983, 1991, 1992 and 2002, respectively)—were major centers of entertainment both in the Loop and outlying neighborhoods.  Meant to create an environment of fantastic illusion for movie patrons, the typical movie palace took its design cues from historic architectural revival styles such as Renaissance and Baroque. Its facade would be richly detailed with terra cotta while a lighted marquee and giant sign proclaimed the theater’s presence for blocks.  Upon entering, a patron experienced a grand lobby, often with sweeping staircases, and a lavish auditorium.  With interiors detailed with elaborate stone and plaster work, decorative light fixtures, and plush seats, these theaters became in effect extensions of the films being shown, with their often exotic storylines and locales.  By the end of the 1920s, Chicago had more than thirty of these movie palace theaters.  The economic dominance of these later movie theaters caused many of the “first-generation” movie theaters to be converted to non-movie use.  In turn, beginning in the 1950s and accelerating in later years, a decline in movie-going, coupled with suburban development and changing motion picture exhibition practice, led to the construction of smaller movie theaters clustered in “multiplexes” and the destruction or drastic remodeling of most of these grandly-scaled movie theaters.  BUILDING DESCRIPTION  The Village Theatre’s original owner, German-born Frank Schoeninger, arrived from Newport, Wisconsin, sometime after 1900 and settled in the Lincoln Park area on Wrightwood Ave.  In 1911, he purchased a parcel of land located on the southwest corner of Clark St. and North Ave. which was then the epicenter of the German community on the North Side.  The parcel,  2  Above: A current photo of the Village Theatre (with the taller adjacent Germania Club at left).  Below: A location map of the Village Theatre (outlined).  The building was originally named the Germania Theater, likely due to its proximity to the Germania Club, as well as to attract a more affluent clientele such as frequented the club.

Below: Movie advertisement for the Germania Theater (Chi- cago Tribune, 20 June 1917).  4  The 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s saw their number swell enormously, with over 300,000 German- speaking immigrants arriving in Chicago during those three decades.  By 1900 native-born Germans and their children made up almost a quarter of the city’s population.  These new Chicagoans settled in all parts of the city.  However, several neighborhoods became strongly German in population and character, including the Near Northwest Side along Milwaukee Avenue between downtown and North Avenue; the area around Humboldt Park; and the “Heart of Chicago” neighborhood near Damen Avenue and 22nd Street (now Cermak Road).  But the most prominent local community of Germans was the North Side.  As early as the 1850s, a German neighborhood had arisen north of Chicago Avenue and east of Clark Street, where many new immigrants had established breweries and other businesses.  Others had established small farms in the area now known as the Old Town Triangle, west of Clark Street.  After the Chicago Fire of 1871, many of these Germans moved farther north, to the Lincoln Park neighborhood and to Lake View, a suburb that was annexed to Chicago in 1889.  At the turn of the century, Germans were a dominant force on the North Side, forming a majority of citizens in the area bounded by Division, Belmont, Lake Michigan, and the Chicago River.  Wealthy German businessmen built fine homes near Lincoln Park and Lake Michigan, while middle- and working- class families lived in small, affordable cottages and flat buildings farther west.  North Avenue was rapidly becoming one of the chief commercial streets for the North Side’s German-American community.  It developed especially after 1887, the year of the Yondorf Block and Hall’s construction (designated a Chicago Landmark in 2001), when newly established streetcar service along North Avenue made the area readily accessible.  A tour brochure of 1938 called the street the “Unter den Linden of Chicago,” referring to Berlin’s famous boulevard of fashion and culture.  A former president of the North Avenue Business and Improvement Association (William Rauen, in a 1930 interview) recalled it as a bustling street by 1890, built up with dozens of stores, including clothiers, shoemakers, confectioners, tobacco shops, druggists, bakers and grocers.  Rauen remembered: “The language spoken along the street was nine-tenths German and there was no occasion for folks from Tier, Luxembourg, the Rhineland and Bavaria to feel homesick.”  A columnist for the Chicago Tribune (Alex Small, 1957) remembered that during the street’s heyday, “One could not get around North Avenue without that language [German].”  THE ARCHITECTURAL STYLE OF THE VILLAGE THEATRE  Architects of the first-generation movie houses sought a middle ground between the flamboyance of vaudeville theaters and the dinginess of the storefront nickelodeons.  In the early 20th century, classical forms were traditionally used in theater designs, and occasionally infused with Italian- or French-influenced elements.  Theaters, like libraries and government buildings, were sober public spaces that represented the “moral middle,” with no seating arrangements governed by rank.  By 1914 theatre operators realized that people came to the movies to escape the grind of their daily worries, so efforts were made to facilitate this escapism by requesting that theater architects  10

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,968 feet of 8-inch water main in W. Arthur Avenue, from N.  Glenwood Avenue to N. Sheridan Road, N. Magnolia Avenue, from W. Arthur Avenue to W.  Devon Avenue, and N. Lakewood Avenue, from W. Arthur Avenue to W. Devon Avenue. The  old pipe dates back to 1911, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman O’Connor’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Patrick O’Connor           40th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         Do you wonder what was happening in 1911?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:         LUCILLE BALL        Crisco, the all-vegetable shortening, was introduced.    On November 11, a record cold snap (later known as The Great Blue Norther) hit the   midwest United States. Many cities broke record highs and lows on the same day.     The Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre. It was recovered in 1913.    Ground breaking began in Boston for Fenway Park.    An audience threw vegetables at actors for the first recorded time in the U.S.    Lucille Ball was born.    The South Pole was reached for the first time, by Norwegian Roald Amundsen.                        ARTHUR AVE., MAGNOLIA AVE. & LAKEWOOD AVE. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,968 feet of 8-inch  water main in W. Arthur Avenue, from N. Glenwood Avenue to N. Sheridan Road, N. Magnolia  Avenue, from W. Arthur Avenue to W. Devon Avenue, and N. Lakewood Avenue, from W.  Arthur Avenue to W. Devon Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1911 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in mid September 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Arthur Avenue, N. Magnolia Avenue, and N.  Lakewood Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to  close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business,  even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open  for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN PATRICK O’CONNOR   773-769-1140   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in mid September  2014. This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Background  The Lease Tax Ordinance, chapter 3-32 of  the Municipal Code of Chicago (“Code”),  imposes a Tax on the lease or rental in the  city of personal property.  As of the date of  this Informational Bulletin, the rate of the  Tax is 9% of the lease or rental price.  The  incidence of the Tax and the obligation to  pay the Tax are upon the lessee of the  personal property, but the lessor is  responsible for collecting it. See Code  Sections 3-32-030 and 3-32-070. It is the  duty of each lessor to collect the Tax from  the lessee at the time of each lease or  rental payment, and to remit the Tax to the  Chicago Department of Finance  (“Department”).  Id.    Application of the Lease Tax to  cell tower leases  In general, for agreements that involve both  a lease of personal property and the lease of  real property, or the sale of a service, the  lessor is required to separate the taxable  lease or rental portion from the nontaxable  portion. If the lessor fails to separate the  lease or rental portion of the price charged  from the non-taxable portion, the entire  price charged shall be deemed taxable,  unless it is clearly proven that at least 50%  of the price is not for the use of any  personal property. If this occurs, then the  portion not representing the use of personal  property would be non-taxable. See  Department Lease Tax Ruling #7, Section  5.    Safe Harbor for computation of  Lease Tax on cell tower leases  Because the lease or rental of space on cell  towers generally involves not only the lease  of personal property but also the lease of  real property, and possibly the sale of a   service, the Department offers a safe harbor  for collection and remittance (by a lessor) or  for payment (by a lessee). Specifically, the  Department will not assess additional taxes    DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE   INFORMATIONAL BULLETIN   Lease Tax on Cell Towers     Additional Questions?

You may also contact us by email at:  taxpolicy@cityofchicago.org or by phone  at 312-747-4747.          on cell tower lessors who timely remit the  Tax based on 40% of the total consideration  charged for the lease or rental of space on  their cell towers. The purpose of the safe  harbor is to promote administrative  convenience and avoid disputes.    Example: A lessor charges its  customer $1,000 per month for  the lease or rental of space on its  cell tower, the use of its real  property and the provision of  certain services. The lessor may  compute the Lease Tax due using  the safe harbor as follows:      $1000 charge x 40% safe harbor  rate = $400 taxable amount  $400 taxable amount x 9% tax  rate = $36.00 Lease Tax due per  month    Lessors who choose not to rely on this  40% safe harbor rate must report 100% of  lease or rental charges and then deduct all  non-lease charges to compute the taxable  amount. If upon audit the Department  determines that the non-lease charges were  overstated, additional Tax due will be  assessed, along with applicable interest  and penalties.    Payment and filing requirements  for cell tower lessors  For all periods beginning after February 1,  2016, all lessors are required to collect and  remit the Lease Tax and file applicable  returns pursuant to the Uniform Revenue  Procedures Ordinance, chapter 3-4 of the  Code, on all transactions involving the lease  or rental of space on cell towers.    Accordingly, lessors must remit the Lease  Tax to the Department on the 15th day of the  month following collection of the Tax and  file an annual return on the 15th day of  August following the end of the fiscal year,  which ends on June 30. This may require a   lessor to register with the Department for  payment of the Lease Tax.

By	mid	May	2017,	Department	of	Water	Management	(DWM)	and	NPL	Construction	Company	 crews	will	begin	the	work	to	install	3,356	feet	of	new	12‐inch	water	main	in	N.	Cicero	Avenue,	from	 W.	Addison	Street	to	W.	Belmont	Avenue.	The	old	water	main	dates	back	to	1908,	and	needs	to	be	 replaced.		 	If	you	would	like	to	receive	regular	email	updates	about	the	progress	of	the	project,	please	go	to	 BuildingANewChicago.org	to	register	for	the	WaterALERT	program.		Simply	enter	your	name,	 email	address	and	the	project	identification	number	at	the	top	of	this	letter.	 	By	signing	up	for	the	WaterALERT	emails,	you	will	be	notified	as	the	project	enters	each	new	 construction	phase	–	from	our	mobilization	of	equipment	onto	the	site,	to	the	installation	of	new	 pipes,	to	the	final	restoration	of	the	street.	 	When	we	are	working	in	the	street,	we	may	close	or	limit	it	to	traffic	for	safety	reasons,	but	you	will	 always	be	able	to	reach	your	home	or	business.		Outside	of	working	hours,	a	travel	lane	will	be	left	 open	for	local	traffic	only.		 	We	will	post	our	work	area	for	“No	Parking”	as	needed	during	work	hours	(generally	7am‐4pm).		 Parking	outside	of	those	hours	will	be	allowed,	but	cars	will	need	to	be	moved	by	the	start	of	the	 next	workday.		We	will	try	to	preserve	as	much	parking	space	as	possible.	 	We	know	that	construction	always	involves	inconveniences	and	noise.	We	will	do	everything	 possible	to	maintain	your	quality	of	life	throughout	these	projects,	and	conducting	ourselves	as	 good	and	thoughtful	neighbors	in	the	course	of	our	presence	on	your	street.		 	Should	you	have	any	questions	or	concerns,	you	can	either	ask	the	construction	foreman	during	the	 project,	or	call	any	of	the	following	numbers:	 	   24‐Hour	City	Service	and	Information	Line:		311	   31st	Ward	Office:	773‐278‐0031	   DWM	Office	of	Public	Affairs:		312‐744‐6635	 	     Genwmnot03032016   	 Flushing	after	Your	Service	Line	has	been	Connected	to	the	New	Water	Main		  When	we	switch	over	the	services	from	the	old	main	to	the	new	water	main,	we	will	interrupt	water	 service.		We	give	you	24‐hour	notice	when	this	is	to	happen.		However,	in	the	event	of	an	emergency	 shutdown	during	construction,	we	may	not	be	able	to	give	you	prior	warning.	 	Now	that	your	old	water	main	has	been	replaced	and	your	water	service	has	been	connected	to	the	 new	water	main,	it	is	important	to	flush	your	plumbing	of	any	sediment,	rust	or	metals,	including	 any	lead	to	maintain	water	quality.			 	Sediment,	rust	and	metals,	including	any	lead	may	collect	in	the	aerator	screen	located	at	the	tip	of	 your	faucets.		These	screens	should	be	removed	prior	to	flushing.	 (1)	Please	find	the	closest	available	tap	(an	outside	 hose	spigot,	laundry	sink	faucet	or	bathtub)	to	where	 the	water	comes	into	the	home	that	is	not	used	for	 drinking	water.	Fully	open	the	cold	water	tap	and	let	 the	water	run	for	at	least	5	minutes.		Next	flush	any	 other	cold	water	faucets	on	that	floor	for	at	least	5	 minutes.		 (2)Move	to	the	next	highest	floor	and	repeat.	 (3)	Move	to	additional	floors	in	sequence	and	flush									 any	taps	or	faucets	for	at	least	5	minutes.		 			If	you	have	any	questions	or	concerns	about	your	water	quality,	or	if	you	would	like	your	water	 tested,	please	call	us	at	311.		For	additional	advice	and	information	visit	 http://www.epa.gov/il/advice‐chicago‐residents‐about‐lead‐drinking‐water.	 	 If	your	water	line	has	been	idle	or	stagnant	for	more	than	6‐hours,	it	is	advised	that	you	flush	for	at	 least	5	minutes	to	maintain	water	quality.		This	may	include	flushing	the	toilet,	taking	a	shower	and	 doing	laundry.			 	 Lastly,	if	you	don’t	already	have	one,	I	ask	you	to	consider	the	installation	of	a	water	meter	in	your	 home	to	help	you	save	money	on	your	water	bill.
