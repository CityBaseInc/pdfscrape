This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner our local government with you,  our customers. As part of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the  project. You should know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will install a new sewer main in S. St. Lawrence Avenue, from E. 49th Street to E. 48th  Street, and in E. 48th Street, from S. St. Lawrence Avenue to S. Forrestville Avenue.  The old  pipe dates back to 1892, and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Dowell’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.

That’s the year the old sewer main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:         ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE                               Former President Abraham Lincoln’s birthday was declared a national holiday in the   United States.     Arthur Conan Doyle published The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.    Ellis Island became a new reception center for immigrants.    The first basketball game was played.    The escalator was patented by inventor Jesse W. Reno.    Macadamia nuts were first planted in Hawaii.    Tchaikovsky’s ballet, “The Nutcracker Suite”, made its debut.          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon install a new sewer main in S. St.  Lawrence Avenue, from E. 49th Street to E. 48th Street, and in E. 48th Street, from S. St.  Lawrence Avenue to S. Forrestville Avenue.      Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1892 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by 47th  Street on the north, 49th Street on the south, Champlain Avenue on the east, and Forrestville  Avenue on the west will benefit from increased drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work begins shortly, and is scheduled to be completed in April. Final restoration of the  damaged streets/parkways will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other  factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic:   When we are working in the street, we may have closures to “through traffic”. You  will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in  place. Safety is our first consideration.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Dowell, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.             Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

The Respondent was at all times mentioned herein employed as a detective by the   Department of Police of the City of Chicago.   2.   The written charges, and a Notice stating when and where a hearing on the charges was   to be held, were served upon the Respondent more than five (5) days prior to the hearing on the   charges.   3.   Throughout the hearing on the charges the Respondent appeared in person and was   represented by legal counsel.   4.  The Respondent, Detective John Killackey III, Star No. 20163, charged herein, is guilty   of violating, to wit:   Rule 1:  Violation of any law or ordinance,     in that the Superintendent proved by a preponderance of the evidence the following charge:      Count I: On or about April 23, 2009, in the vicinity of 1945 North Winchester Avenue,  Chicago, while off duty, Detective Killackey committed aggravated assault in that he pointed a  firearm at Karl Clermont and stated, “Either I don’t owe you shit or you get out of the car and  see what’s gonna happen,” or words to that effect, in violation of 720 ILCS 5/12-2(a)(1).     On April 23, 2009, Detective Killackey, while off duty, was out drinking at a bar carrying a   Glock 27 handgun. He left the bar at approximately 1:00 a.m., and entered a taxi cab being driven   by Karl Clermont. He directed Mr. Clermont to drive him to Armitage and Damen. The fare was   approximately $8.00. Detective Killackey admits those salient facts.    The credible testimony in this case also established that Detective Killackey got out of the   taxi without paying Mr. Clermont. When Mr. Clermont told Detective Killackey he forgot to pay,        2   Police Board Case No. 14 PB 2847  Detective John Killackey    Detective Killackey responded by saying: “No, I didn’t forget to pay. I don’t owe you shit.” (Tr.                     46.)  Mr. Clermont advised Detective Killackey that if he did not pay the fare he would call the   police. Detective Killackey responded by pulling his Glock 27 handgun, pointing it at Mr.   Clermont, and saying: “You choose. Either I don’t owe you shit, or you get out of the car and see   what happens.” (Tr. 47.) These actions were undoubtedly a violation of 720 ILCS 5/12-2(a)(1) as it   existed at the time of this incident in April 2009. 1       Subsequently, Mr. Clermont called 911 and advised them that a man had just pulled a   Glock handgun on him. When Police Officer Torres arrived, Mr. Clermont showed him the   direction in which Detective Killackey headed.  Thereafter, several Chicago Police Officers   apprehended Detective Killackey in an alley behind his home, which was a short distance from the   Armitage & Damen location.   They each drew their weapons and pointed their guns at him.   At   least two officers instructed him to show his hands, and told him to stop and get down on the   ground, or words to that effect.   At least one of them smelled alcohol on his breath, and noticed   that Detective Killackey was “staggering.” (Tr. 170.) A gun was retrieved from his person.       Detective Killackey’s testimony that he did not point his weapon at Mr. Clermont was not   credible. It is noteworthy in this regard, that at the hearing in this matter, for the first time,   Detective Killackey stated that he pointed his phone and finger at Mr. Clermont, not his gun.   However, Detective Killackey made no mention of this in either of his statements to the   Independent Police Review Authority.  Detective Killackey admitted that he reached for, and put   his hand on his gun, though he denied actually pulling his weapon on Mr. Clermont.       Mr. Clermont testified that he is familiar with firearms and was certain that Detective   Killackey pulled either a Glock or a Beretta gun on him. Most tellingly, Mr. Clermont also told the                                                     1  720 ILCS 5/12 was subsequently amended.        3   Police Board Case No. 14 PB 2847  Detective John Killackey    911 Emergency Dispatcher that: “He has a 9mm Glock.” (Superintendent’s Exhibits 4 & 5) He                     also gave Sergeant Peabody a description of the weapon Detective Killackey brandished that was   consistent with the weapon Detective Killackey in fact possessed that night.  As noted above, by   his own admission, Detective Killackey was in fact carrying a Glock 27 handgun. The totality of   the evidence when considered as a whole, including Detective Killackey’s testimony and   statements that he had a Glock in his possession, supports Mr. Clermont’s version of the events.   The Board is convinced that Detective Killackey pulled his gun on Mr. Clermont, as evinced by   Mr. Clermont being able to so accurately describe Detective Killackey’s weapon to the 911   operator.      The Board finds Mr. Clermont’s testimony credible and Detective Killackey’s testimony   not credible, and therefore finds that the Superintendent established that Detective Killackey is   guilty as charged.            5.  The Respondent, Detective John Killackey III, Star No. 20163, charged herein, is guilty   of violating, to wit:   Rule 1:  Violation of any law or ordinance,     in that the Superintendent proved by a preponderance of the evidence the following charge:      Count II: On or about April 23, 2009, in the vicinity of 1945 North Winchester Avenue,  Chicago, while off duty, Detective Killackey committed theft of services in that he refused to  pay the taxi fare he owed to taxi driver Karl Clermont, in violation of 720 ILCS 5/16-3(a).       See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 4 above, which are incorporated here by   reference.   Detective Killackey denied that he refused to pay Mr. Clermont. He testified that he paid   the fare of $8.26 by giving Mr. Clermont $9.00, but that Mr. Clermont was not satisfied with that        4   Police Board Case No. 14 PB 2847  Detective John Killackey    tip. However, the Board finds credible Mr. Clermont’s testimony that Detective Killackey got out                     of the taxi without paying, and finds Detective Killackey’s denial not credible. Moreover, both Mr.   Clermont and Officer Torres testified that after Detective Killackey was disarmed by the police in   the alley behind his home, Officer Torres asked Mr. Clermont if he wanted Detective Killackey to   just pay the fare, or did Mr. Clermont want to file a formal complaint. This evidence supports the   position that Detective Killackey had not paid the fare. Nonetheless, even without considering the   consistent statements of Mr. Clermont and Officer Torres, in as much as the Board finds credible   Mr. Clermont’s testimony regarding the events that took place on April 29, 2009, and finds   Detective Killackey’s version of the events not credible, it therefore finds that the Superintendent   established that Detective Killackey is guilty as charged.  2       6.  The Respondent, Detective John Killackey III, Star No. 20163, charged herein, is   guilty of violating, to wit:   Rule 2:  Any action or conduct which impedes the Department’s efforts to achieve its policy   and goals or brings discredit upon the Department,     in that the Superintendent proved by a preponderance of the evidence the following charge:      Count I: On or about April 23, 2009, in the vicinity of 1945 North Winchester Avenue,  Chicago, while off duty, Detective Killackey pointed a firearm at Karl Clermont and stated,  “Either I don’t owe you shit or you get out of the car and see what’s gonna happen,” or words  to that effect, thereby impeding the Department’s efforts to achieve its policy and goals or                                                     2   The Board finds not credible Lieutenant Peabody’s testimony that Mr. Clermont told him that Detective Killackey   had given him some unknown sum of money (it is also an out of court statement being offered to prove the truth of the  matter asserted), and finds that Peabody was a biased witness. The totality of the testimony made it abundantly clear  that Lieutenant Peabody (Sgt. Peabody at the time of the incident at issue in this case) was biased. He attempted to  dissuade Mr. Clermont from filing a complaint against Detective Killackey. Moreover, Lieutenant Peabody did not  inventory Detective Killackey’s weapon, and in fact returned it to him, despite knowing that Mr. Clermont was  alleging that Detective Killackey had threatened him with a gun.  Finally, it is noteworthy with respect to Lieutenant  Peabody’s clear bias, that he was ultimately suspended for five days for failing to complete the case report as required  regarding this incident. Illinois courts have long applied the rule that a witness may be impeached by a showing of  bias, interest, or motive to testify falsely. See People v. Bull, 185 Ill.2d 179, 206, 235 Ill.Dec. 641, 705 N.E.2d 824  (1998). The Board did not believe Lieutenant Peabody’s testimony in this regard.       5   Police Board Case No. 14 PB 2847  Detective John Killackey                       bringing discredit upon the Department.     See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 4 above, which are incorporated here by   reference.                7.  The Respondent, Detective John Killackey III, Star No. 20163, charged herein, is guilty   of violating, to wit:   Rule 2:  Any action or conduct which impedes the Department’s efforts to achieve its policy   and goals or brings discredit upon the Department,     in that the Superintendent proved by a preponderance of the evidence the following charge:      Count II: On or about April 23, 2009, in the vicinity of 1945 North Winchester Avenue,  Chicago, while off duty, Detective Killackey refused to pay the taxi fare he owed to taxi driver  Karl Clermont, thereby impeding the Department’s efforts to achieve its policy and goals or  bringing discredit upon the Department.     See the findings set forth in paragraph no. 5 above, which are incorporated here by   reference.        8.  The Respondent, Detective John Killackey III, Star No. 20163, charged herein, is guilty   of violating, to wit:   Rule 2:  Any action or conduct which impedes the Department’s efforts to achieve its policy   and goals or brings discredit upon the Department,     in that the Superintendent proved by a preponderance of the evidence the following charge:      Count III: On or about April 23, 2009, while off duty, Detective Killackey carried a firearm  knowing there was a likelihood that he would be consuming alcoholic beverages and/or  consumed one or more alcoholic beverages while carrying his firearm, thereby impeding the  Department’s efforts to achieve its policy and goals or bringing discredit upon the Department.     The Respondent pled guilty to this charge.            6   Police Board Case No. 14 PB 2847  Detective John Killackey                         The issue before the Board is not whether the case against Detective Killackey was   ultimately disposed of via a post-conviction sentence that allowed for his record to be expunged.   Rather, the issue is whether Detective Killackey’s being found guilty of violating 720 ILCS   5/12-2(a)(1) and 720 ILCS 5/16-3(a) on May 27, 2010, in the Circuit Court of Cook County in   People v. John E. Killackey III brought discredit upon the Department as alleged. The Board finds   that a Chicago police officer being found guilty by a Circuit Court judge of Aggravated Assault   and Theft of Labor/Services clearly brings discredit upon the Chicago Police Department. That   “discredit upon the Department” is not undone by virtue of the fact that Detective Killackey   successfully completed the terms of his Court supervision, his protestations to the contrary   notwithstanding. The Board therefore finds that the Superintendent established that Detective   Killackey is guilty as charged.      11.  The Respondent, Detective John Killackey III, Star No. 20163, charged herein, is   guilty of violating, to wit:   Rule 6:  Disobedience of an order or directive, whether written or oral,     in that the Superintendent proved by a preponderance of the evidence the following charge:      On or about April 23, 2009, while off duty, Detective Killackey carried a firearm knowing  there was a likelihood that he would be consuming alcoholic beverages, in violation of General  Order 07-01, Section III-C (now known as Uniform and Property 04-02), thereby disobeying  an order or directive, whether written or oral.     The Respondent pled guilty to this charge.        12.  The Respondent, Detective John Killackey III, Star No. 20163, charged herein, is   guilty of violating, to wit:        8   Police Board Case No. 14 PB 2847  Detective John Killackey    His disregard for public safety, and his lack of judgment or inability to check his emotions raise                     significant concerns about the Respondent’s future performance in a job that requires one to make   split-second decisions affecting human life in difficult and dangerous situations, and are   incompatible with continued service as a law enforcement officer.  In addition, the fact that several   police officers responded to this incident involving a fellow police officer with a gun not only   adversely affects the morale of the police force but also brings disrepute on the Department.  Based   on the totality of the facts and circumstances of the Respondent’s conduct, returning him to duty,   armed and authorized to use deadly force, poses an unacceptable risk to the safety of the public and   would undermine the discipline of and public confidence in the Police Department.   The Board finds that the Respondent’s conduct is sufficiently serious to constitute a   substantial shortcoming that renders his continuance in his office detrimental to the discipline and   efficiency of the service of the Chicago Police Department, and is something that the law   recognizes as good cause for him to no longer occupy his office.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 390 feet of 8-inch and 702 feet of 12-inch water main in S.  Hillock Avenue, from S. Throop Street to S. Mary Street and S. Stark Street, from S. Hillock  Avenue to 380’ south of S. Hillock Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1873, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Thompson’s office, and he has made clear we are to put  great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the  whole term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                 Susan B. Anthony      •  Susan B. Anthony was fined $100 for trying to vote for President.  •  “Field and Stream” began publication.  •  San Francisco’s first cable car began service.  •  The first U.S. postal card was issued.  •  The first kindergarten public school opened in St. Louis.  •  P.T. Barnum’s circus, “The Greatest Show on Earth” made its debut in New York City.  •  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police was founded.                  HILLOCK AVE. & STARK ST. WATER PROJECT   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 390 feet of 8-inch and  702 feet of 12-inch water main in S. Hillock Avenue, from S. Throop Street to S. Mary Street  and S. Stark Street, from S. Hillock Avenue to 380’ south of S. Hillock Avenue.    Reason: The old main consists of a 6-inch pipe and we want to expand capacity. Further the old  pipe dates back to 1873 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main job to  be completed in mid October 2015. Restoration, which will be a joint effort between this  Department and CDOT, will follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors.  If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Hillock Avenue and S. Stark Street outside of our  working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of  safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal  plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

THOMPSON   773-254-6677                             FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in mid  October 2015. Restoration, which will be a joint effort between this Department and CDOT, will  follow. Dates may change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable  change, we will notify you.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1          When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

The Department of Water Management will soon install a new sewer in N. Wolcott Avenue,  from W. Addison Street to W. Bradley Place. The old pipe dates back to 1895 and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Pawar’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Thank you for your understanding and good will.     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc: Alderman Ameya Pawar       47th Ward        1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1       Do you wonder what was happening in 1895?  That’s the year the old sewer main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:           SHEMP HOWARD        The first professional football game was played.    Wilhelm Roentgen (Germany) discovered a form of radiation later known as X-rays.    Shemp Howard of The Three Stooges was born.    The term “Salisbury Steak” was used for the first time; the dish was named after Dr.   James Henry Salisbury, who advocated eating beef three times a day for health benefits.     The first female PhD (science) was earned by Caroline Willard Baldwin.    Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prize.    The world’s first movie theater opened in Paris, France.                                           PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing a new sewer in N.  Wolcott Avenue, from W. Addison Street to W. Bradley Place.     Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1895 and needs to be replaced. The area bounded by  Bradley on the north, Addison on the south, Lincoln on the east, and Damen on the west will  benefit from improved drainage and reduced risk of flooding.      Timing:  Work begins shortly, and we expect the job to be completed in January 2013. Full  restoration of the damaged streets/parkways will follow. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic and Parking:  We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work  hours (7am-4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that  cars be moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we  can, but since sewers run down the middle of the street, we may have closures to “through  traffic”. You will always have access to your home or business. Safety is always our first  consideration.                 CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN AMEYA PAWAR   773- 868-4747   info@chicago47.org      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        Will our sewer or water service be interrupted?  Neither should be.  But we can’t be  absolutely certain. Whenever you are doing heavy construction, there are bound to be surprises.   Sometimes we find a water service from a house well away from where our records indicate it is.   Sometimes, old pipes are brittle and prone to breaking when there is the vibration of digging.     Will I get notice if there is a shutdown?  We will try to give you notice prior to a shutdown.   But it all depends on the circumstances. If necessary, we will perform the emergency shutdown  immediately and then tell you about it.  Safety and avoiding property damage are prime  considerations.    What about restoration of curb and parkway damage?  When we finish the job, we will pave  the street and address curb and parkway issues.  We promise to leave your parkway and curb at  least as good as we found them.    What about improvements I’ve made in the parkway?  If there are ornamental plants,  brickwork, sprinkling systems, etc., in your parkway, we certainly try to avoid them.  The City of  Chicago, however, cannot assume responsibility for privately made improvements.  We will  work with you to avoid any problems along these lines.    Why should I be nice about this?  We are renewing your neighborhood and helping reduce the  risk of local flooding during heavy rain.  We intend to be good neighbors, although we are aware  that our work is inherently disruptive.  We will work with neighbors, Alderman Pawar, and  others, to ensure that this disruption is minimal and that the experience is as agreeable as  possible.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org,    call 311, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements    The Special Service Area # 47 of QCDC‘s management is responsible for the presentation  and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles  generally  accepted  the  design,  implementation,  and  maintenance  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error.    Auditors’ Responsibility    Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material  misstatement.    An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about  the amounts and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditors’  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  entity’s  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the  entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  significant  accounting  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation of the financial statements.         -1-   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our audit opinion.    The  accompany  financial  statements  were  presented  to  present  the  operation  of  Special  Service  Area  #47  of  QCDC  as  described  in  Note  1,  and  are  not  intended  to  present  the  financial position and change in net assets of Quad Communities Development Corporation.    Opinion    In  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  Special  Service  Area  #47  of  Quad  Communities  Development  Corporation  as  of  December  31,  2012  and  2011,  and  the  changes  in  its  net  assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.    Report on Supplementary Information    Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements  as a whole. The statements of revenues and expenditure -budget and actual are presented for  the  purpose  of  additional  analysis  and  are  not  a  required  part  of  the  financial  statements.  Such  information  is  the  responsibility  of  management  and  was  derived  from  and  relates  directly  to  the  underlying  accounting  and  other  records  used  to  prepare  the  financial  statements.  The  information  has  been  subjected  to  the  auditing  procedures  applied  in  the  audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and  reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to  prepare  the  financial  statements  or  to  the  financial  statements  themselves,  and  other  additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United  States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated in all material respects in  the relation to the financial statements as a whole. The accompanying summary schedules of  findings have not been audited by us and, accordingly, we express no opinion on them.

Infiltration Filter Strip: are vegetated areas intended to treat stormwater sheet flow from adjacent impervious areas. Filter strips function by slowing down runoff velocities, filtering out sediment and other pollutants, and provide infiltration to underlying soils.  Floor Area Bonus: the right to build a larger building in return for providing a public ame- nity.  The Chicago Zoning Ordinance provides floor area bonuses for additional river set- back area in the downtown zoning districts.  Mooring: a location where a boat may be tied up or anchored for a period of time, which may or may not include a dock for loading and unloading.  MWRD: the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, the public agency responsible for sewerage treatment and flood control in the Chicago Metropolitan area.  Park District hours: hours during which outdoor Chicago Park District facilities are open to the public, typically from 6:00 am to 11:00pm every day.  Planned development: a real estate parcel in the city of Chicago developed in accordance with the planned development provisions of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance (Municpal Code, Chapter 17-8).  Planned development ordinance: an amendment to the Chicago Zoning Ordinance govern- ing a particular planned development.  Planned developments are negotiated by the Chi- cago Department of Planning and Development, and approved by the Chicago Plan Com- mission and the Chicago City Council.  Public access easement: a legal instrument by which a riverside property owner conveys to a public entity or other entity the right to permit public access.  Public accessible: open to the public free of charge during park district hours.  Riparian zone: plantings that closely approximate that of a natural river edge, consisting of native plant species to serve as wildlife habitat.  Riverbank zone: the area adjacent to the river between the water’s edge and the top of bank (where there is a bank).  Where there is a vertical bulkhead or other engineered verti- cal structure, there is no riverbank zone.  See the “Setbacks” section for a definition of the water’s edge and the “top of bank.”  River Dependent Uses: those uses or activities that can be carried out only on, in, or adja- cent to a waterway because the use requires access to the waterway and which, therefore, cannot be located inland, including:  • • •  Bulk material operations that ship or receive materials by barge Marinas Recreational and commercial boating facilities  Appendix A: Definitions  • • • • •  Waterfront dock and port facilities Navigation aids, basins, and channels Bridge abutments Recreational parks and open spaces Other uses that require waterborne transportation or the river as a source of water  River Plan: Chicago River Corridor Development Plan, as adopted by the Chicago Plan Commission.  Riverwalk trail (multi-use path): continuous paved riverside shared use path intended for multiple recreation uses, including but not limited to walking, jogging, bicycling, and in-line skating.  Motorized use of the trail is not permited except by emergency vehicles.  Setback Zone: also called the urban greenway zone, extends from the top of bank to the development zone.  Setbacks are used to regulate and direct development to preserve or achieve a public good or benefit.  Setback variances: are permitted in the setback to accomodate irregular and constrained development sites. Variances require mitigation ration of 2.5:1 of additional open space adjacent to the.setback area.  Toe of bank: the area where the sloped riverbank meets the water line.  Top of bank (sloped bank): the point at the top of the slope at the water’s edge where the steepness of the slope becomes less than ten (10) percent.  Top of bank (vertical bulkhead): the point at the top of the bulkhead where a line be- tween other analogous points is located continuously over land and does not cross over the water.  Urban greenway zone: the area between the top of bank or face of vertical bulkhead and the setback line furthest from the river and top of bank.  Water’s edge: the high water level for a particular site or reach of the river.  APPENDIX B: DEVELOPMENT AREAS  TWO DEVELOPMENT AREAS ALONG THE CHICAGO RIVER  The character of the areas adjacent to the Chicago River differs depending whether the area is located within the urban core or within a residential neighborhood.  The riverfront areas in the urban core are generally formal in appearance and dominated by architectural elements.  The riverfront areas located in the residential neighborhoods are generally informal in appearance and are more likely to be dominated by vegetation.  Therefore, where appropriate, different site elements for areas depend upon whether they are located in the urban core or the residential neighborhoods.  Urban Core: This area is defined by North Avenue (north), Ashland Street (west), Cermak Street (south), and Lake Michigan (east).  Neighborhoods: The remainder of river sites not contained within the urban core are categorized as neighborhood sites.  These sites are north of North Avenue, west of Ashland Street, south of Cermak to the city limits.  Location of Urban Core and Neighborhood Areas Relative to the Nine Reaches of the Chicago River Corridor Development Plan  Appendix B: Development Area  APPENDIX C: SITE FURNISHINGS  BENCH  All benches should be 8 feet long with a center armrest.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 9,196 feet of 12-inch water main in W. Belmont Avenue, from  N. Narragansett Avenue to N. Laramie Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1917, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Reboyras’office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

WATER PROJECT               PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 9,196 feet of 12-inch  water main in W. Belmont Avenue, from N. Narragansett Avenue to N. Laramie Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1917 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main job to  be completed in late October 2015. This project is being coordinated with CDOT and their  department will complete all final restoration following water main construction.  Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. Belmont Avenue outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     ALDERMAN ARIEL REBOYRAS   773-794-3095   CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  October 2015. This project is being coordinated with CDOT and their department will complete  all final restoration following water main construction.   We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1         When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

Daley, Mayor          December 23, 2010   Chicago Department of Public Health  Bechara Choucair, MD, Commissioner   Figure 1. Weekly reported percent of emergency department visits  attributed to influenza-like illness in pediatric hospitals, hospitals  serving adults, and all hospitals overall, December 12-18, 2010.     What is the risk?    In Chicago, the risk of influenza infection remains low, however influenza-like illness (ILI) appears to be increasing.  Nationally,  ILI activity has increased and remains high in the Southeastern United States, which has accounted for 58% of all reported influ- enza viruses this season.  During surveillance week 50 of 2009 (December 13-19, 2009), 100% of all subtyped influenza A viruses  reported to CDC were 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viruses.  Currently, influenza A (H1N1) viruses account for approximately 5% of  subtyped influenza A viruses; with influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B viruses predominating this season.  Local data suggest a  similar pattern of activity, with a predominance of influenza A (H3N2) strains circulating.  Influenza activity usually peaks in  January or February and vaccination is the best way to protect against human influenza infection; all Chicagoans aged six months  and older are encouraged to get vaccinated. Vaccine is available in doctor’s offices, retail pharmacies, CDPH Neighborhood  Health Centers, and immunization walk-in clinics.  A list of CDPH clinics is available on the City of Chicago website1 and by  calling 311.     Are severe cases of influenza occurring?     No influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were re- ported for surveillance week 50 (December 12-18,  2010).  Cases meeting the current  influenza reporting  requirements2 should be reported to CDPH via  INEDSS3.      How much influenza-like illness is occurring?     For the week of December 12-18, 2010, with 17 hospi- tals reporting, 4.9% of emergency room visits were due  to ILI (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with cough or sore  throat).  In both pediatric hospitals, rates have increased  for the second consecutive week (Figure 1).   From De- cember 12-18, 2010,  with 10 Chicago ILINet outpatient  clinics reporting, 2.1% of doctor’s office visits were due  to ILI.  CDC uses data collected by ILINet to produce a  measure of ILI activity by state (Figure 2). Click on the  map for more information on each state’s activity lev- els.          Which influenza strains are circulating?     Data on influenza virus test results are reported by Chi- cago laboratories performing influenza subtyping. For  the week of December 12-18, 2010, with 6 laboratories  reporting, 6 of the 150 specimens tested were positive  for influenza.  Four specimens were subtyped as influ- enza A (H3N2); 1 was subtyped as influenza A (H1N1)  and 1 was subtyped as influenza B.      Where can I get more information?          The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Flu- View4 report provides national updates and trends re- lated to the intensity of influenza activity across the United States, as well as detailed information on antiviral resistance, severity  of illness, and other topics. Updates specific to Illinois5 and Suburban Cook County6 are also available online.     1http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/clinic/svcs/find_a_clinic.html;2 https://www.chicagohan.org/c/ document_library/get_file?p_l_id=28960&folderId=24344&name=DLFE-144.pdf; 3 https://www.idphnet.com; 4http://www.cdc.gov/ flu/weekly/; 5 http://www.idph.state.il.us/flu/fluupdate10-11.htm; 6 http://www.cookcountypublichealth.org/flu_current_situation   Figure 2. Influenza-like illness (ILI) activity* level by state, determined  using the proportion of doctor’s office visits due to ILI as reported  through ILINet, December 12-18, 2010.   * activity levels are compared to the average percent of ILI visits during the spring and fall weeks when little  or no influenza virus circulation is occurring.  Minimal activity corresponds to ILI activity below the average  and high activity corresponds to ILI activity much higher than the average.  Data is preliminary and may  change as more data is received.

By late April 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Reliable Contracting &  Equipment Company crews will begin the work to install 982 feet of new 24-inch and 65 feet of  new 36-inch water main in the intersection at S. Ashland Avenue and W. Harrison Street and W.  Harrison Street, from S. Morgan Street to S. Halsted Street.  The old water main dates back to 1878,  and needs to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  11th Ward Office:773-254-6677  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.     Sincerely,    Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

It also asks for appropriate  parties to testify concerning the use, effectiveness and cost of antimicrobial copper alloys as  compared to currently used hospital surfaces, so that a recommendation can be made with  respect to the use of antimicrobial copper alloys in appropriate locations in Chicago.   At the November 15, 2012 City Council meeting, an ordinance was introduced by the Mayor to  advance a contract for healthy vending machines across all City departments and buildings  starting in January 2013.  The resolution was referred to the Committee on Finance.  These new  vending machines will ensure that City employees and the visiting public are provided with  predominantly healthy snack and beverage options from vending machines in these buildings.   At the November 15, 2012 City Council meeting, an ordinance was introduced by 4th Ward  Alderman, William Burns and 12th Ward Alderman George Cardenas, banning the sale of  “Energy Drinks” to persons under the age 21.    The resolution was referred to the Committee  on Health and Environmental Protection.  “Energy Drinks” are defined as a canned or bottled  beverage which contains an amount of caffeine exceeding or equal to 180 milligrams per  container and containing Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) or Guarana.  The ordinance is  the result of a number of deaths possibility liked to consumption of these caffeinated drinks.   The Mayor introduced the City’s $8.3 billion budget at the October 10, City Council meeting.   The CDPH budget hearing was held on October 23, 2012. The City Council held a meeting on  November 8 which included a public budget hearing where interested parties and residents  were able to testify concerning the budget.  The budget was approved on November 15, 2012  by the full City Council with 46 aldermen voting yes, 3 no, and 1 absent.   Information on the  City’s budget plan can be located at the following link:   http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/obm.html    State   Upcoming Important Dates and Deadlines:     November 27 – 29, 2012 – First Week of Veto Session    December 4 – 6, 2012 – Second Week of Veto Session   Chicago Department of Public Health                          1      We anticipate that the General Assembly will meet shortly after the beginning of the new year  and before the next General Assembly is sworn in to address pension reform and possible  legislation gambling expansion in the State.     The recent election will result in the Democrats in the IL Senate and House having veto proof  majorities.  This mean that the General Assembly will be able approve legislation without fear  of a veto from the Governor.     Federal  Currently, the federal government is addressing issues surrounding the “fiscal cliff.”  The fiscal  cliff refers to the effect of a number of laws which if unchanged, could result in tax increases,  spending cuts, and a consequent reduction in the budget deficit beginning in 2013. These laws  include tax increases due to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and spending cuts under  the Budget Control Act of 2011.  The Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law on August  2, 2011.  The Act brought a short term resolution to the 2011 United States debt-ceiling crisis.   The Act also stated that if Congress did not create a deficit reduction bill with at least  $1.2 trillion in cuts, then Congress could issue a $1.2 trillion increase in the debt ceiling but this  would result in across-the-board cuts, also known as sequestrations.    These cuts would apply to mandatory and discretionary spending in the years 2013 to 2021.   According to the American Public Health Association, the sequestrations could take 2.4 billion  dollars from public health programs in 2013. In 2013, the budget cuts would mean an  automatic 8.4 Percent cut to program funding levels in 2013 for most nondefense discretionary  programs.  Those cuts mean a loss of $522 million for HRSA and a loss of $545 million for the  CDC in 2013.  Both parties are currently negotiating and most believe that a deal will be made,  even if it is a short term compromise, before the end of the year.  A long term deal will be more  likely to take place after Congress reconvenes on January 3, 2013.    POLICY REPORT     Illinois Names Eight Healthcare Plans to Care for Medicaid and Medicare Clients   The Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) has selected eight health plans to  serve clients in the Medicare-Medicaid Alignment Initiative (MMAI) and other initiatives in two  regions of the state. The health plans were selected based on their demonstrated ability to  offer a holistic approach to delivering coordinated care for clients eligible for both Medicare  and Medicaid (dual eligibles).  The initial awards are anticipated to extend for a maximum of  three years.  The MMAI is pending federal approval.  Enrollment in the MMAI program is  expected to start in the fall of 2013.       Eating at Home is the Healthier Option for Families  Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago found kids and teens children consumed an  extra 126 calories and adolescents took in 309 calories more each trip to a fast-food restaurant,  as opposed to home cooking, and eating at a full-service restaurant was linked to a 160 calorie  increase for kids and a 267 calorie increase for adolescents, compared with the times they ate  at their house.  Kids and adolescents were also shown to drink ""significantly higher"" amounts of   Chicago Department of Public Health                          2      soda on days they ate from restaurants, especially adolescents.  The authors note that over  time these extra calories add up and they are contributing to the ballooning childhood obesity  epidemic.  The study found that overall, the nation's youth take in higher amounts of sugar,  total fat, saturated fat and sodium when eating out at restaurants, compared to eating meals at  home.  The authors call for policies such as increasing costs of these purchases, limiting access  through zoning (such as around schools), limiting portion sizes, and curbing children's exposure  to restaurant and fast food marketing.  The study was published in the Archives of Pediatrics  and Adolescent Medicine and may be found at  http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1389390.    Cook County Board of Commissioners Approves a $1/pack Cigarette Tax Increase   This price increase is anticipated to prevent 18,000 young people from becoming smokers and  that without this measure, an estimated 2,700 of those young people would have developed  lung cancer during their lifetimes, and another 5,000 would have developed chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease.     Smoke-free Laws are Advancing Nationally  Comprehensive smoke-free laws are spreading across the U.S. with 30 cities (60%) having such  laws at the local level, state level, or both.  “The progress in extending comprehensive  secondhand smoke protections to the majority of the 50 largest U.S. cities reported in this  study is a major public health achievement,"" the study authors opined.  Yet, they also noted  that additional work remains to be done, in particular, a number of cities in the southern  United States have ineffective smoking restrictions or none at all.  If this gap in policy coverage  continues, it will only contribute to broader tobacco-related population disparities.

Smoking Bans Decrease the Number of Heart Attacks, Strokes and Respiratory Diseases such  as Asthma and Emphysema  Heart attack hospitalizations fell an average of 15% after communities passed laws banning  smoking in areas such as restaurants, bars and workplaces, according to the largest analysis of  smoke-free legislation to date. The analysis included 45 studies covering 33 laws in American  cities and states, as well as countries such as New Zealand and Germany.  Stroke  hospitalizations fell 16%, while hospitalizations for respiratory disease fell 24%.     Smoking bans also protect non-smokers, as cigarette smoke can trigger heart attacks in non- smokers with underlying heart disease.  Secondhand smoke affects a non-smoker's blood  vessels in as little as five minutes, causing changes that increase the risk of heart attack.   According to the National Cancer Institute, about 46,000 non-smoking Americans die from  secondhand smoke exposure each year.    Smoking bans also reduce health care costs for individuals, health plans and government  payers.  Total savings ranged from $302,000 in all health care costs in Starkville, Miss. to nearly  $7 million just in heart attack-related hospitalizations in Germany.
