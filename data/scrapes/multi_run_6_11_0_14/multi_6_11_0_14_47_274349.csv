Daley, Mayor   What is the risk?             January 29, 2010   Chicago Department of Public Health  Bechara Choucair, MD, Commissioner   As of January 29, 2010, the risk of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) influenza infection in Chicago is low. The num- bers of severe influenza infections, influenza-like illnesses, and positive influenza tests continue to decline.  Due to  the possibility of a recurrence of heightened activity in the coming months, all Chicagoans aged six months and  older are encouraged to protect themselves from infection by getting vaccinated with the pandemic influenza vac- cine. Chicagoans should ask their healthcare provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  For those without a  healthcare provider or whose healthcare providers do not have the pandemic vaccine, a schedule of City of Chicago  pandemic vaccine clinics is available online or by calling 311.    Are severe cases of influenza occurring?    Figure 1. Reported number of hospitalizations associated with  confirmed or presumptive pandemic influenza A (H1N1), Chicago,  by week of specimen collection, April 2009—January 23, 2010      No influenza A (H1N1)-associated hospitalizations  in Chicago residents have been reported for sur- veillance week 3 (January 17 –  23, 2010). This is  the eleventh consecutive week that a decline has  been noted (figure 1).          How much influenza-like illness is occurring?       With 20 Chicago hospitals reporting, 4.4% of       emergency department visits were due to influenza- like illness (i.e. fever of 100°F or greater, with  cough or sore throat).  Pediatric hospitals continue  to experience higher rates, but in hospitals serving  adults levels of activity are comparable to what was  reported in late September and early October, 2009  (figure 2).  Among ten outpatient clinics reporting  for the week of January 17 –  23, 2010, 2.3% of  doctor’s office visits were due to influenza-like  illness.  This level of activity is similar to levels  seen during the same surveillance week during  previous influenza seasons.   Figure 2. Weekly reported percent of emergency department visits  attributed to influenza-like illness in two Chicago pediatric hospitals,  and all Chicago hospitals serving adults (combined), August 30,  2009—January 23, 2010.      Which influenza strains are circulating?   For the week of January 17 –  23, 2010, with six  laboratories reporting, 6 influenza A-positive  specimens for which subtyping was performed  were reported as presumptive pandemic influenza  A (H1N1), 1 was reported as seasonal influenza A  (H3), and no influenza B strains were reported.   The seasonal influenza A(H3) strain was the first  of this subtype to be reported by one of the local  laboratories serving Chicago hospitals since Octo- ber of 2009.       Where can I get more information?        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s FluView2 report provides national updates and trends related to  the intensity of influenza activity across the United States, as well as detailed information on antiviral resistance,  severity of illness, and other topics. Updates specific to Illinois3 and Suburban Cook County4 are also available    online.   1http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_EDITORIAL/H1N1JanuarySchedule.pdf   2http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/; 3 http://www.idph.state.il.us/flu/fluupdate09-10.htm; 4 http://www.cookcountypublichealth.org/flu_current_situation

In early October, our private contractor will begin the work to install a new sewer in N.  Lincoln Avenue (Bryn Mawr-Rockwell), in N. Rockwell Street (Lincoln-Rascher), and in W.  Bryn Mawr Avenue (Rockwell-Artesian). The old sewer dates back to 1915 and needs to be  replaced.     When we are working in the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will  be left open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    40th Ward Office: 773-769-1140    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Randy Conner  Commissioner of Water Management

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 4,274 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Kildare Avenue (Irving  Park-Waveland), in W. Grace Street (Kostner-Kedvale), and in W. Waveland Avenue (Lowell- Kildare). The old pipe dates back to 1891, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Reboyras’ office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Ariel Reboyras               30th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                      Do you wonder what was happening in 1891?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                     Fig Newtons were produced for the first time.    The Wrigley Company was founded in Chicago, originally selling products such as soap   and baking powder.     Stanford University opened its doors.    Thomas Edison patented the radio.    Congress created the U.S.  Courts of Appeal.    Carnegie Hall in New York City opened.    George A. Hormel and Company introduced Spam.    James Naismith invented the game of basketball.                                         WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 4,274 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Kildare Avenue (Irving Park-Waveland), in W. Grace Street (Kostner- Kedvale), and in W. Waveland Avenue (Lowell-Kildare).     Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1891 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in June. Final restoration will follow in July. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN ARIEL REBOYRAS   773-794-3095                        FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in June. Final  restoration will follow in July. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

El 2 de diciembre de 2014, el Ayuntamiento de Chicago aprobó la ordenanza del Alcalde Rahm Emanuel un salario mínimo de $ 13 por hora en Chicago para 2019, un aumento de 45 por ciento sobre el actual salario mínimo. El salario mínimo aumenta gradualmente cada año a partir del 1 de julio de 2015. Todos los empleadores que operan dentro de la ciudad están sujetos al nuevo salario mínimo.  ¿Cuál es el horario de aumento de salario mínimo?    El aumento del salario mínimo será escalonado en una base anual cada 1 de julio a partir de 2015 - 2019  según al siguiente horario. A partir de 2020 y cada año posterior, el aumento del salario mínimo será  ligada a la tasa de inflación, pero no superará el 2,5 por ciento, y no habrá aumento al mínimo cuando la  tasa de desempleo en Chicago en el año anterior fue igual o mayor a 8.5 por ciento.  Fecha Efectiva  01 de julio de 2017 01 de julio de 2018 01 de julio de 2019 01 de julio de 2020  Empleados Sin Propina  Empleados Con Propina*  $11.00 $12.00 $13.00   $6.10  Cantidad que  se anunciará   anualmente antes   del 1 de junio  *Bajo la ley estatal y la ordenanza si los salarios de un empleado más las propinas no son iguales al salario mínimo  por semana el empleador debe compensar la diferencia  ¿Quién está cubierto bajo la ordenanza? •  Cualquier empleado que trabaje por lo menos dos horas mientras esté físicamente presente en la ciudad  dentro de un período de dos semanas califica para el salario mínimo requerido por la ordenanza. Esto  incluye a los empleados domésticos, trabajadores y trabajadores del cuidado de la salud en el hogar.  Un sindicato puede renunciar a los derechos de sus miembros de recibir como parte de un convenio  colectivo.   •  Los empleados no están obligados a proporcionar, y la Ciudad no solicitará información sobre la estado   de inmigración de cualquier persona que presente una queja. ¿Qué puedo hacer si creo que mi empleador le debe salarios? •  Puede presentar una queja contra su empleador ante la Ciudad de Chicago si cree que ha sido pagado  menos  que  el  salario  mínimo  requerido.  Los  empleados  pueden  presentar  una  reclamación  ante  la  Ciudad de Chicago llamando al 311 o presentando una declaración jurada de queja completa. Si BACP  prosigue con éxito su queja usted tiene derecho al pago completo de los salarios atrasados. Además,  los empleadores son potencialmente responsables a la Ciudad por multas entre $ 500 - $ 1,000 por  violación, así como por la suspensión de la licencia comercial o revocación.  •  BACP no actúa como abogado privado de ningún empleado. Un empleado tiene derecho a presentar  un acción en el Tribunal de Circuito del Condado de Cook contra su empleador si el empleado recibió  el salario mínimo exigido por la ley y tal empleado puede ser capaz de recuperar tres veces la cantidad  del pago insuficiente más los costos y honorarios razonables del abogado.  •  Las quejas deben presentarse dentro de un año después de que los salarios fueran debidos.   @ChicagoBACPCityofChicago.org/BACPDepartment of Business Affairs and Consumer ProtectionCity Hall, 121 North LaSalle Street, Rm 805 Chicago, IL 60602

Reyes, Commissioner   )          OPINION OF CHAIRMAN FLEMING    ORDER                         v.            Case No.  08 LA 47             This matter proceeded to hearing on an Amended Notice of Hearing advising the   Licensee that the City was instituting proceedings to revoke its City of Chicago Retail Liquor   License and all other City of Chicago licenses issued for the premises at 3049 N. Cicero.  The   charges were:    1.   2.   3.   4.      That on August 30, 2007, the licensee, by and through its agent, sold,  offered for sale, kept for sale, or exposed for sale alcoholic liquor at retail  without having a valid City of Chicago retail liquor license, in violation of  Title 4, Chapter 60, Section 020(a), Municipal Code of Chicago.    That on August 30, 2007, the licensee, by and through its agent, failed to  display a valid retail liquor license in a conspicuous place on the licensed  premises, in violation of Title 4, Chapter 4, Section 210, Municipal Code  of Chicago.    That on August 30, 2007, the licensee, by and through its agent,  maintained a sign over the public way without a valid permit, in violation  of Title 10, Chapter 28, Section 075 (g), Municipal Code of Chicago.    That on August 30, 2007, the licensee, by and through its agent,               1                    maintained a canopy which extended over the public way without the  required permit, in violation of Title 10, Chapter 28, Section 200,  Municipal Code of Chicago.      The Deputy Hearing Commissioner entered Findings of Fact that the City met its burden       of proof on Charges 1, 2, 3 and 4 and, based on the present violations and the Licensee=s prior   disciplinary history, found that a 21 day suspension was the appropriate penalty.       Since this is a review of a suspension the scope of review is limited to these three   questions:          (a)   Whether the local liquor control commissioner has proceeded in the   manner provided by law;    (b)  Whether the order is supported by the findings;    (c)  Whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in light of the   whole record.         There was substantial evidence in the record as a whole to affirm the findings on Counts    2, 3 and 4.  The liquor license did not issue until October 1, 2007, and the canopy and sign   permits were not resolved until September 13, 2007.      Counsel for licensee argues that there are due process implications with respect to the   liquor license since the license was paid for on August 14, 2007, which was the day before the   expiration of the current license.  The problem with that argument is that the evidence is that   there were two holds on the license on August 14, 2007.  Liquor licenses will not be issued until   the holds are resolved. Whether the holds were legitimate or were placed in error on this license                          2   is not an issue before this Commission.      This Commissioner does not feel that there is sufficient evidence in the record as a whole   to affirm the finding on Count 1.  The only evidence on this issue was the testimony of Nikita   Sanders.  She is a Revenue Investigator II who was at the premises on August 30, 2007, to do a   follow-up investigation of the sign and canopy permits.  She saw the bar open and a bartender   but could not recall if there were any patrons inside.  There was no evidence of a sale of alcohol   or even the presence of inventory of alcohol that would be considered proof of keeping or   exposing for sale alcoholic liquor.       There is sufficient evidence in the record as a whole to support the findings on Charges 3   and 4 that respondent maintained a unlicensed sign and canopy.  The issue on these two counts is   whether such violations can be bases to suspend a liquor license.  While the Mayor as Local   Liquor Control Commissioner can revoke or suspend for violation of any city ordinance the   counts require a reasonable constitution of that power and its application is limited to violations   of statutes, ordinances or regulations that are fairly related to the control of liquor.  Askew v.   Daley 62 Ill.App.3d 370. These ordinances are not fairly related to the control of liquor and   violations of these ordinances cannot be a basis for suspension of the liquor license.       The final issue to be decided is whether the 21 day suspension should be upheld in light   of the previous findings.  The Findings of Fact of the Deputy Hearing Commissioner does not   state if the 21 day suspension was based on the totality of the findings or was concurrent on each                          3   of the findings.  Since this Commission does not have the power to remand for clarification on   this point, this Commissioner takes the position that the 21 day suspension was concurrent on all   charges.  With that presumption it must be decided if the 21 day suspension for failure to display   a valid retail liquor license is so arbitrary and capricious as to require reversal.  While this   Commissioner would not have recommended that long of a suspension based on the past history,   the 21 day suspension is not so arbitrary or capricious as to require reversal of the entire   suspension.        OPINION OF COMMISSIONER KOPPEL    I concur with Chairman Fleming=s opinion.       OPINION OF COMMISSIONER SCHNORF    I have reviewed Chairman Fleming=s opinion and agree with him on his findings on   Counts 1, 3 and 4.  I also agree that the violations in Counts 3 and 4 are not so fairly related to   the control of liquor that they can serve as a bases for suspension of the liquor license.       I respectfully disagree with the Chairman=s finding on Count 2.  Since there is   insufficient evidence to support the charge that the respondent sold or offered for sale alcoholic   liquor at retail as alleged in Count 1, there is no reason that the licensee needed to display a valid   retail liquor license on August 30, 2007.  Since there is insufficient evidence in the record as a   whole to support the findings in Charges 1 and 2 and since the violations in Charges 3 and 4   cannot be used to suspend this liquor license, I would reverse the 21 day suspension.                           4                                                                                              IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED That the order suspending the liquor                      5   license of the appellant for TWENTY-ONE (21) days is AFFIRMED.     Pursuant to Section 154 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, a Petition for Rehearing may be filed with this  Commission within TWENTY (20) days after service of this order.  The date of the mailing of this order  is deemed to be the date of service.  If any party wishes to pursue an administrative review action in the  Circuit Court the Petition for Rehearing must be filed with this Commission within TWENTY (20) days  after service of this order as such petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administrative review.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 928 feet of 8-inch water main in W. 68th Street, from S.  Hamilton Avenue to S. Damen Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1890, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Foulkes’ office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,     Thomas H. Powers, P.E.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       CY YOUNG IN ACTION      Idaho and Wyoming became states.     The first U.S. college-level dairy school opened at the University of Wisconsin.     W.B. Purvis patented the fountain pen.      Congress created the Weather Bureau.    Rubber gloves were used in surgery for the first time.     X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen.    Cy Young pitched and won his first major league baseball game.    The literacy rate in the United States was estimated at 13.5%.    Rose Kennedy, Colonel Sanders, Groucho Marx, and Dwight D. Eisenhower were born.                              68TH ST. WATER PROJECT        PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 928 feet of 8-inch water  main in W. 68th Street, from S. Hamilton Avenue to S. Damen Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1890 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late August 2012. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on W. 68th Street outside of our working hours.  When we  are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be  able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of  working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.                    CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN TONI FOULKES   773- 863-0220   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late August 2012.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
