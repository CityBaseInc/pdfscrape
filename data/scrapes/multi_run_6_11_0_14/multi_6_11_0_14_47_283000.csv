You stated that [your  department head]  had requested that you contact the  Board to  review your  outside employment situation under the City's Governmental Ethics Ordinance.  On March 10,2005, Board staff met with you to  discuss your situation. Our  analysis and conclusions in this matter are set forth below at page four of this  letter.   Statement of the Facts.  During your March 10, 2005  meeting with Board  staff,  you  stated  the  following  with  regard  to  your  City  and  outside  employment:   City  Employment.  You have been employed as a motor truck driver in City  . Department A]  since 1998. (You were previously employed by the City from  . [DATE] to [DATE].)  For approximately the last two and a half years, you have  been,assigned to  [a particular division of Department A].  You currently are  assigned to [the day shift]. Depending upon the season, you operate one of two  City vehicles:  [  ] You also are responsible for performing  certain minor maintenance of the vehicle(s) you operate.  In the winter, you  work out of a City garage located at [  ]  during the other seasons,  you  work in one of five  different City wards.  In your City job, you do  not  supervise anyone; you report to either of two motor truck driver foremen. You  have no occasion to interact with City contractors or subcontractors in your City  job.  You  have  no  involvement  in  the  award,  negotiation,  execution  or  performance of any City contracts.  Specifically, as to the City's Hired Truck(cid:173) Program, you currently have no involvement of any kind in any aspect of that  program.  (Your only  involvement previously in any  aspect of that program  consisted of ""off-loading"" debris from your City truck to a truck owned and/or  operated  by  a  Hired  Truck  contractor  or  subcontractor.  Since  last  year,  Department drivers dump debris into ""drop boxes"" owned and operated by a  City contractor, [   ].)   1'41+   Case No.  05011.Q  March 17,2005  Page 2   ]  ,  are  co-owners  of  Outside  Employment.  You  and  your  wife,  [  [Trucking Company]  (""Company"").  You incorporated the business with the State of Illinois in [  DATE]. Your wife served as president of [Company]  for the first year after its incorporation. Since  [DATE  ], you  have  served  as  president  and  your  wife,  as  secretary.  (Before  [Company's]  incorporation, your wife served as  ""president"" of [Company]  when it was a sole proprietorship).  [Company's] City business license is currently expired; you are in the process of renewing it. You  and your wife have four sons, the oldest of whom is eighteen.  None of your children is employed  by [Company]. Your home address serves as  [Company's]  business mailing address.  [Company]  transports [product]. [Company]  currently owns or leases five ""tractor"" vehicles. The vehicles are  housed at a garage located at  [Address].  [Company]  leases the garage from  [Name] , a private  citizen. In addition to you, [Company] currently employs two other drivers, neither of whom is a City  employee. The only restriction or limitation to which your Illinois driver's license is currently subject  is a requirement that you wear corrective lenses while operating a motor vehicle.   [Company]  currently  has  transport  contracts  with  three  privately-owned  entities:  [Entity  One,  Address]  ,  [Entity Two,  Address]  and  [ Entity Three,""Address ].  [Company]  entered into these  contracts  in  or  around  April  2004,  August  2004  and  March  2005,  respectively.  You  have  no  involvement of any kind in your City job with any of these three entities. Furthermore, to the best  of your knowledge, none  of these three  entities is  a  City  contractor or subcontractor.  Much of  [Company's]  work on behalf of these entities  involves picking up  [product]  from,  or delivering  [product] to, railroad yards within the City of Chicago. [Company] also transports [product] to/from  other areas within Illinois, as well as Wisconsin, Indiana and Iowa. To the best of your knowledge,  none of the pick-up or delivery sites is owned or operated by the City of Chicago.   [Company]  has  never  had,  and  is  not  currently  seeking,  contracts  or  subcontracts  with  any  governmental unit, including the City of Chicago.  However, [Company] has applied to the City of  Chicago's Procurement  Office  for  MBEIWBEIDBE  certification.  [Company's]  application was  denied by the City in [YEAR].  [Company]'intends to submit anew application for certification in  the  very  near  future.  If accorded  such  status,  [Company]  does  not  intend  to  seek  contracts  or  subcontracts with the City of Chicago; however, [Company]  does intend to seek contracts with other  governmental units, including the State of Illinois and the Federal government.   On or about February 3, 2005, you requested that [your department head] reassign you from your  current shift ([the day shift]  to the [night shift]. You have requested this shift change, you explained,  in order to be available during the day to run and develop [Company's]  business (which you hope  will one day provide a source of employment for your four sons ).  Your request to change shifts is  currently pending with [your department head]. In connection with his review of that request, [your  department head] requested that you contact the Board to review your outside employment situation  under the Governmental Ethics Ordinance. You have authorized Board staff to forward a copy of  staff s opinion letter in this matter  to  [your department head].   Case No. 050 II.Q  March 17,2005  Page 3   Relevant City Laws and Rules. Neither the City's Governmental Ethics Ordinance (Chapter 2-156  of the  Municipal  Code)  nor the  City's  Personnel  Rules per se  prohibits  a  City  employee  from  engaging  in  outside  employment  or  having  outside  business  interests.  However,  both  the  Governmental Ethics Ordinance and the Personnel Rules impose restrictions on City employees who  have employment or business interests outside of City government.   Personnel  Rules.  City  Personnel  Rule  XX,  Section  3,  directly  addresses  the  issue  of outside  employment.  That Rule gives City department heads authority to "" ... either approve or disapprove""  any employee's request to engage in outside employment.  That same Rule also mandates that:   I.   2.  3.   4.   5.   ""[any outside employment] shall not interfere with the efficient performance of the  employee's duties"";  ""[any outside employment] shall not involve a conflict of interest"";  ""[any outside employment] shall not occur during the employee's regular or assigned  working hours"";  ""no employee granted permission to engage in outside employment shall work at said  outside employment for a longer period oftime than stated in his or her request for  permission ... ""; and  ""any employee  accepting  outside employment shall  make  arrangements  with the  outside  employer  to  be  relieved  from  his  or  her  duties  if and  when  called  for  emergency service by the City.""   Governmental Ethics Ordinance Provisions.  The following provisions of the Governmental Ethics  Ordinance are most directly relevant to the issue of your outside employmentlbusiness interests:   Sections 2-156-020 (Fiduciary Duty) and2-156-060 (City-Owned Property) obligate  you,  as  a  City  employee,  to  always  act  in  the  best  interest  of the  City  in  the  performance of your City duties and prohibit you from using City property, including  City time, City equipment or your City job title/position for non-City purposes.   Section 2-156-030 (Improper Influence) and Section 2-156-080 (Conflicts ofInterest)  prohibit  you,  as  a  City  employee,  from  making,  participating  in  making,  or  attempting to influence any City governmental decision with respect to your outside  employment or business interests.   Section 2-156-11 0 (Interest in City Business) prohibits you, as a City employee, from  having a ""financial interest"" in your own name or in the name of any other person in  any contract or work of the City.  ""Financial interest"" is defined in relevant part as:  (1)  any  interest as  a result of which the  owner currently receives  or is  entitled to  receive in the future  more than $2,500 per year;  or (2)  any  interest with a cost or  present value of $5,000 or more.   Case No. 05011.Q  March 17, 2005  Page 4   Section 2-156-111  (Prohibited Conduct) prohibits you, as a City employee, or your  spouse or any entity  in which either of you has a financial interest from soliciting,  applying for or receiving a loan from any person doing, or seeking to do,  business  with the City.   Section  2-156-050  (Money  for  Advice)  prohibits  you,  as  a  City  employee,  from  soliciting or accepting money, or any other thing of value, in return for  advice or  assistance on matters concerning the operation or business of the City, unless it is  wholly unrelated to your City duties and responsibilities.   Section  2-156-070  (Use  of Confidential  Information)  prohibits  you,  as  a  City  employee,  from  using or revealing confidential information gained during,  or by  reason of, your City employment.   Section  2-156-090  (Representation  of Other  Persons)  prohibits  you,  as  a  City  employee, from representing your outside employer or business in any proceeding or  transaction before any City agency. The term ""represent"" has been interpreted by the  Board to include the following: making personal appearances before City agencies  on behalf of others; making telephone contact with  City employees or officials on  behalf of others;  signing or submitting proposals, contracts or other documents to  City agencies; making contact with employees or officials on behalf of others; as well  as acting as a spokesperson for another or seeking to communicate and promote the  interests of one party to another.   Company   Analysis  and  Conclusions.  Based on the  facts  you presented,  surnrnarized above,  Board staff  concludes that neither your current ownership of,  nor employment with,  [  ]  violates  the  City's  Governrnental  Ethics  Ordinance.  However,  staffs opinion  is  limited  to  the  application of the City's Governrnental Ethics Ordinance to  the facts recited in this letter.  Staffs  opinion is not dispositive of all issues relevant to your situation.  You have requested that [ your  department]  reassign you from  [ the day  shift to  the night shift].  You have requested this  shift  change, you explained,  in order to be available during the day to  run and develop  [Company's]  business.  Under  Personnel  Rule  XX,  the  decision  to  grant  or deny  your request  is  at  the  sole  discretion of [your department head].  In making that decision, [your department head] must apply(cid:173) the criteria established in Rule XX (set forth above on page three of this letter) and conclude, among  other things,  that your outside employment will not ""interfere with the efficient performance of  [your] City duties""; that your outside employment will not ""involve a conflict of interest""; that your  outside employment ""will not occur during [your] regular or assigned working hours""; and that you  have made arrangements to relieve yourself of your outside employment duties ""if and when [you  are] called for emergency service by the City."" Furthermore, in making his decision on your request,  [your department head]  should consider the potential for any  appearance of impropriety,  e.g,  an  appearance  that  approval  of  your  shift-change  request  would  effectively  render  your  City  employment secondary to the development of your private business interests.   Case No.  05011.Q  March 17,  2005  Page 5   Finally, please note that staff s opinion is based solely on the application of the City's Governmental   Ethics  Ordinance to the facts  stated in this letter.  If the facts  stated are  incorrect or incomplete,   please notifY us immediately, as any change may alter our opinion.  We appreciate your inquiry and   your concern to abide by the standards embodied in the Governmental Ethics Ordinance.

Indicator Description   This indicator describes trends in the magnitude and timing of streamflow in rivers and streams across  the United States. Streamflow is a useful indicator of climate change for several reasons. More  precipitation is expected to cause higher average streamflow in some places, while heavier storms could  lead to higher peak flows. More frequent or severe droughts may reduce streamflow in some areas.  Changes in the amount of snowpack and earlier spring melting can alter the size and timing of peak  streamflows.    Components of this indicator include trends in four annual flow statistics from 1940 through 2014:     •  Magnitude of annual seven-day low streamflow (Figure 1).  •  Magnitude of annual three-day high streamflow (Figure 2).  •  Magnitude of annual mean streamflow (Figure 3).  •  Timing of winter-spring center-of-volume date (Figure 4).     2.  Revision History   Indicator published.  Updated indicator with data through 2012. Added Figure 3 to show annual  mean streamflow and renumbered original Figure 3 (winter-spring center of  volume) as Figure 4.  Updated indicator with data through 2014.   December 2012:   May 2014:    August 2016:    Data Sources   3.  Data Sources   Mike Kolian of EPA developed this indicator in partnership with Michael McHale, Robert Dudley, and  Glenn Hodgkins at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The indicator is based on streamflow data from a  set of reference stream gauges specified in the Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow  (GAGES-II) database, which was developed by USGS and is described in Lins (2012). Daily mean  streamflow data are stored in the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS).    4.  Data Availability   EPA obtained the data for this indicator from Michael McHale, Robert Dudley, and Glenn Hodgkins at  USGS. Similar streamflow analyses had been previously published in the peer-reviewed literature (Burns  et al., 2007; Hodgkins and Dudley, 2006). USGS provided a reprocessed data set to include streamflow  trends through water year 2014.     Technical Documentation: Streamflow   1   Streamflow data from individual stations are publicly available online through the surface water section  of NWIS at: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw. Reference status and watershed, site characteristics,  and other metadata for each stream gauge in the GAGES-II database are available online at:  http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/gagesII_Sept2011.xml.    Methodology   5.  Data Collection   Streamflow is determined from data collected at stream gauging stations by automated devices that  record the elevation (or stage) of a river or stream at regular intervals each day. Intervals vary from  station to station—typically every 15 minutes to one hour. USGS maintains a national network of stream  gauging stations, including more than 7,000 stations currently in operation throughout the United States  (http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1995/0066/report.pdf). USGS has been collecting stream gauge data since the  late 1800s at some locations. Gauges generally are sited to record flows for specific management goals  or legal mandates, typically in cooperation with municipal, state, and federal agencies.    Streamflow (or discharge) is measured manually at regular intervals by USGS personnel (typically every  four to eight weeks). The relation between stream stage and discharge is determined, and a stage- discharge relation (rating) is developed to calculate streamflow for each recorded stream stage (Rantz et  al., 1982). These data are used to calculate the daily mean discharge for each day at each site. All  measurements are made according to standard USGS procedures (Rantz et al., 1982; Sauer and  Turnipseed, 2010; Turnipseed and Sauer, 2010).     This indicator uses data from USGS stream gauges that are part of the Hydro-Climatic Data Network  2009 (HCDN-2009) network (Lins, 2012), which is a subset of the USGS GAGES-II network. HCDN-2009  gauges have been carefully selected to reflect minimal interference from human activities such as dam  construction, reservoir management, wastewater treatment discharge, water withdrawal, and changes  in land cover and land use that might influence runoff. The subset of HCDN-2009 gauges was further  examined on the basis of length of period of record (75 years) and completeness of record (greater than  or equal to 80 percent for every decade). Figures 1, 2, and 3 are based on data from 192 stream gauges.  Figure 4 relies on 56 stream gauges largely because it is limited to stream basins that receive 30 percent  or more of their total annual precipitation in the form of snow. This additional criterion was applied  because the metric in Figure 4 is used primarily to examine the timing of winter-spring runoff, which is  substantially affected by snowmelt-related runoff in areas with a large annual snowpack. All of the  selected stations and their corresponding basins are relatively independent—that is, the analysis does  not include stations with watershed areas that overlap by more than 30 percent.    All watershed characteristics, including basin area, station latitude and longitude, and percentage of  precipitation as snow were taken from the GAGES-II database. GAGES-II basin area was determined  through EPA’s National Hydrography Dataset Plus and supplemented by the USGS National Water- Quality Assessment Program and the USGS Elevation Derivatives for National Applications.     Technical Documentation: Streamflow   2   6.   Indicator Derivation   Figures 1, 2, and 3. Seven-Day Low (Figure 1), Three-Day High (Figure 2), and Annual Average (Figure 3)  Streamflow in the United States, 1940–2014     Figure 1 shows trends in low-flow conditions using seven-day low streamflow, which is the lowest  average of seven consecutive days of streamflow in a year. Hydrologists commonly use this measure  because it reflects sustained dry or frozen conditions that result in the lowest flows of the year. Seven- day low flow can equal zero if a stream has dried up completely.    Figure 2 shows trends in very wet conditions using three-day high streamflow, which is the highest  average of three consecutive days of streamflow in a year. Hydrologists use this measure because a  three-day averaging period has been shown to effectively characterize runoff associated with large  storms and peak snowmelt over a diverse range of watershed areas.    Figure 3 shows trends in average conditions using annual average streamflow, which is the average of all  daily mean streamflow values for a given year.    Rates of change from 1940 to 2014 at each station on the maps in Figures 1–3 were computed using the  Sen slope, which is the median of all possible pair-wise slopes in a temporal data set (Helsel and Hirsch,  2002). The Sen slope was then multiplied by the number of years in the period (74 years: the last year  minus the starting year) to estimate total change over time. Trends are reported as percentage  increases or decreases, computed from the value for the last year of the regression line relative to the  value of the first year of the regression line.    Figure 4. Timing of Winter-Spring Runoff in the United States, 1940–2014     Figure 4 shows trends in the timing of streamflow in the winter and spring, which is influenced by the  timing of snowmelt runoff in areas with substantial annual snowpack. The timing of streamflow also can  be influenced by the ratio of winter rain to snow and by changes in the seasonal distribution of  precipitation. Figure 4 shows trends in the winter-spring center-of-volume (WSCV) date, which is  defined for this indicator as the date when half of the total streamflow between January 1 and July 31  for sites in the western United States, or half of the total streamflow between January 1 and May 31 for  sites in the eastern United States, has passed by the gauging station. These regionally different time  periods were selected to best represent the period during which snowmelt occurs in each region, based  on snowmelt-related streamflow interpreted from long-term average seasonal hydrographs. Trends in  this date are computed in the same manner as the other three components of this indicator, and the  results are reported in terms of the number of days earlier or later that the WSCV date is occurring. For  more information about WSCV-date methods, see Hodgkins and Dudley (2006) and Burns et al. (2007).    Indicator Development    For the 2016 update to this indicator, EPA and USGS adjusted the analysis in two ways:     •  The analysis of all four metrics changed from calendar years (January 1 to December 31) to   water years (October 1 to September 30). Water years are defined such that “water year 2014”  runs from October 2013 through September 2014.   Technical Documentation: Streamflow   3   •  The seasonal window for the timing of winter-spring flows changed from January through June  for all gauges to January through July for western gages and January through May for eastern  gauges.    EPA and USGS made these adjustments to harmonize this indicator with other publications based on the  same data and to reflect best practices for characterizing WSCV.    7.  Quality Assurance and Quality Control   Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures are documented for measuring stream stage  (Sauer and Turnipseed, 2010), measuring stream discharge (Turnipseed and Sauer, 2010), and  computing stream discharge (Sauer, 2002; Rantz et al., 1982). Stream discharge is typically measured  and equipment is inspected at each gauging station every four to eight weeks. The relation between  stream stage and stream discharge is evaluated following each discharge measurement at each site, and  shifts to the relation are made if necessary.    The GAGES-II database incorporated a QC procedure for delineating the watershed boundaries acquired  from the National Hydrography Dataset Plus. The data set was cross-checked against information from  USGS’s National Water-Quality Assessment Program. Basin boundaries that were inconsistent across  sources were visually compared and manually delineated based on geographical information provided in  USGS’s Elevation Derivatives for National Applications. Other screening and data quality issues are  addressed in the GAGES-II metadata available at:  https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/gagesII_Sept2011.xml.    Analysis   8.  Comparability Over Time and Space   All USGS streamflow data have been collected and extensively quality-assured by USGS since the start of  data collection. Consistent and well-documented procedures have been used for the entire periods of  recorded streamflows at all gauges (Corbett et al., 1943; Rantz et al., 1982; Sauer, 2002).    Trends in streamflow over time can be strongly influenced by human activities upstream, such as the  construction and operation of dams, flow diversions and abstractions, and land-use change. To remove  these non-climatic influences to the extent possible, this indicator relies on a set of reference gauges  that were chosen because they represent least-disturbed (though not necessarily completely  undisturbed) watersheds. The criteria for selecting reference gauges vary from region to region based  on land use characteristics. Therefore, a modestly impacted watershed in one part of the country (e.g.,  an area with agricultural land use) might not have met the data quality standards for another less  impacted region. The reference gauge screening process is described in Lins (2012) and is available in  the GAGES-II metadata at: https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/gagesII_Sept2011.xml.    Analytical methods have been applied consistently over time and space.     Technical Documentation: Streamflow   4   9.  Data Limitations   Factors that may impact the confidence, application, or conclusions drawn from this indicator are as  follows:     1.  This analysis is restricted to locations where streamflow is not highly disturbed by human   influences, including reservoir regulation, diversions, and land cover change. Changes in land  cover and land use over time, however, could still influence trends in the magnitude and timing  of streamflow at some sites.   2.  Reference gauges used for this indicator are not evenly distributed throughout the United   States, nor are they evenly distributed with respect to topography, geology, elevation, or land  cover, due to variations in the availability of long-term data.   3.  Some streams in northern or mountainous areas have their lowest flows in the winter due to  water being held in snow or ice for extended periods. At these sites, low flow trends could be  influenced by climate factors other than reduced precipitation or otherwise dry conditions, such  as long stretches of cold weather.     10.  Sources of Uncertainty   Uncertainty estimates are not available for this indicator as a whole. As for the underlying data, the  precision of individual stream gauges varies from site to site. Accuracy depends primarily on the stability  of the stage-discharge relationship, the frequency and reliability of stage and discharge measurements,  and the presence of special conditions such as ice (Novak, 1985). USGS has published a general online  reference devoted to the calculation of error in individual stream discharge measurements (Sauer and  Meyer, 1992).    11.  Sources of Variability   Streamflow can be highly variable over time, depending on the size of the watershed and the factors  that influence flow at a gauge. USGS addresses this variability by recording stream stage many times a  day (typically 15-minute to one-hour intervals) and then computing a daily average streamflow.  Streamflow also varies from year to year as a result of variation in precipitation and air temperature.  Trend magnitudes computed from Sen slopes provide a robust estimate of linear changes over a period  of record, and thus this indicator does not measure decadal cycles or interannual variability in the metric  over the time period examined.     While gauges are chosen to represent drainage basins relatively unimpacted by human disturbance,  some sites may be more affected by direct human influences (such as land-cover and land-use change)  than others. Other sources of variability include localized factors such as topography, geology, elevation,  and natural land cover. Changes in land cover and land use over time can contribute to streamflow  trends, though careful selection of reference gauges strives to minimize these impacts.    Although the WSCV date is driven by the timing of the bulk of snow melt in areas with substantial annual  snowpack, other factors also will influence the WSCV date. For instance, a heavy rain event in the winter  could result in large volumes of water that shift the timing of the center of volume earlier. Changes over   Technical Documentation: Streamflow   5   time in the distribution of rainfall during the WSCV measurement period could also affect the WSCV  date.    12.  Statistical/Trend Analysis   The maps in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 all show trends through time that have been computed for each  gauging station using a Sen slope analysis by USGS. Because of uncertainties and complexities in the  interpretation of statistical significance, particularly related to the issue of long-term persistence (Cohn  and Lins, 2005; Koutsoyiannis and Montanari, 2007), significance of trends is not reported. Future  updates of this indicator will likely also include details on the significance of the reported trends.    References   Burns, D.A., J. Klaus, and M.R. McHale. 2007.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,000 feet of new 8-inch water main in S. Ridgeland Avenue,  from E. 79th Street to South Chicago Avenue.  The old pipe dates back to 1910, and needs to be  replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Harris’ office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.

That’s the year the old water main was  installed beneath your street. Among other things:           MOTHER TERESA        Mother Teresa was born.    Comiskey Park, Home of the Chicago White Sox, opened.    Father’s Day was celebrated for the first time.    The Hallmark Cards company was founded.    The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated and chartered.    The first radio contest was held, in Philadelphia.    Alva Fisher patented the electric washing machine.                                                   PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,000 feet of new 8-inch  water main in S. Ridgeland Avenue, from E. 79th Street to South Chicago Avenue.      Reason:  The old main dates back to 1910 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late December. Restoration will follow in late May 2014. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN MICHELLE HARRIS   773-874-3300      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late December.  Restoration will follow in late May 2014. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we  are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old water main to the new water main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice  when this is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will  break.  They can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will  let you know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.              Save Water Save Money!

Want to learn more?  http://www.cityofchicago.org/watermanagement/bfp                D E P A R T M E N T   O F  W A T E R   M A N A G E M E N T       C I T Y   O F   C H I C A G O  What is MeterSave?    MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 4,394 feet of 8-inch and 2,634 feet of 12-inch water main in N.  Cicero Avenue, from W. Division Street to W. Chicago Avenue, W. Rice Street, from N.  Laverne Avenue to N. Kilpatrick Avenue and W. Walton Street, from N. Cicero Avenue to 450’  East of N. Kilpatrick Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1896, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Ervin’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Jason C.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                          •  German physicist Wilhelm Rontgen announced his discovery of x-rays.  •  The Tootsie Roll was introduced.  •  The first movie theater opened, charging ten cents for admission.  •  The modern Olympic Games began in Athens, Greece.  •  The first car accident occurred, when Henry Wells hit a bicyclist in New York City.  •  Yosemite became a national park.  •  ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" was written by John Philip Sousa.                               CICERO AVE., RICE ST. & WALTON ST. WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 4,394 feet of 8-inch and  2,634 feet of 12-inch water main in N. Cicero Avenue, from W. Division Street to W. Chicago  Avenue, W. Rice Street, from N. Laverne Avenue to N. Kilpatrick Avenue and W. Walton  Street, from N. Cicero Avenue to 450’ East of N. Kilpatrick Avenue.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1896 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the water main job to  be completed in late January 2015. Final restoration, which will be a joint effort between this  department and CDOT, will follow in spring 2015. Dates may change depending on weather and  other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Cicero Avenue, W. Rice Street and W. Walton  Street outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to  traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it  means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local  traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1                CONTACT NUMBERS   ALDERMAN JASON C. ERVIN   773-533-0900   http://www.AldermanErvin.com/                             FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  .    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the water main job is slated to conclude in late  January 2015. Final restoration, which will be a joint effort between this department and CDOT,  will follow in spring 2015.  We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.             DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.

Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
