Information needed for next meeting:   Street outreach providers and Franciscan Outreach soup kitchen will identify the locations, and number of people regularly at each location, for the next meeting the week of June 21st   DFSS will reach out to Franciscan, REST, and San Jose Obrero to discuss  potential inclusion in the Registry Week, including survey times and volunteers needed beyond staff   Khen Nickele of the Division of Mental Health and Paul Mireles of Thresholds will determine the average number of homeless who frequent Stroger and Sinai hospitals under their targeted outreach  Review of Vulnerability Index – Initial discussion of allowed changes:   # 16 “Where did you live before becoming homeless: Include specific to regions  of city of Chicago, downstate Illinois, suburbs   #17 “Where do you go when you don’t feel well”: list specific hospitals and  community clinics;  o Need clarification from Common Ground “when you’re not feeling well”  includes mental as well as physical;   Additional question ideas:  o Prior to becoming homeless, were you living alone or with others? o Do you prefer to live in a certain area of the city?

In November, the Department of Water Management’s crews will begin the work to install a  new sewer main in W. 60th Street (Damen-Honore), in W. 60th Street (Paulina-Wood), and  in W. 62nd Street (Ashland-Marshfield). The old sewer dates back to 1901 and needs to be  replaced.     This project will require the full and continuous closure of Damen at 60th Street for about  three days. Detour routes will be posted in advance. Otherwise, when we are working in  the street, we may close it to traffic for safety reasons.  Outside of working hours, a travel  lane will be left open for local traffic only.  You will always be able to reach your home or  business.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am- 4pm).  We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but cars will need to be moved  by the start of the next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking as possible.    We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and  conducting ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on  your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman  during the project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour Service and Information Line:  311    15th Ward Office: 773-306-0837    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635   Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter  in your home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free  program, go to www.metersave.org.    Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important  infrastructure improvement project.          Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner

Sedgwick, Suite 400, Chicago, IL 60654        Phone 312/744-4111, Fax 312/744-1081, TTY 312/744-1088  www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations     GENDER IDENTITY DISCRIMINATION         Chicago’s  Human  Rights  Ordinance  and  Fair  Housing  Ordinance  prohibit  discrimination based on gender identity.     Gender identity is defined as the actual or perceived appearance, expression, identity, or behavior of a  person as being male or female—whether or not it is different from what is traditionally associated with  the person’s designated sex at birth.   Prohibiting  gender  identity  discrimination  protects  people  who  are  considered transgender,  who  are  in  transition  from  one  gender  to  another,  who  do  not  appear  clearly  male  or  female,  or  who  display  characteristics not typically associated with their assigned gender.  Such individuals are often subjected to  ridicule, exclusion, and hate crimes.        For example, it may be an ordinance violation—   •  For a business to subject a customer to derogatory slurs, ridicule, and other unwelcome verbal   or physical conduct because of the person’s gender identity.   •  For a business to deny a customer access to the restroom or similar private facility that are   open to persons of his or her sex based on the person’s gender identity.     •  For  an  employer  to  refuse  to  hire,  promote,  or  provide  equal  treatment  to  an  applicant  or   employee because of the person’s gender identity.   •  For a business or employer to question a person about gender identity in ways that are not   legitimate or reasonable.   •  For a housing provider to refuse to sell or rent, or in other ways limit equal access to available   housing because of a person’s gender identity.   Business operators may be held liable for discriminatory conduct of their employees.    Penalties for violations of the Human Rights or Fair Housing Ordinance include—   -     Fines of $100 to $1,000 per incident, paid to the City.  -     Damages and attorney fees, paid to the complaining party.  -     An injunction ordering specific actions to eliminate discriminatory practices.   Discriminatory conduct may also violate state or federal laws.  A finding of discrimination may affect the  continued licensure of a business by the City of Chicago as well as City contractor or vendor status.    A person who claims to have been subjected to discriminatory treatment based on gender identity may file  a discrimination complaint at the Commission on Human Relations.  The Commission may also initiate a  complaint.  The Commission investigates and rules on each discrimination complaint through a neutral  process  which  gives  complainants  and  respondents  the  opportunity  to  present  evidence  and  legal  arguments to support their positions.   See the back of this flyer for selected ordinance and regulation provisions.  For more information, see  www.cityofchicago.org/humanrelations.         SELECTED LEGAL PROVISIONS ON GENDER IDENTITY DISCRIMINATION     Section 2-160-020(f), Chicago Municipal Code (Human Rights Ordinance)  Definition of Gender Identity  “Gender identity” means the actual or perceived appearance, expression, identity or behavior, of a person as being  male or female, whether or not that appearance, expression, identity or behavior is different from that traditionally  associated with the person’s designated sex at birth.    Section 2-160-030, Chicago Municipal Code (Human Rights Ordinance)  Discriminatory Practices in Employment  No person shall directly or indirectly discriminate against any individual in hiring, classification, grading, discharge,  discipline,  compensation  or  other  term  or  condition  of  employment  because  of  the  individual’s  race,  color,  sex,  gender identity, age, religion, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status,  military  discharge  status  or  source  of  income.  No  employment  agency  shall  directly  or  indirectly  discriminate  against  any  individual  in  classification,  processing,  referral  or  recommendation  for  employment  because  of  the  individual’s race, color, sex, gender identity, age, religion, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation,  marital status, parental status, military status, or source of income….     Section 2-160-070, Chicago Municipal Code (Human Rights Ordinance)  Discriminatory Practices in Public Accommodations  No person that owns, leases, rents, operates, manages or in any manner controls a public accommodation  shall withhold, deny, curtail, limit or discriminate concerning the full use of such public accommodation  by any individual because of the individual’s race, color, sex, gender identity, age, religion, disability,  national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, military status, credit history  (employment only), criminal history (employment only), or source of income.  The prohibition contained  in this section shall not apply to the following:  (a)  a  private  club  or  other  establishment  not  in  fact  open  to  the  public,  except  to  the  extent  that  the  products, facilities or services thereof are made available to the general public or to the customers or  patrons of another establishment that is a public accommodation;   (b)  any facility, as to discrimination based on sex, which is distinctly private in nature, such as restrooms,   shower rooms, bathhouses, dressing rooms, and health clubs;….   (e)  …any person may use a public accommodation or any of its products, facilities or services that are  open to persons of his or her sex.

Their confluence provides the best river fishing in the City. At the end of the North Branch, water tumbles over a water fall, giving it the higher oxygen content that fish prefer.  2 3  The west side of the river        provides one  of the city's best nature hikes, as a wood-chipped trail winds along the banks of the river through restored river edge habitat. The trail and the restoration extend from Argyle to Lawrence. It was restored in 2002. Wild rye, penstemon, and columbine are thriving.  On the west side of the river north of Argyle, there are two canoe portage points and sections of native vegetation restoration that are fenced to protect them.

The east side of River Park has a paved bike path that extends unbroken to Peterson, is interrupted for a few blocks, and then continues along the east side of McCormick Boulevard (west of the Canal) through Lincolnwood and Evanston. At the far south end lies the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Lawrence Avenue pump station.  Directly north of Argyle, on the east side of  the river is a stand of old cottonwoods. Cottonwoods are a common tree in Chicago, but this stand of large ones likely pre-dates or coincides with early development of the city, before the land was  parkland. The cottonwood grove's presence next to the river is not coincidental; the continuous water source would have been instrumental in their germination and survival as seedlings.

I want to  be certain you are well informed about the project, and that you know where to  call if you have any questions or concerns.    Our crews will soon be installing 1,072 feet of 16-inch water main in S. Wabash  Ave. (E. Roosevelt Rd. to E. 14th St.). The old main dates back to 1886 and needs  to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Fioretti’s office, and he has made clear we are  to put great importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this  neighborhood through the whole term of this project.  Good communications is the  key.    I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor  the project closely.  We know that construction always involves inconveniences  and noise.  We will do everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise  and to conduct ourselves as good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our  presence on your street.    If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave  a message.      Thank you for your understanding and good will.      Sincerely    Thomas H. Powers, P.E.  Commissioner      cc:   Alderman Robert Fioretti       2nd Ward                                                Do you wonder what was happening in 1886?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                SIGMUND FREUD        Pharmacist Dr. John Stith Pemberton invented a carbonated beverage that would be   named “Coca-Cola”.  In New York Harbor, President Grover Cleveland dedicated the Statue of Liberty.       Baseball Hall of Famer Ty Cobb was born.    Karl Benz patented the first successful gasoline-driven automobile.    The first Tournament of Roses was held in Pasadena, California.    Sigmund Freud opened practice in Vienna.    The London Times published the world’s very first classified ad.                     PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project: The Department of Water Management is installing 1,072 feet of 16-inch water main  in S. Wabash Ave. (E. Roosevelt Rd. to E. 14th St.).    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1886 and we can expect increasingly frequent breaks if we don’t replace it.    Timing: Water main installation is anticipated to begin late May with completion of this project  projected for early August. Restoration (to be completed by the Chicago Department of  Transportation) will follow. This, of course, is an estimate. Sometimes there are unexpected  developments in the street, or other circumstances (e.g. weather) that force us to adjust our  schedules.      Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on S. Wabash Ave. without interruption, but we will have  to restrict parking around our work zone.    Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the  start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.    Service Interruptions:  We will have to interrupt water service for a brief period when we  transfer service pipes to the new main.  This will always be done with plenty of notice.  The  other possibility is that a break in the old main might force an immediate shutdown.  This is  common during construction.  We are replacing some pretty old pipes. We will make sure  neighbors know what is happening if that occurs.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE   3-1-1   ALDERMAN ROBERT FIORETTI   (312) 263-9273   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                     FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in early August.  Restoration (to be completed by the Chicago Department of Transportation) will follow. We  always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather  and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you  know what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,643 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Chappel Avenue, from E.  67th Street to E. 71st Street. The old pipe dates back to 1911, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Hairston’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:       LUCILLE BALL        Crisco, the all-vegetable shortening, was introduced.    On November 11, a record cold snap (later known as The Great Blue Norther 11/11/11)  hit the midwest United States. Many cities broke record highs and lows on the same day.     The Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre. It was recovered in 1913.    Ground breaking began in Boston for Fenway Park.    An audience threw vegetables at actors for the first recorded time in the U.S.    Lucille Ball was born.    The South Pole was reached for the first time, by Norwegian Roald Amundsen.                                     WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,643 feet of 8-inch  water main in S.

Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in July. Final restoration will follow in August. Dates may change depending on  weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.

There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in July. Final  restoration will follow in August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at  the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

General Information  Beginning May 1, 2006, taxicab licensees may apply for permits to display advertising on the exterior and interior of the vehicle.  Separate permits are required for each exterior and interior advertising display.    The fee for the issuance of any interior or exterior display permit shall be $100.00 for each display, payable at the time of application.  This fee shall be in addition to the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax that applies to lease or rental payments pursuant to chapter 3-32 of the municipal code.  Does this tax only apply to taxicabs?  No, although the ordinance  addresses taxicabs, per section 9-112-300(c) of the code, Public passenger vehicle charter/sightseeing licensees may apply for permits to display advertising on the exterior and interior of the vehicle.  Separate permits are required for exterior and interior advertising displays.    Does the permit expire?  An interior or exterior advertising permit issued shall expire one year after the date of issue, unless sooner surrendered, revoked or terminated.  In addition, permits cannot be transferred or assigned.    What is the Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax?  The Chicago Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax is a tax imposed on the lease or rental of personal property in the City of Chicago.  More specifically, per chapter 3-32-030 (A): Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a tax is imposed upon: (1) the lease or rental in the city of personal property, or (2) the privilege of using in the city personal property that is leased or rented outside the city. The incidence of the tax and the obligation to pay the tax are upon the lessee of the personal property.  What is the tax rate?  Per chapter 3-32-030 (B)     The rate of the tax shall be six percent of the lease or rental price. The tax shall be paid by the lessee at the time of each lease or rental payment, and each tax payment shall be determined by applying the tax rate to the lease or rental payment.  What is the responsibility of the lessor?  Per chapter 3-32-070 of the municipal code: It shall be the duty of each lessor to collect the tax imposed by this chapter from the lessee at the time of each lease or rental payment, and to remit the tax to the department in accordance with Section 3-32-080 of this chapter. In the event that a lessor fails to collect or remit the tax required to be collected by this section, the lessor shall be liable to the city for the amount of such tax.   Is there a commission granted for lessors who collect the tax?  Yes, the lessor is allowed a commission of 1% of the tax collected and timely remitted to the Department.  To be considered timely, the remittance and return must be physically received or received in an envelope postmarked by the Unites States Postal Service on or before the due date.   What are the penalties for late payments?  Per chapter 3-4 of the Municipal Code, late payments incur interest at a rate of 12% per annum simple interest, calculated daily, based on a 365 day calendar year and a late penalty rate of 5% of the tax due.  How do I register for the Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax?    Please call 312-747-4747 (Customer Service) and you will be given instructions as to what steps to take in order to register for the tax.  Failing to register and pay the tax in a timely manner may result in interest as well as late and negligence penalties being applied to payments not made.  How often is the tax paid?  The tax is to be remitted monthly with taxes collected in one month payable by the last day of the subsequent month.  The tax return for periods commencing on July 1st of each year and ending on June 30 of the subsequent year, is filed annually and is due by August 15th of each year.  Once registered, returns and payments can be made through the U.S. postal service, in person, or online at www.cityofchicago.org.  Questions?
