This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,890 feet of 8-inch water main in S. Baltimore Avenue, from  E. 86th Street to E. 87th Street, in S. Houston Avenue, from E. 86th Street to E. 87th Street, and in  E. 86th Street, from S. Commercial Avenue to S. Baltimore Avenue. The old pipe dates back to  1893, and needs to be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Holmes’ office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Natashia Holmes           7th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1                   Do you wonder what was happening in 1893?  That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                  MAE WEST        The World’s Columbian Exposition opened in Chicago.    Henry Perky and William Ford patented shredded wheat.    The first bowling magazine, which was called Gut Holz, was published.    France issued the first driver’s licenses, which included a required test.    Katharine Lee Bates wrote ""America the Beautiful,"" in Colorado.    Lizzie Borden was acquitted in the murder of her parents in New Bedford,   Massachusetts.     New Zealand became the first country to grant all its women the right to vote.    Actress Mae West was born.                      WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,890 feet of 8-inch  water main in S. Baltimore Avenue, from E. 86th Street to E. 87th Street, in S. Houston Avenue,  from E. 86th Street to E. 87th Street, and in E. 86th Street, from S. Commercial Avenue to S.  Baltimore Avenue.    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1893 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in July. Restoration will follow in August. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN NATASHIA HOLMES   773-731-7777      ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE          312-742-1029                   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in July. Restoration  will be completed in August. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the  mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!      "

Background   Rivers and streams experience flooding as a natural result of large rain storms or spring snowmelt that  quickly drains into streams and rivers. Although the risk for flooding varies across the United States,  most areas are susceptible to floods, even in dry and mountainous regions. The size, or magnitude, of  flood events is influenced by how much water enters the waterway upstream—and how quickly. Flood  frequency largely depends on the frequency of weather events.     Large flood events can damage homes, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure; wipe out farmers’ crops;  and harm or displace people. Although regular flooding helps to maintain the nutrient balance of soils in  the flood plain, larger or more frequent floods could disrupt ecosystems by displacing aquatic life,  impairing water quality, and increasing soil erosion. By inundating water treatment systems with  sediment and contaminants, and promoting the growth of harmful microbes, floods can directly affect  the water supplies that communities depend on.     Climate change may cause river floods to become larger or more frequent than they used to be in some  places, yet become smaller and less frequent in other places. As warmer temperatures cause more  water to evaporate from the land and oceans, changes in the size and frequency of heavy precipitation  events may in turn affect the size and frequency of river flooding (see the Heavy Precipitation  indicator).1 Changes in streamflow, the timing of snowmelt (see the Streamflow indicator), and the  amount of snowpack that accumulates in the winter (see the Snowpack indicator) can also affect flood  patterns.    About the Indicator   The U.S. Geological Survey maintains thousands of stream gauges across the United States. Each gauge  measures water level and discharge—the amount of water flowing past the gauge. This indicator uses  total daily discharge data from about 500 long-term stream gauge stations where trends are not  substantially influenced by dams, reservoir management, wastewater treatment facilities, or land-use  change.   One way to determine whether the magnitude of flooding has changed is by studying the largest flood  event from each year. This indicator examines the maximum discharge from every year at every station  to identify whether peak flows have generally increased or decreased. This indicator also analyzes  whether large flood events have become more or less frequent over time, based on daily discharge  records.   This indicator starts in 1965 because flood data have been available for a large number of sites to  support a national-level analysis since then.          1   Climate Change Indicators in the United States: River Flooding   www.epa.gov/climate-indicators - August 2016       Key Points   •  Floods have generally become larger in rivers and streams across large parts of the Northeast  and Midwest. Flood magnitude has generally decreased in the West, southern Appalachia, and  northern Michigan (see Figure 1).   •   •   Large floods have become more frequent across the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and northern  Great Plains. Flood frequency has decreased in some other parts of the country, especially the  Southwest and the Rockies (see Figure 2).    Increases and decreases in frequency and magnitude of river flood events generally coincide  with increases and decreases in the frequency of heavy rainfall events.2,3         2   Climate Change Indicators in the United States: River Flooding   www.epa.gov/climate-indicators - August 2016       Figure 1. Change in the Magnitude of River Flooding in the United States, 1965–2015   This figure shows changes in the size of flooding events in rivers and streams in the United States  between 1965 and 2015. Blue upward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become  larger; brown downward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become smaller. The  larger, solid-color symbols represent stations where the change was statistically significant.

Change in the Frequency of River Flooding in the United States, 1965–2015   This figure shows changes in the frequency of flooding events in rivers and streams in the United States  between 1965 and 2015. Blue upward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become more  frequent; brown downward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become less frequent.  The larger, solid-color symbols represent stations where the change was statistically significant.  Data source: Slater and Villarini, 20165   Indicator Notes   This indicator is based on U.S. stream gauges that have recorded data consistently since 1965. Besides  climate change, many other types of human influences could affect the frequency and magnitude of  floods—for example, dams, floodwater management activities, agricultural practices, and changes in  land use. To remove these influences, this indicator focuses on a set of sites that are not heavily  influenced by human activities, in watersheds that do not have a large proportion of impervious surfaces  such as concrete and asphalt. Increased flooding does not necessarily result in an increased risk to  people or property if an area has protective infrastructure, such as levees or floodwalls.   4   Climate Change Indicators in the United States: River Flooding   www.epa.gov/climate-indicators - August 2016       Data Sources   Daily stream gauge data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. These data came from a set of  gauges in watersheds with minimal human impacts, which have been classified as reference gauges.6  Daily discharge data are stored in the National Water Information System and are publicly available at:  http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis.                                                           1   Mallakpour, I., G.

By early August 2016, Department of Water Management (DWM) and Benchmark Construction  Company crews will begin the work to install 1,342 feet of new 12-inch water main in S. Ashland  Avenue, from W. 121st Street to W. 123rd Street.  The old water main dates back to 1909, and needs  to be replaced.    If you would like to receive regular email updates about the progress of the project, please go to  BuildingANewChicago.org to register for the WaterALERT program.  Simply enter your name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.   By signing up for the WaterALERT emails, you will be notified as the project enters each new  construction phase – from our mobilization of equipment onto the site, to the installation of new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.   When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.    We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.   We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do everything  possible to maintain your quality of life throughout these projects, and conducting ourselves as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.    Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:    •  24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311  •  34th Ward Office: 773-928-6961  •  DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635        Genwmnot03032016          Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main    When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.   Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.     Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.  (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose spigot, laundry sink faucet or bathtub) to where  the water comes into the home that is not used for  drinking water. Fully open the cold water tap and let  the water run for at least 5 minutes.  Next flush any  other cold water faucets on that floor for at least 5  minutes.   (2)Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.      If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, or if you would like your water  tested, please call us at 311.  For additional advice and information visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago-residents-about-lead-drinking-water.   Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.     MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.   Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation during this important infrastructure  improvement project.   Sincerely,      Barrett B. Murphy  Commissioner            Genwmnot03032016

Municipal Code 7-12-140 requires all dogs four months and older be registered with the City of   Chicago.    It helps us locate your lost dog. The person who finds your dog simply calls our office at 312-744-DOGS with   your registration number (on your dog’s tag).    Dogs must be registered in order to stay at dog boarding and daycare service facilities.   Dog registration is a prerequisite for acquiring permission to enter Chicago Park District dog-friendly areas.   Dogs must have a current rabies vaccination. Get your dog vaccinated at any Chicago area veterinarian clinic or  other licensed provider.     Your dog’s registration expires on either the registration expiration date (i.e. 1 or 3 years after purchase,  depending on the length you purchase) or the expiration date of its current rabies vaccination, whichever comes  first. Since rabies vaccinations typically last either one or three years (depending on the vaccination administered  by your dog’s vet), the clerk’s office offers dog registration in 1-year and 3 year increments.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 5,164 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Neva Avenue (Diversey- Altgeld), in N. Mont Clare Avenue (Diversey-Altgeld), in W. Altgeld Street (Harlem-Mont  Clare), and in N. Neva Avenue (Atlgeld-Grand). The old pipe dates back to 1904, and needs to  be replaced.      We are coordinating with Alderman Sposato’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Nicholas Sposato             36th Ward   1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             Do you ever wonder what was happening in 1904? That’s the year the old water main was  installed beneath your street. Among other things:                 RAY BOLGER AS “THE SCARECROW”                 The first athletic letters were given, to the University of Chicago football team.    The U.S. acquired control of the Panama Canal Zone for $10,000,000.    The ice cream cone made its debut.    The third modern Olympic Games were held, in St. Louis, MO.    Actor Ray Bolger (the Scarecrow in “The Wizard of Oz”) was born.    Wilbur Wright made his first airplane flight.    The New York City subway opened; fare was a nickel.                                    WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 5,164 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Neva Avenue (Diversey-Altgeld), in N. Mont Clare Avenue (Diversey- Altgeld), in W. Altgeld Street (Harlem-Mont Clare), and in N. Neva Avenue (Atlgeld-Grand).    Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1904 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late December. Final restoration will follow in late May 2015. Dates may change  depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow outside of our working hours.  When we are working in  the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach  your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours,  a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.            CONTACT NUMBERS      24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1      ALDERMAN NICHOLAS SPOSATO   773-836-0036                           FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS        What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.      Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late December.  Final restoration will be completed in late May 2015. We always hesitate to promise specific  dates, since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.      AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1             When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.      Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.     Volunteer for a meter today to save water and money!        Please go to www.metersave.org     By phone call 3-1-1, or 312-744-4H2O.           Save Water Save Money!

This report and the Board's written   2   Findings and Decisions are posted on the   3   Board's Website.                                                                                                                      4                 The general orders and other   5   directives issued by the Superintendent of   6   Police during this previous month are listed in   7   the books made available at this evening's   8   meeting and also posted on the Police   9   Department's website.  10                 First Deputy Navarro, do you have  11   a report?  12       FIRST DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT NAVARRO:  Yes.  13   First off, I wanted to thank everybody for  14   attending the meeting.  15                 The last two years, CPD has began  16   focusing our efforts to be a better agency for  17   both the public, you, and our officers.  18                 We've made a lot of progress, but  19   the challenges won't occur overnight.  Can't  20   fix the Department overnight.  We realize that.  21                 The Superintendent has made it  22   quite clear that it's very important that we  23   get it done right, not quickly.  24                 A couple of highlights:  Our new  Victoria Legal + Corporate Services800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.comPolice Board Public Meeting - October 19, 2017  5        1   use-of-force policy went into effect a few days   2   ago.  Of course, as everybody knows, this is   3   the first use-of-force policy where we had   4   public input, and we appreciate that, first   5   time ever.   6                 The use-of-force policy focuses   7   on the sanctity of life and deescalation.  So   8   we want officers to look at that.   9                 We also want officers to be  10   trained on this use-of-force policy every year.  11   That hasn't been done before.  12                 So officers will be trained on  13   the proper use of force every year.  14                 By the end of the year, every  15   officer on patrol will have a body camera and a                                                                                                                     16   Taser.  17                 We want to make sure that the  18   transparency is there.  And with the use of  19   body cameras, we think that will happen.  20                 We're working to spread community  21   policing throughout the Department.  22                  As the Superintendent has said  23   before, community policing is not a unit in the  24   Police Department, it's a philosophy.  We want  Victoria Legal + Corporate Services800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.comPolice Board Public Meeting - October 19, 2017  6        1   our officers to get out of the cars and talk   2   and mingle and interact with the citizens.   3                 Officers in the academy are now   4   given cultural sensitivity training at the   5   DuSable Museum.  That's something new that   6   we've done for a few months now.  And   7   additional resources will be coming for   8   community policing as the Mayor has announced   9   from the budget.  10                 We've also taken recommendations  11   from the Advisory Panel with public input  12   coming soon.  So we'll be looking forward to                                                                                                                     13   that.  14                 We had made a recent personnel  15   change recently.  Dwayne Betts, the former  16   commander of the 15th District, is now the new  17   deputy chief of the CAPS program.  18                 Dwayne, if you can stand up,  19   please, and be recognized.  Thank you.  20                 Something unique.  We're working  21   with the Attorney General, the Illinois  22   Attorney General, on the next steps in the  23   consent decree process.  24                 So those are some of our  Victoria Legal + Corporate Services800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.comPolice Board Public Meeting - October 19, 2017  20        1                 Our next speaker is Nataki   2   Rhodes.  Ms. Rhodes.   3       MS. RHODES:  Thank you for the opportunity   4   for letting me address this unelected,   5   undemocratic, ultimately unaccountable board,   6   which we, the people, exercise no control over.   7                 Now, you say that this is a   8   profound day for you all.  It can't be   9   possible, because just earlier this year, you  10   allowed four police officers to come back to  11   work that was involved in Laquan McDonald.  You  12   all, the Board, continues to cover up all the  13   way up to Rahm Emanuel.  You all allow four  14   officers to come back from suspension and to                                                                                                                     15   come back to desk duty.  16                 We, the people, do not want them  17   to be at desk duty.  We, the people, do not  18   want them to collect benefits.  We, the people,  19   want for you to start the process of firing.  20   Rahm Emanuel must start the process of firing  21   Jason Van Dyke, the four officers, plus the  22   fifth officer.  You all have heard the tape.  23   Lori lightfoot, if you are really profound,  24   show justice.  Show us justice.  Victoria Legal + Corporate Services800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com
