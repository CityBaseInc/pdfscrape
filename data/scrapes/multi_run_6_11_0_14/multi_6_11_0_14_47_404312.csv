The Commission is responsible for recommend- ing to the City Council which individual buildings, sites, objects, or districts should be designated as Chicago Landmarks, which protects them by law.  The landmark designation process begins with a staff study and a preliminary summary of information related to the potential designation criteria.  The next step is a preliminary vote by the landmarks commission as to whether the proposed landmark is worthy of consideration.  This vote not only initiates the formal designation process, but it places the review of city permits for the property under the jurisdiction of the Commission until a final landmark recommendation is acted on by the City Council.  This Landmark Designation Report is subject to possible revision and amendment during the designation process. Only language contained within the designation ordinance adopted by the City Council should be regarded as final.  NEIGHBORHOOD BANK BUILDINGS (LIST OF BUILDINGS ON PAGE 2)  From the post-Chicago Fire period up to the mid-twentieth century, Chicago experienced rapid outward growth.  Not unlike other American cities, this dynamic growth process created a “city of neighborhoods,” each with its own commercial and economic life.  During the first-half of the twentieth century, Illinois state law prohibited banks from opening multiple branches to prevent the growth of banking monopolies.  Consequently, independent neighborhood banks played an important role in the development of Chicago by providing financial services and building and business loans.  In many cases, neighborhood banks identified with and served particular ethnic or immigrant groups in local neighborhoods, thus several of these buildings convey the contributions of these groups within specific neighborhoods.  Historic neighborhood bank buildings express the historical, economic and social development of Chicago’s diverse neighborhoods.  Neighborhood bank buildings from this period were often of very high architectural quality and located near prominent intersections and sites.  The neighborhood bank buildings included in this report are some of the most outstanding examples of the many historic bank buildings located throughout Chicago.  Most were built during a “golden age” of bank architecture in America that occurred after the financial panic of 1907 and before the Great Depression of 1929; conveying a sense of permanence and trust, these monumental buildings were built of high-style architecture, expensive materials, and fine craftsmanship.  They represent the work of prominent architects, and all are exceptional examples of architectural styles significant during the years of their construction.  As a group, they represent some of the finest historic architecture found in Chicago’s neighborhoods.  1  NEIGHBORHOOD BANK BUILDINGS  (FORMER) SWEDISH AMERICAN STATE BANK  5400 N.

The rapid expansion of the city and its transportation network resulted in a vast series of outlying neighborhoods by the early 1900s, each of which had its own identity and shopping district.  Bustling local commercial centers— typically located near where street car lines intersected or near elevated rail lines—offered a wide range of venues for shopping and entertainment, featuring clusters of small shops, restaurants, theaters, office buildings and department stores.  These “cities within a city” met the basic needs of residents, who saw no reason to travel downtown regularly.  During the first half of the twentieth century, Illinois state laws prohibited banks from opening multiple branches.  The intention of the law was to prevent the growth of bank monopolies and to support small independent banks.  As a result of the law, a large number of independent banks were established throughout Chicago neighborhoods to serve the banking needs of local communities, including mortgages, business loans, and checking and savings accounts for middle- and working-class residents.  Neighborhood banks focused on catering to, and reinvesting in, their surrounding communities, responding to the need for local financial services. The growth of outlying banks in Chicago was very closely tied to real estate development in the neighborhoods, and in many cases, handsome profits of the banks were due to profits made on their real estate loans.  Bank failures in 1906 created an economic recession in 1907 that led many states to pass laws regulating the banking industry, including prohibiting branch banking.  This photos shows a “bank run” on the Milwaukee Avenue State Bank in August 1906. The bank, now demolished, was located at 739-47 Milwaukee Avenue.  3  Reflecting their neighborhood focus, banking institutions were typically organized by prominent local businessmen who served as directors and officers, and their stock was generally owned by local residents and merchants.  In neighborhoods with a strong ethnic identity, the neighborhood bank was often founded by prominent members of that community.  By focusing their services on a specific ethnic group, some neighborhood banks reflect the neighborhood development patterns as ethnic groups grew and moved throughout the city.  Many private banks reorganized under state charters following the enactment of a law in 1919 prohibiting their existence.  A July 28, 1921, advertisement in the Chicago Tribune highlights a contemporary view of neighborhood banks:  The result of the very bigness of Chicago has brought about localized business centers.  Step by step with the growth of Chicago has come the establishment of a wonderful array of outlying banks.  These financial institutions exert a tremendous influence on the business and civic life of Chicago.  They are more than clearing houses of their respective community.  In most cases they are the community centers as well.  On the evenings in the hours these banks open their doors to the public, hundreds of thousands of people assemble to transact their banking business.  Not only are these banks safe, convenient depositories for the funds of the people, they are investment centers.  Neighborhood bank buildings were typically sited near key intersections in commercial districts, often on corners, serving as prominent visual landmarks for residents of those neighborhoods. These imposing structures were readily distinguished from the surrounding streetscape due to their distinctive designs, often incorporating classical and more monumentally-scaled elements, quality cladding materials, and fine craftsmanship.  Although the two- to three-story height of most bank buildings was in scale with the surrounding streetscape, some banks erected office buildings that were considerably larger.  These 6- to 12-story buildings sharply contrasted with the existing low-scale commercial streetscape.  In 1900 there were only 11 neighborhood bank buildings in Chicago, with total deposits of $22 million.  New banks continued to open during the years prior to World War I, and 1914 saw 66 neighborhood banks with deposits of $126 million.  The greatest proliferation of neighborhood banks, however, occurred during the 1920s, a period of tremendous growth for Chicago.  In 1924, there were 173 neighborhood banks with total deposits of $615 million.  Their number peaked at 195 in January 1929, with deposits totaling $769 million.  There were more deposits in Chicago’s outlying neighborhood banks than in all the combined banks of six states—Idaho, New Mexico, Wyoming, Delaware, Montana, and North Dakota.  The spectacular growth of Chicago’s neighborhood banks over such a short period of time made the panic that occurred after the Stock Market Crash of 1929 all the more devastating. Between 1929 and 1932, a wave of bank failures reduced the ranks of Chicago’s 195 neighborhood banks to 110, as the institutions paid out the enormous sum of $450 million on  4  Construction of new banks came to an abrupt end in 1929 with the onset of the Great Depression, and the hiatus on the establishment of new banks continued through World War II. By the time bank construction resumed in the 1950s, transformations in both the banking industry and architectural styles resulted in great changes in bank architecture.  To repair its tarnished image following the bank failures of the 1930s, the banking industry embraced architectural Modernism to convey an up-to-date image.  EARLY-TWENTIETH CENTURY BANK ARCHITECTURE IN CHICAGO  Banks, like churches and courthouses, are often among the most distinctive institutional buildings in a community, typically sited at or near major commercial intersections, most often on corner sites, and serving as prominent visual landmarks.  Prior to World War II, their designs usually were within a range of conservative historical styles that projected their role as quasi-civic institutions.  Designs generally relied on a traditional architectural vocabulary, such as the Classical Revival (based on ancient Greek and Roman architecture) or the Colonial Revival (derived from Colonial and Georgian).  As with government buildings, these styles were selected to convey an image of permanence and stability.  The Art Deco was increasingly used for bank buildings during the 1920s, reflecting the growing preference within the banking industry to utilize a more modern architectural style.  The Great Depression in 1930s followed by World War II interrupted the construction of new banks.  When the industry recovered in the mid- twentieth century, bank architecture was radically reshaped by the influence of modernism.  Although Chicago’s 19th-century banks were typically housed in a portion of an existing commercial building, during the early twentieth century the city’s banks became freestanding, self-contained, purpose-built structures.  Through the 1920s, most banks in Chicago were built in the Classical Revival style, which was drawn from a variety of sources, including ancient Greek and Roman architecture, and later the Renaissance and the early-twentieth-century Beaux Arts classicism related to the influential architecture school in Paris.  The architecture of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago extended the popularity of the Classical Revival style across the United States.  With its ability to convey a sense of security, permanence, and strength, the Classical Revival style was well-suited to early-twentieth-century bank architecture.  Classical Revival-style bank facades were often designed to resemble Greek and Roman temples, and Chicago examples often incorporated “giant” classical order design treatments. The term “giant” or colossal order refers to the use of two- to three-story tall columns and large-scale details.  Another common iteration was the use of two-story tall round-arched openings, either as a solitary design element or grouped in arcades.  Examples of facades dominated by a single-arched opening include the Calumet National Bank at 9117 S. Commercial Avenue and the Swedish American State Bank at 5400 N. Clark Street.   A monumental and highly ornamented Classical arched entrance is the most notable feature on the Belmont-Sheffield Trust and Savings Bank at 1001 W. Belmont Avenue, a building that otherwise resembles a handsome commercial block.  A derivation of the “temple-front” bank is the South Side Trust at 4659 S. Cottage Grove with its two-story Corinthian columns framing  6  Common facade treatments found in Classical Revival-style banks include the “temple- front” (above left) as exemplified by the South Side Trust and Savings Bank, and the use of large arcaded windows (above right) as seen at the Fullerton State Bank.  To maximize valuable real estate, some bank buildings incorporated multiple, income-generating uses into the overall design. At the Belmont-Sheffield Trust and Savings Bank (above), the banking hall originally occupied the central part of the first two stories, while the remaining area of the second floor and the entire third floor was used for rental offices.  The ground floor was also occupied by retail uses, and the upper three floors were used for hotel rooms.  7  The Belmont-Sheffield Trust and Savings Bank thrived from 1929 to 1932, but was forced to close on July 6, 1933, during the Depression.  It went into receivership, and its assets were liquefied by 1942.  The former bank space remained vacant until 1943, when it temporarily served as the headquarters of the local rationing board.  The remainder of the building was used as the Montfield Hotel during the ensuing decades.  In 1984, the building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and subsequently converted into 54 apartments. More recently it has been renovated into condominiums.  The Belmont-Sheffield Trust and Savings Bank is a handsome commercial block with a monumental arched entrance on Belmont that stands as its most prominent Classical feature. The three-story entrance is flanked by freestanding Ionic columns and topped by a triumphal arch surrounded by stylized ornamentation in low-relief.  Walls are clad with limestone on the first four stories.  Buff colored brick and light-gray ornamental terra-cotta are used on the remaining two stories.  The building's symmetrical street elevations feature double-hung windows arranged in groups of three and limestone beltcourses situated above the third and fourth stories.  The building's sparing use of ornamentation features both Art Deco and Classical motifs. Medallions of medusae between the fourth floor window bays, and flattened geometric motifs on the spandrels of the two upper floors, are typical of the Art Deco style. The building's roofline is enlivened by projecting acanthus leaf ornamentation.  The exterior of the building displays excellent integrity in terms of its historic design, materials and detailing.  Exterior alterations mainly consist of changes to the ground-floor storefronts.  The rendering above accom- panied a 1928 report in the Chicago Tribune on the then ongoing construction of the Belmont-Sheffield Bank.  The detail (left) is of the carved limestone entrance arch on Belmont Avenue.  12

Currently, the risk of influenza infection in the Chicago area is low, but a couple of indicators suggest a slight increase in risk.   The percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza is at it’s highest level seen all season and two influenza-associated  ICU hospitalizations were reported for week 6.  However, compared to the same time period last season, the number of posi- tive influenza specimens and the number of influenza-associated hospitalizations reported to CDPH remains substantially  lower, with a greater than 90% decrease in both.  Vaccination is the best way to protect against human seasonal influenza in- fection and all Chicagoans aged six months and older are encouraged to get vaccinated. Chicagoans should ask their health- care provider or pharmacist about vaccine availability.  Uninsured individuals and those with insurance that does not cover flu  shots can obtain a voucher for a free flu shot at Walgreens1.  The Chicago Department of Public Health has influenza vaccine  available at CDPH immunization clinics2.      Figure 1. Weekly reported percent of emergency department visits  attributed to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current season  (2011-2012) and previous two seasons, October-May.   Are severe cases of influenza occurring?                                                                                                                                             Two influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were re- ported for week 6 (February 5-11, 2012).  Since October  2011, three influenza-associated ICU hospitalization have  been reported.  Suspected novel influenza, pediatric influ- enza-associated deaths, and influenza-associated ICU hos- pitalizations should all be reported to CDPH via  INEDSS3.  Outbreaks of influenza-like illness in a con- gregate setting are also reportable; in Chicago these re- ports can be made by phone to (312) 746-5911.         How much influenza-like illness is occurring?                    For the week of February 5-11, 2012, with 17 hospitals  reporting, 4.2% of emergency room visits were due to ILI  (i.e., fever of 100°F or greater, with cough or sore throat).  This is nearly three percentage points lower than levels  reported during the same surveillance week in 2011  (Figure 1).  From February 5-11, 2012, with 16 outpatient  clinics reporting, 2.6% of outpatient clinic visits were due  to ILI.  This is the fourth consecutive week that an in- crease has been noted (Figure 2).     Figure 2. Weekly reported percent of outpatient clinic visits attributed  to influenza-like illness, Chicago,  by week, for current season (2011- 2012) and previous season (Chicago and Illinois), October-May.   Which influenza strains are circulating?                          Data on influenza virus test results are reported by Chi- cago laboratories performing influenza subtyping.  For   the week of February 5-11, 2012, with 6 laboratories re- porting, 8 of 240 (3.3%) specimens tested for influenza  were positive, 4 typed as influenza A (3 H1N1, 1 H3N2),  and 4 typed as influenza B.  Since October 2011, 25 out  of 3,095 (<1%) specimens tested for influenza have been  positive,  with 18 typed as influenza A (9 H3N2, 6 H1N1,  and 3 not subtyped) and 7 typed as influenza B.       Where can I get more information?                                    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Flu- View4 report provides national updates and trends related  to the intensity of influenza activity across the United  States, as well as detailed information on antiviral resis-   tance, severity of illness, and other topics.

Daley  Dear Water Customer:  As  Mayor  of  the  City  of  Chicago,  I  am  pleased  to  bring  you  our  annual report  on  the  quality  of  Chicago’s  drinking  water.  Not  only  does  Chicago’s water meet and exceed all state and Federal standards as regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, but I believe it is among the best tasting and most economical drinking water in the country.  The Chicago Department of Water Management purifies more than one billion gallons of water per day for distribution throughout Chicago and 123 neighboring suburbs. Through the efforts of the  citizens of Chicago and the Water Department, our city has shown a 30 percent decrease in water usage  since  1990.  However,  it  takes  the  participation  of  everyone  to  ensure  that  our  precious resources will be here for generations to come.    I invite you to read this report and learn about our Senior Citizen Exemption and installing a new  automatic  metering  system.  The  report  also  outlines  specific  ideas  for  you  to  use  at  home  to  conserve water, including disconnecting downspouts and installing rain barrels.   Please make every effort to use water wisely and thank you for your interest in the City of Chicago’s water quality.  Sincerely,   Mayor  Para  obtener  el  informe  de  la  calidad  del  agua  2006  en español, por favor llame a nuestro centro de información al numero (312) 744-4H2O (744-4426).  WATER: The Pure Facts  • Water regulates the earth's temperature.  • The  overall  amount  of  water  on  our  planet  has  remained the same for two billion years.  • Most of the earth's surface water is permanently frozen  or salty.  • Water  moves  around  the  earth  in  a  water  cycle.  The water cycle has five parts: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration and surface run-off.  • Water is the only substance that is found naturally on  earth in three forms: liquid, gas, solid.  • Don't over water your lawn.   • To  prevent  water  loss  from  evaporation,  don't  water your lawn during the hottest part of the day or when it is windy.   • Defrost  frozen  food  in  the  refrigerator  or  in  the  microwave instead of running water over it.   • When washing dishes by hand, use two basins—one for washing and one for rinsing rather than let the water run.   • Use  a  broom,  rather  than  a  hose,  to  clean  sidewalks  and driveways.   •  If you have a swimming pool, get a cover. You'll cut the loss of water by evaporation by 90 percent.   • Repair  dripping  faucets  and  leaky  toilets.  Dripping faucets  can  waste  about  2,000  gallons  of  water  each year. Leaky toilets can waste as much as 200 gallons each day.  • A quarter  of  the  world's  population  is  without  safe   drinking water.

The Commission is re- sponsible for recommending to the City Council which individual buildings, sites, objects, or  districts should be designated as Chicago Landmarks, which protects them by law.   The landmark designation process begins with a staff study and a preliminary summary   of information related to the potential designation criteria. The next step is a preliminary vote  by the landmarks commission as to whether the proposed landmark is worthy of consideration.  This vote not only initiates the formal designation process, but it places the review of city per- mits for the property under the jurisdiction of the Commission until a final landmark recom- mendation is acted on by the City Council.   This Landmark Designation Report is subject to possible revision and amendment dur- ing the designation process. Only language contained within a designation ordinance adopted  by the City Council should be regarded as final.   2                                                 B. LEO STEIF AND COMPANY (1926-27)   1921 (ORIGINAL FOUR STORIES)  1926-27 (ADDITIONAL FOUR STORIES)   MUTUAL INSURANCE BUILDING   (ORIGINALLY EMERMAN BUILDING)   4750 N. SHERIDAN RD.    BUILT:     ARCHITECTS:   FUGARD AND KNAPP (1921)      The Mutual Insurance Building, located at 4750 N. Sheridan Road, is an eight-story, terra cotta-clad  office building. The structure, originally known as the Emerman Building, was developed as a four- story speculative commercial building in 1921. With its prominent location at the southwest corner  of Lawrence Avenue and Sheridan Road, coupled with its visually-refined, Classical Revival-style  design, the building was a prominent addition to Uptown‘s burgeoning business district, which was  developing as one of the City‘s largest neighborhood commercial districts. Within just five years,  surging demand for office space in the area prompted the construction of four additional stories.  Upon its completion in 1927, the stately structure—one of the largest office buildings in Chicago to  be constructed outside of the Loop—reflected Uptown‘s emergence as the City‘s second  ―downtown.‖    In 1928, the Emerman Building was rechristened the ―Mutual Insurance Building‖ by insurance  industry innovator James S. Kemper. The building‘s new name served as a collective reference to  the numerous mutual insurance firms, all under the direction of James Kemper, that were headquar- tered in the building including Lumbermans Mutual Casualty Company and the large holding com- pany known as James S. Kemper & Company. During the four decades that Kemper‘s companies  operated from the building, the continued growth of this successful nationally-known mutual insur- ance firm established Chicago as one of the largest insurance centers in the United States. The Mu- tual Insurance Building exemplifies the development of this important industry and reflects its sub- stantial impact on the economic history of Chicago.     3   The Mutual Insurance Build- ing is an eight-story com- mercial office building in the  Uptown community area.  It  was built in two stages  (1921, 1926-27) and is locat- ed on the southwest corner  of W. Lawrence Ave. and N.  Sheridan Rd.   N   Mutual   Insurance  Building   4   The Mutual Insurance Building is also significant for its Classical Revival-style design and  finely detailed light cream-colored glazed terra cotta ornamentation manufactured by the North- western Terra Cotta Company, the largest of Chicago‘s terra-cotta manufacturers in the early  20th century. Characterized by its orderly visual rhythms and fine scale and proportion, the  building possesses a dignified presence. Due to its height and fine craftsmanship, this mid-rise  neighborhood ―skyscraper‖ is a visual ―bookend‖ to the (Former) Sheridan Trust and Savings  Bank Building (also commonly known as the Uptown Bank Building), a designated Chicago  Landmark located three blocks west at 4753 N. Broadway.      COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN UPTOWN (1900-1920S)    The development of Uptown‘s commercial core, primarily situated along Broadway and Law- rence and Wilson Avenues, began in the early 1900s and reached its pinnacle with a building  boom that extended through the 1920s into the early 1930s. Much of the growth of Uptown co- incided with the construction of elevated train stops which improved access to the community  from the city‘s downtown. In 1900, an elevated train stop was established at Wilson and Broad- way to serve as the northern terminus of the Northwestern Elevated Railroad Company line  from the Loop. Up to this time the area still had a distinctly rural character, despite modest de- velopment along Broadway (formerly Evanston Avenue).    After the extension of the elevated line, residential and commercial development along Wilson,  Broadway and Lawrence began in earnest. Construction of small flat buildings and one- to three -story commercial buildings commenced on largely undeveloped streets that earlier had con- tained only a scattering of single-family houses and graystones.  By 1908, the elevated line was  extended to include a stop at Lawrence Avenue. Also at this time a local businessman commis- sioned the construction of a combined shopping arcade-train station at the Wilson elevated stop.  The structure, completed in 1909 by architect John S. Van Bergen, was demolished in 1923 and  replaced with the current CTA Red Line station at Wilson Avenue.      The name ―Uptown‖ is credited to businessman Loren Miller, who in 1915 opened a store  called the ―Uptown Store.‖ Six years later, in January 1921, he began printing The Up-Town  Advertiser, a free advertising circular whose popularity prompted some local businesses to  adopt the ―Uptown‖ name as part of their advertising. By the early 1920s, Uptown boasted a  diverse collection of restaurants, theatres, dance halls, cafes and shops that offered an alterna- tive to Chicago‘s downtown stores and entertainment establishments. Construction of a perma- nent elevated train station at the intersection of Broadway and Lawrence Avenue was complet- ed in 1923. The Lawrence stop, located three blocks west of the Mutual Insurance Building,  solidified the character of Lawrence Avenue between Broadway and Sheridan Road as a busi- ness center and prompted further development along Sheridan Road, including the expansion of  the Mutual Insurance Building to its current height.     In contrast to the modest brick buildings constructed during the area‘s first wave of develop- ment (1900-1915), the structures of Uptown‘s second period of development (1920-1930) were  designed to stand out through their scale and the quality of their architecture. It was during this  period that Broadway and Lawrence Avenue―the key commercial arteries of Up- town―became densely built with large-scale, often visually-lavish office and retail buildings,  theaters, ballrooms, and luxury apartment residences. These fine structures, frequently sheathed   5   The Mutual Insurance Building exemplifies the his- toric commercial development of the Uptown  neighborhood, which emerged in the 1920s as one  of Chicago’s most important outlying retail, office  and entertainment districts.  Top: A postcard view  of W. Lawrence Ave., looking west from N. Sheri- dan Rd.  The Mutual Insurance Building is in the  left foreground of the picture (see arrow).   “Uptown Square,” as this commercial district was  known, was made up of a combination of large- scale office buildings, hotels, and theaters, along  with lower-scale retail and residential buildings.     Above left: A postcard of the New Lawrence Hotel, built across and just west on Lawrence from  the Mutual Insurance Building.  Bottom right: The Uptown Bank Building, a designated Chicago  Landmark, (now housing a branch of the Bridgeview Bank) is a white terra-cotta-clad office build- ing similar in scale, building material and architectural style to the Mutual Insurance Building.  The  two buildings “bookend” this portion of Lawrence.      6   with terra cotta executed in historic revival architectural styles ranging from Classical Revival  to Moorish and Spanish Baroque, are represented by the Mutual Insurance Building, the Up- town Broadway Building at 4707 N. Broadway, the Uptown Theatre at 4814 N. Broadway (a  designated Chicago Landmark), and the Aragon Ballroom at 1100 W. Lawrence Avenue.     While most of the buildings constructed in Uptown‘s thriving commercial center were two to  four stories, some mid-rise ―skyscrapers‖ were also developed in the area.  Ranging from 8 to  12 stories in height, these neighborhood ―high-rises‖ were not as tall as Loop skyscrapers built  at the same time.  However, they contrasted so significantly with the existing low-scale com- mercial and residential Uptown streetscapes that they appeared to rise to dramatic heights.  Characterized by their visual sophistication and prominence, Uptown skyscrapers include the  Mutual Insurance Building, the (Former) Sheridan Trust and Savings Bank Building at 4753 N.  Broadway (a designated Chicago Landmark), the New Lawrence Hotel at 1020 W. Lawrence  Avenue, and the Wilton Hotel at 1053 W. Lawrence Avenue.       DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION HISTORY OF   THE MUTUAL INSURANCE BUILDING    In 1919, as real estate speculation began to inflate property values in Uptown, Herman Emer- man, the developer of the Mutual Insurance Building, began acquiring parcels of land along  Lawrence Avenue near Sheridan Road. Through three separate transactions he assembled five  contiguous lots to gain ownership of a sizeable corner parcel measuring 150 feet by 250 feet.  Recognizing the growth potential of Uptown, Emerman planned to develop a four-story com- mercial building on the property to offer business owners an alternative to more costly office  space in the Loop. He envisioned an elegant structure anchored by stores ―devoted to merchants  of the better grade while the second and third floors will be occupied by exclusive shops.‖ The  fourth floor would be dedicated to suites for physicians and other professional offices.     Intent on creating a refined sophisticated structure, Emerman gave the building commission to  the architecture firm of Fugard & Knapp, already recognized for their work in visually-elegant  buildings designed in eclectic historic revival styles. During the late 1910s and 1920s, architects  John Reed Fugard (1886-1968) and George Arnold Knapp (1888-1954) designed several  large-scale luxury apartment buildings on Chicago‘s Gold Coast, including twin Italian Renais- sance Revival-style apartment buildings at 60 and 70 E. Scott St. (built 1917-1918), as well as  buildings located within the East Lake Shore Drive Chicago Landmark District―the Classical  Revival-style ―Shoreland Apartments‖ at 229 E. Lake Shore Dr. (1919); the Georgian Revival- style 219 E. Lake Shore Dr. (1922), and the Adamesque-influenced apartment building at 181  E. Lake Shore Dr. (1924). Fugard & Knapp also served as associate architects for the Allerton  Hotel at 701 N. Michigan Av. (1924), a designated Chicago Landmark, and in that role super- vised construction of the building in accordance with the design provided by the New York ar- chitecture firm of Murgatroyd & Ogden.       Characterized by its Classical Revival-style design and finely detailed, light cream-colored  glazed terra cotta ornamentation, the four-story Emerman Building was completed in October  1921.  Promotional materials touted the building‘s ―fire-proof‖ construction and proclaimed it a  ―beautiful structure representing the last word in architecture.‖ Prospective tenants were also   7   The Mutual Insurance  Building is designed in  the Classical Revival  style.

In September 2017, Department of Water Management crews will begin the work to install 1,283  feet of new 8-inch water main in S Evans Ave from E 61st St to E 63rd St and 655 feet of new 8-inch  water main in S Langley Ave from E 62nd St to E 63rd St.  The old water main dates back to 1906,  and needs to be replaced.     If  you  would  like  to  receive  regular  email  updates  about  the  progress  of  the  project,  please  go  to  BuildingANewChicago.org  to  register  for  the  WaterALERT  program.    Simply  enter  your  name,  email address and the project identification number at the top of this letter.    By  signing  up  for  the  WaterALERT  emails,  you  will  be  notified  as  the  project  enters  each  new  construction  phase  –  from  our mobilization of  equipment  onto  the site,  to  the  installation of  new  pipes, to the final restoration of the street.    When we are working in the street, we may close or limit it to traffic for safety reasons, but you will  always be able to reach your home or business.  Outside of working hours, a travel lane will be left  open for local traffic only.     We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed during work hours (generally 7am-4pm).   Parking outside of those hours will be allowed, but cars will need to be moved by the start of the  next workday.  We will try to preserve as much parking space as possible.    We  know  that  construction  always  involves  inconveniences  and  noise.  We  will  do  everything  possible  to  maintain  your  quality  of  life  throughout  these  projects,  and  conducting  ourselves  as  good and thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     Should you have any questions or concerns, you can either ask the construction foreman during the  project, or call any of the following numbers:       24-Hour City Service and Information Line:  311    20th Ward Office:  773-955-5610    DWM Office of Public Affairs:  312-744-6635      When we switch over the services from the old main to the new water main, we will interrupt water  service.  We give you 24-hour notice when this is to happen.  However, in the event of an emergency  shutdown during construction, we may not be able to give you prior warning.    Flushing after Your Service Line has been Connected to the New Water Main     Now that your old water main has been replaced and your water service has been connected to the  new water main, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including  any lead to maintain water quality.      Sediment, rust and metals, including any lead may collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of  your faucets.  These screens should be removed prior to flushing.   3   2      (1) Please find the closest available tap (an outside  hose  spigot,  laundry  sink  faucet  or  bathtub)  to  where  the  water  comes  into  the  home  that  is  not  used for drinking water. Fully open the cold water  tap  and  let  the  water  run  for  at  least  5  minutes.   Next  flush  any  other  cold  water  faucets  on  that  floor for at least 5 minutes.   (2) Move to the next highest floor and repeat.  (3) Move to additional floors in sequence and flush          any taps or faucets for at least 5 minutes.          1     If you have any questions or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190 or  call  311.    For  additional  advice  and  information  visit  http://www.epa.gov/il/advice-chicago- residents-about-lead-drinking-water.    Routine Flushing  If your water line has been idle or stagnant for more than 6-hours, it is advised that you flush for at  least 5 minutes to maintain water quality.  This may include flushing the toilet, taking a shower and  doing laundry.      MeterSave  Lastly, if you don’t already have one, I ask you to consider the installation of a water meter in your  home to help you save money on your water bill.   For more information on this free program, go to  www.metersave.org.    Thank  you  in  advance  for  your  patience  and  cooperation  during  this  important  infrastructure  improvement project.          Sincerely,    Randy Conner  Commissioner   Flushing Your Water Line Your water system has just been connected to a new water main. To flush your water line, locate the closest available tap to where the water comes into the home, like an outside hose faucet, laundry sink or bathtub.

City of Chicago Department of Public Health  www.CityofChicago.org/Health          @ChiPublicHealth            Report on Chicago Health Reforms   August 2012   Report on Chicago Health Reforms   C H I C A G O ’ S   H E A L T H   S E R V I C E S   M O V I N G   I N   T H E   R I G H T   D I R E C T I O N      OVERVIEW   In the first six months of 2012 the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) implemented important health reforms that  have since, improved the quality of services provided to Chicago residents. With substantial and much-needed changes to the  way CDPH offers primary care and mental health services, partnerships with community providers across the city are stronger.  More importantly, residents now have improved access to care and quality of care. These changes not only improved service  delivery but have also saved millions of taxpayer dollars this year and additional savings in the coming years.  CDPH went  from supporting a $20 million system to provide primary and other health services such as mammography, to saving more than  $10 million this year, and will continue to save through 2014 until the benefits of affordable care begin.  In addition, reforms  to mental health services have saved the taxpayers $2M in 2012 and will save another $500,000 in 2013 while expanding  access to care. This report describes the changes and the progress that has been made.   Community Health     CDPH operated 7 neighborhood health centers that provided services to 29,000 uninsured and underinsured patients. In  2011, the department worked with the Neighborhood Health Center Board of Directions to develop a plan to transition these  services to community providers. The goal was to continue to provide services to all clients- with the same out of pocket co- pays- in their same communities while achieving around $10 million in savings.     CDPH is investing $4.7 million to cover the cost of uninsured patients, so they can continue to receive services without  interruption through Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). We will revisit this in 2014 pending the implementation of  the Affordable Care Act.    We issued a competitive RFP for the selection of FQHCs to provide health services to the communities currently being served  by the City’s 7 neighborhood health centers. Awards were issued to Erie Family Health Center, Mercy Family Health, Circle  Family Health Center, Heartland International Health Center, Mile Square Health Service Corporation, Chicago Family Health  Center and Aunt Martha's Youth Service Center.    As a result, residents are already receiving improved quality primary health care and additional benefits. FQHC’s offer an  expanded menu of services, extended hours and a network of locations that provide convenient health care services.      Here is what patients at Erie Division Street Health Center are saying:      ""We don't have to wait a lot. Erie helps us schedule appointments so we don’t have to   wait all day to see a doctor or nurse."" Juan R. (former CDPH client)   “The staff members at Erie are so nice and treat us with respect.” Maria S. (former   CDPH client)           Page 1      Report on Chicago Health Reforms   August 2012       After a successful transition, all 7 FQHC’s are now providing a wide array of services to our patients as well as new  individuals. In addition to the services provided by the FQHC’s, CDPH staff is still providing core public health services in 6 of  those locations. CDPH services include mammography, HIV and STI services, Immunization, Family Case Management and WIC  services.    In addition, some of the FQHC’s have also leveraged federal resources for capital improvements to enhance patient  experiences at existing City facilities, such as improvements made by Heartland International Health Center at the Uptown  location and by Erie Family Health Center at the West Town Clinic. We know that these improvements are just the beginning.   “While Erie has been serving the West Town and Humboldt Park communities for   more than 50 years, the new Erie Division Street Health Center represents an exciting  opportunity to reach more patients and strengthen our partnerships with community  organizations that promote the health and wellness of the residents we all serve,” said  Lee Francis, MD, MPH, President and CEO, Erie Family Health Center.   Mental Health     In 2011, CDPH recognized the need to make changes to its mental health services and overall services city-wide.  Important  services were lacking, our staff was spread thin over 12 mental health centers, which made it difficult to provide consistent  care to our clients.       We also recognized the need to sustain services to those who are uninsured, with the understanding  that clients with insurance have more options. We sat down with community mental health providers  and advocacy groups to design a plan that would further support mental health services across  Chicago.       As a result, we made significant reforms to the way we offer and support mental health services in Chicago by making  improvements to our own system and by investing $3.5 million in community mental health providers. These reforms improved  access to care and resulted in increasing our capacity to serve more residents with mental illness.  While the goal of the mental  health reforms was about expanding patient care through a greater network of providers, the City also realized a savings of  $2 million in 2012.   The Need for Reforms |Mental Health   The reforms focus on serving the uninsured and strengthening the city-wide mental health system to better address the needs of  all who depend on mental health services.  The plan called for the consolidation of the City’s mental health centers (from 12 to  6), preserved capacity to serve 4,000 clients a year, and expanded the mental health network by working with more than 60  community mental health providers to serve approximately 400 of CDPH’s existing insured clients.     ""I was nervous about what was going to happen, but the first contact was good     and Thresholds seemed to be really sincere. I do like the new psychiatrist, because he  seems to listen. I like having people visit me-people didn't really do that before.""   -Thresholds Member (former CDPH client)    thoughtful and courteous. I was satisfied and the transition [from the City clinic to  Thresholds' care] was smooth."" –Thresholds Member (former CDPH client)   ""My experience with Thresholds has been very positive and the staff is both      Page 2         Report on Chicago Health Reforms   August 2012   Transition of Clients |Mental Health   In November of 2011, CDPH initiated the implementation of its transition plan to ensure every individual receiving care from  CDPH continued to have access to care without interruption. Every CDPH client transferring to a new facility, service provider,  or therapist, developed an individual transition plan in consultation with their therapist. The following steps were taken by each  CDPH therapist:     Therapists met with their clients individually to discuss their treatment plan, consulted on where they will continue to receive   services and what type of services would be provided.     Therapists scheduled the 1st appointment for their client at the new service location and transferred all case files.     To assist with travel expenses during the transition, CTA 1-day bus/train passes were made available to clients.      To further support the transition and to ensure continuity of care, CDPH dedicated additional personnel to form a Quality  Team to monitor clients for at least 60 days after their transition. The team is made up of four clinical staff and one consumer  advocate staff. The team does the following:     monitors all clients changing facilities to ensure they arrive to their first appointment and meet with their therapist at the   new location;     monitors the transition process to ensure clients continue their care;      ensures clients changing locations receive transportation assistance during the transition;     contacts clients not meeting their first appointments and helps them reconnect to a mental health service provider.      Transition Update |Mental Health   Total number of individuals served by CDPH Before the consolidations: 2,798    Total number individuals remaining with CDPH for care: 2,369 (85%)    CDPH already saw 301 additional new clients since the transition was completed.    Total number of individuals transferring care outside of CDPH to a community provider:  429 (15%)     97% of them, or 418 patients have an appointment scheduled and 355 (85%) have already attended their first        appointment with the new provider.  If the transition is not working for the client, they are welcomed back to a CDPH clinic for care. So far 54 (12%) clients out  of the 429 that transitioned to community providers have come back to CDPH.      By partnering with Community Mental health providers, we have successfully transitioned clients to providers in their  communities. Every one of the clients we transitioned is insured.  Many of these providers offer expanded wrap around  services. All clients have individual transition plans and are monitored to ensure they are receiving care, they are making it to  their first appointments and they are getting their medications. We are following up with these clients to make sure they are  satisfied with their care.

As a result, we were able to see 326 new clients in our clinics since   May.

Psychiatric Hospitalizations |Mental Health   While psychiatric hospitalizations are not uncommon, especially when people with mental illness experience life changes,   the total number of hospitalizations in CDPH’s system of care has actually maintained relatively stable during the  transition.   While the goal is always to try to maintain individuals in an outpatient setting free of hospitalizations,  psychiatric hospitalizations are not uncommon for mental health providers such as CDPH.  We believe this is a positive  outcome thus far but will continue monitor psychiatric hospitalizations.

This is part of our approach to renewing our  city’s aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part  of this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should  know where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 1,960 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Leamington Street, from  W. Fulton Street to W. Washington Boulevard, and in W. Fulton Street, from N. Laramie  Avenue to N. LeClaire Avenue. The old pipe dates back to 1899, and needs to be replaced.    We are coordinating with Alderman Ervin’s office, and he has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1021 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).     Sincerely,   Thomas Powers  Commissioner     cc:   Alderman Jason Ervin                     28th Ward    1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1      Do you wonder what was happening in 1899? That’s the year the old water main was  installed beneath your street. Among other things:                           ALFRED HITCHCOCK        The pain reliever acetylsalicylic acid was named “aspirin” and sold by Bayer   around the world.     The first auto repair shop opened in Boston.    The Gideon Society was established to place Bibles in hotels.    Carnation processed its first can of evaporated milk.    Voting machines were approved by the U.S. Congress for use in federal elections.    The Bronx Zoo opened in New York.    Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock was born.                LEAMINGTON/FULTON WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 1,960 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Leamington Street, from W. Fulton Street to W. Washington Boulevard, and in  W. Fulton Street, from N. Laramie Avenue to N. LeClaire Avenue.      Reason:  The old main consists of 6-inch pipe, and we want to expand capacity. Further, the old  pipe dates back to 1899 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed by late December 2012. Restoration will be completed in late May 2013. Dates may  change depending on weather and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify  you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on Leamington and Fulton outside of our working hours.   When we are working in the street, we have to close it to traffic for reasons of safety. You will  always be able to reach your home or business, even if it means putting a metal plate in place.   Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours. We are  agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be moved by the start  of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN JASON ERVIN   773-533-0900   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1021                                                    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS               What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1021.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late December  2012.  Restoration will conclude in late May 2013. We always hesitate to promise specific dates,  since we are at the mercy of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.                Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit   Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1            When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.

The financial statements presented to present only the Special Service Area Number 56, and  do  not  purport  to,  and  do  not  present  fairly  the  financial  position  of  Quad  Communities  Development  Corporation,  as  of  December  31,  2015  and  the  changes  in  the  financial  position for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted  in the United States of America.   Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements   Management  is  responsible  for  the  presentation  and  fair  presentation  of  these  financial  statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  of  America;  this  includes  the  design,  implementation,  and  maintenance  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  financial  statements  that  are  free  from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.   Auditor’s Responsibility   Our  responsibility  is  to  express  opinions  on  these  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  from  material  misstatement.   An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  entity’s  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the  entity’s  internal  control.  Accordingly,  we  express  no  such  opinion.  An  audit  also  includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  significant  accounting  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation of the financial statements.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our audit opinions.   -1-  Opinions  In  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects, the financial position of Special Service Area Number 56 as of December 31, 2015,  and the respective changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance with  accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.    Other Matters  Required Supplementary Information    Accounting  principle  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires  that  the  statement of revenues and expenditures-budget and actual on pages 9 to 11 be presented to  supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not part of the basic  financial  statements,  is  required  by  the  Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board  who  considers  it  to  be  an  essential  part  of  financial  reporting  for  placing  the  basic  financial  statements  in  an  appropriate  operational,  economic,  or  historical  context.  We  have  applied  certain  limited  procedures  to  the  required  supplementary  information  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America,  which  consisted  of  inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the  information  for  consistency  with  management’s  responses  to  our  inquiries,  the  basic  financial  statements,  and  other  knowledge  we  obtained  during  our  audit  of  the  basic  financial  statements.  We  do  not  express  an  opinion  or  provide  any  assurance  on  the  information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient to evidence to  express an opinion or provide any assurance.    Other Information    Our audit was conducted for the purpose if forming opinions on the financial statements that  collectively  comprise  the  SSA’s  basic  financial  statements.  The  summary  schedule  of  findings  is  presented  for  purposes  of  additional  analysis  and  is  not  a  required  part  of  the  basis financial statements.    The  summary  schedule  of  findings  is  the  responsibility  of  management  and  was  derived  from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the  basic financial statements. Such information has  been subjected to the  auditing procedures  applied  in  the  audit  of  the  basic  financial  statements  and  certain  additional  procedures,  including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting  and  other  records  used  to  prepare  the  basic  financial  statements  or  to  the  basic  financial  statements  themselves,  and  other  additional  procedures  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the summary  schedule of findings is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial  statements as a whole.    The summary schedule of findings has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied  in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion  or provide any assurance on it.

Furthermore,  committed fund balance is reduced first, followed by assigned amounts, and then unassigned  amounts  when  expenditures  are  incurred  for  purposes  for  which  amounts  in  any  of  those  unrestricted fund balance classifications can be used.    For the government-wide financial statements, net position is reported as invested in capital  assets net of related debt, restricted or unrestricted. Invested in capital assets, net of related  debt,  if  applicable,  is  comprised  of  the  net  capital  asset  balance  less  any  related  debt.  Restricted  net  position  is  when  restrictions  are  placed  on  net  assets  from  1)  externally  imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments or  2) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. The remaining  net position is classified as unrestricted.      Note 2 - Cash and Cash Equivalents      Cash and cash equivalents are subject to custodial credit risk in the event of a bank failure,  the SSA’s deposit may not be returned. The SSA maintains its cash in bank deposit, at times,  may exceed FDIC insured limits.  The amount of cash that exceed FDIC insured limits is $0  as of December 31, 2015.    Note 3 - Property Taxes      Property taxes become an enforceable lien on the real property on January 1 of the year it is  levied. Taxes are payable in two installments in the subsequent year. The first installment is  an  estimate  based  on  the  prior  year  billed  levy  (55%)  and  is  due  in  March.  The  second  installment  is  due  on  August  1,  or  30  days  from  the  mailing  of  the  tax  bills  if  issued  later  than  July  1.  The  second  installment  is  based  on  the  remaining  amount  of  the  levy  on  file  with the County. Bills are issued and collected by Cook County who remits the SSA’s share  to the City who then remits the monies to the SSA.                                                                                         -7-   SPECIAL SERVICE AREA NUMBER 56   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      (Continued)      YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015     Note 4 - Related Party Transactions      SSA is affiliate with Quad Communities Development Corporation, which provides certain  administrative services for SSA.

Burnham, in his seminal 1909 Plan  of Chicago, called for the creation of a series  of islands stretching between Grant and Jackson Parks and extending into Lake Michigan. Northerly Island was the only one to be developed. In 1933 and 1934, the island was expanded to accommo- date part of the grounds for the World’s Fair.  “A Century of Progress” included tall, futuristic buildings made of what were then unconventional materials like plywood and masonite. (AIA Guide  to Chicago, edited by Alice Sinkevitch.) In 1938, the bridge that connected the island was replaced with fill, creating a causeway that now makes the site a peninsula rather than an island. Beginning in 1947, and through the rest of the 20th century, Northerly Island was home to Merrill C. Meigs Field, a small airport. The airport's 50-year lease expired in 1996, and in 2003, the airport was closed. (Chicago Park District web site, 2004.)  In 2004, Northerly Island began its transformation back into parkland. Its design is still being worked out, but it's likely the site will retain an environ- mental focus as plans evolve. Twenty-four acres have already been drill-seeded with native prairie grasses and flowers.  Though this is an urban preserve with spectacular views of the city skyline, the landscape has the feel and function of a wide open grassland.  Even when Meigs Field was functioning as  an airport, birders relied on Northerly Island as  a place to find snowy owls in winter. Short-eared owls, horned larks, and snow buntings can also  be found here, according to Birder's Guide to  the Chicago Region. (Lynne Carpenter and Joel Greenberg, Northern Illinois Press, 1999.) American kestrels are present throughout the  year, and killdeer are here in the summer.

This is part of our approach to renewing our city’s  aging infrastructure. I see this as an opportunity to partner with you our customers. As part of  this partnership, I want to be certain you are well informed about the project. You should know  where to call if you have any questions or concerns.     Our crews will soon be installing 2,443 feet of 8-inch water main in N. Manor Avenue, from W.  Lawrence Avenue to W. Leland Avenue, W. Giddings Street, from N. Manor Avenue to N.  Branch Chicago River, and W. Leland Avenue, from N. Sacramento Avenue to N. Branch  Chicago River. The old pipe dates back to 1909, and needs to be replaced.     We are coordinating with Alderman Mell’s office, and she has made clear we are to put great  importance on your convenience and the quality of life in this neighborhood through the whole  term of this project. Good communication is the key.     I have asked my staff to assemble the attached information for you and to monitor the project  closely. We know that construction always involves inconveniences and noise. We will do  everything possible to minimize inconvenience and noise and to conduct ourselves as good and  thoughtful neighbors in the course of our presence on your street.     If you have questions or comments about the project, please feel free to contact Assistant  Commissioner Tom LaPorte at 312-742-1029 at any time, you may leave a message.     I am also asking you to consider the enclosed information about our MeterSave Program and our  Basement Flooding Partnership (BFP).

That’s the year the old water main was installed  beneath your street.  Among other things:                       The first U.S. university school of nursing was established, at the University of   Minnesota.     Joan of Arc was declared a saint.    The first Lincoln head pennies were minted.    The Indianapolis 500 race track opened.    Actor Errol Flynn was born.    Workers began pouring concrete for the Panama Canal.    The first subway car with side doors went into service in New York City.

WATER PROJECT          PROJECT DESCRIPTION     Project:  The Department of Water Management will soon be installing 2,443 feet of 8-inch  water main in N. Manor Avenue, from W. Lawrence Avenue to W. Leland Avenue, W. Giddings  Street, from N. Manor Avenue to N. Branch Chicago River, and W. Leland Avenue, from N.  Sacramento Avenue to N. Branch Chicago River.    Reason:  The old pipe dates back to 1909 and needs to be replaced.      Timing:  We will begin installing the new water main shortly, and expect the work to be  completed in late July 2014. This includes restoration. Dates may change depending on weather  and other factors. If there is any appreciable change, we will notify you.    Traffic: We will allow traffic to flow on N. Manor Avenue, W. Giddings Street, and W. Leland  Avenue outside of our working hours.  When we are working in the street, we have to close it to  traffic for reasons of safety. You will always be able to reach your home or business, even if it  means putting a metal plate in place.  Outside of working hours, a lane will be left open for local  traffic only.     Parking: We will post our work area for “No Parking” as needed, during work hours (7am- 4pm). We are agreeable to parking outside of those hours, but will have to insist that cars be  moved by the start of the next workday. We will try to preserve as much parking as we can.     CONTACT NUMBERS   24-HOUR SERVICE AND INFORMATION LINE      3-1-1   ALDERMAN DEBORAH MELL   773-478-8040   ASSISTANT WATER MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER TOM LAPORTE   312-742-1029                                                  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             What if there is a problem?  There are always surprises in any construction project.  If you  have any concerns or questions, you can ask our foreman in the street.  You can also call  Assistant Commissioner Tom LaPorte directly at 312-742-1029.  His cell is on the voicemail  message, in case it’s off hours.    Can I park when you’re not working? We have no problem with you parking outside of our  working hours.  We have to insist that cars be out of our way at the start of the workday.     Will this ever end?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, the job is slated to conclude in late July 2014.  This includes restoration. We always hesitate to promise specific dates, since we are at the mercy  of other factors like weather and emergencies elsewhere in town.    Will you shut my water off? Yes, maybe a couple of times. When we switch over the services  from the old main to the new main, we interrupt service. We give you 24-hour notice when this  is to happen.  In any construction project, there is also a risk that an old pipe will break.  They  can be fragile. This may necessitate an emergency shutdown.  If we do this, we will let you know  what is happening, even though we may be unable to give prior warning.    Why should I be nice about this?  The crew working in the street will work hard to be good  neighbors, and to respect both your convenience and your quality-of-life.  By working together,  we can complete this important project as friends working for the improvement of our  community.    After your old water main has been replaced and you have been connected to your new water  main, please open all your water faucets and hose taps and flush your water for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sediment and metals can collect in the aerator screen located at the tip of your faucets. These  screens should be removed prior to flushing. This flushing will help maintain optimum water  quality by removing sediment, rust, or any lead particulates that may have come loose from your  property’s water service line as a result of the water main replacement. If you have any questions  or concerns about your water quality, please call us at 312-744-8190.               DOES YOUR BASEMENT FLOOD?     The Department of Water Management would like to work with you and your neighbors to  reduce the risk of basement flooding.  We are promoting a collective response as the only  strategy—homeowners joining together on a neighborhood basis to work with us on  practical steps (public and private) to protect your property and peace of mind.

MeterSave is a program to encourage Chicago homeowners to voluntarily install meters to  monitor water usage. Meters allow single family and two-flat homeowners to pay for only the  water actually used, encouraging efforts to save water and money while protecting one of our  most precious natural resources.    Water charges in non-metered homes are tied to factors such as building size, lot-size and  number of plumbing fixtures. Metered homes are billed according to actual use. This means that  with minimal effort, participating homeowners could save money on their water bills.      Homeowner Incentives   Non-metered homeowners participating in MeterSave are eligible for the following:    A 7-year guarantee that the home water bill will be no higher than it would have if the meter   had not been installed. Bill will not exceed the assessed rate for that year.     Choice of one of the following (while supplies last):   rain barrel,        water meter monitor (a refrigerator magnet that shows water usage)    outdoor water conservation kit or      And, two of the above incentives if a whole block volunteers!   indoor water conservation kit      Frequently Asked Questions:   How and when do I sign up?   Interested non-metered single family and two-flat homeowners may visit www.metersave.org,  call 311, or call 312-744-4H2O. Please have your 12-digit account number ready.  Space is  limited based on funding availability and the number of volunteers.     What will it cost to participate?  The City of Chicago Department of Water Management will install a water meter complete with  the automatic meter reading (AMR) technology in your home FREE of charge.    AMR technology allows readings to be transmitted via wireless radio technology to Water  Management vehicles as they drive by, eliminating the need for readings to take place inside the  home.  Bills will be issued bi-monthly and reflect only the actual amount of water used.     Do I have to be current on my water bill?  Yes.  Homeowners must be current on payment plan and water bill to participate in this limited  time offer of a 7-year guarantee.    For payment plan information call 312-744-4H20 (4426).      1 0 0 0   E A S T   O H I O   S T R E E T ,   C H I C A G O ,   I L L I N O I S     6 0 6 1 1           When can I have a meter installed?  Online meter installation scheduling is available at www.metersave.org  Otherwise, Water  Management will contact you to schedule a time for meter installation.      Small changes made by Chicagoans can have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of  our water supply, such as:     Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.  This can save over 500 gallons  per month per person.    Install high-efficiency, low-flow toilets.  Toilets alone consume 26% of household water  consumption.  A leaky toilet wastes 200 gallons of water per day.    Install high-efficiency washing machines. This can save energy and water consumption.    Fill the sink with dishwater instead of washing dishes with an open tap.  This saves 25  gallons per wash.    If you own a dishwasher, wait until you have a full load to run it.  Dishwashers typically  use half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than washing dishes in the sink.    Garden with plants that are native to Chicago.  This can reduce outdoor water use by 20- 50%.    Use rain barrels to capture rainwater for watering lawns and gardens.    Use a timer or a rain sensor to monitor lawn irrigation: Sprinkler systems use thousands  of gallons of water per cycle.  Installing a timer or rain sensor will save money and water by  preventing needless watering.         WATER   Our Most Precious Resource   Lake Michigan has lost almost 32 trillion gallons of water--the equivalent of over 45 million  Olympic-sized swimming pools of water-- over the past decade. Our region could face severe  water shortages by 2050 if we fail to take decisive action.     More than half of water consumption in Chicago occurs within homes.   Over 5.4 million people-- 44% of the population of the State of Illinois, depend on the Chicago  Department of Water Management to provide a reliable supply of drinking water from Lake  Michigan.
