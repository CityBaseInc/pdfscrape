Friedman fit Company was engaged by the City ofChicago  (the  ""City"")  to  conduct  a  Tax  Increment  Financing  EUgibffity  Study  and  prepare  a  Redevelopment  Plan and Project  (the ""Redevelopment  Plan"").  This report details  the  eUgibility  factors  found  within  the  Central  West  Redevelopment  Project  Area  (the  ""R.P.A."") Tax Increment  Financing  (""T.I.F."")  District in support  ofits  designation  as   2 / 1 6 / 2 0 00   REPORTS  OF  COMMITTEES   2 5 2 81   a  ""conservation  area"" within  the  definitions  set  forth  in  the  Illinois Tax  Increment  Allocation Redevelopment Act, 65 ILCS 5/11-74.4-1, et seq., as amended  (the ""Act"").  This  report  also  contains  the  Redevelopment  Plan  and  Project  for the  Central  West  R.P.A.   The Central West R.P.A. is located within  the near west  side community  area  and  consists  of two thousand  ninety-four  (2,094)  tax parcels  on  one  hundred  ten  (110)  blocks  and  contains  approximately  four  hundred  sixty-three  (463)  acres  of  land.   Determination  Of  EligibUity.   This report concludes that the Central West R.P.A. is eligible for T.I.F.  designation  as a ""conservation  area"" because fifty percent  (50%) or more ofthe  structures  in  the  area have an age of thirty-five  (35) years or more and because the foUowing eligibiUty  factors  have  been  found  to be  present  to  a  major  extent:   depreciation  of physical  maintenance;   deterioration;   structures  below minimum  code;   inadequate  utilities;  and   deleterious  land-use  or  layout.   Additionally,  two  (2)  other  eligibUity  factors  are  present  to  a  minor  extent  and  demonstrate  that  the  Central  West  R.P.A.  is  in  a  state  of gradual  decUne  through  disinvestment.  Left unchecked,  these conditions could accelerate  the decline  ofthe  community  and,  combined  with  those  factors  that  have  been  documented  to  be  present  intensive  disinvestment.  These  factors  are:   to  a  major  extent,  could   lead   to  more  widespread  and   obsolescence;  and   excessive  vacancies.   25322   JOURNAL-CITYCOUNCIL-CHICAGO   2 / 1 6 / 2 0 00   Redevelopment  Plan  by  replacingjthe  1998  E.A.V.  with  the  1999  E.A.V.  without  further  City Council  action.   Anticipated  Equalized  Assessed  yaluation.   By  2023,  the  E.A.V.  for  the  Central  West  R.P.A.  wUI  be  approximately  Two  Hundred  One  Million  Four  Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($201,400,000).  This  estimate is based on several key assumptions, including:  1) an inflation  factor of two  percent  (2%) peryear  on the  E.A.V; of all properties  within  the  Central West  R.P.A.,  with  its  cumulative  impact  occurring  in  each  triennial  reassessment  year;  2)  an  equalization  factor  of  2.1799;  and  3)  a  tax  rate  of  8.872%  for  the  duration  of  the  Central  West  R.P.A.   Required  [Findings  And  Tests.   Lack  Of  Growth  And  Private  Investment.   The  City  is  required  to  evaluate, whether  or  not  the  R.P.A.  has  been  subject  to  growth  and  private  investment  and  must  substantiate  a  finding  of  lack  of  such  investment  prior  to establishing  a  tax  increment  financing  district.   1   First,  while  some  market-based  investment  has  occuned  in  the  Central  West  R.P.A. between  1994 and  1998, this investment  has  been minimal in scope and  not  part  of  any  coordinated  development  strategy.  Much  of  the  growth  in  Equalized  Assessed  Valuation  (""E.A.V."")  during  this  period  of  time  was  limited  to  a  small  number  of high-growth  parcels whose  1998 assessed values were greater than  One  Hundred Thousand  DoUars ($100,000) and whose assessments  grew thirty  percent  (30%)  or more  during  the  study  period.  These  high-growth  parcels  represent  less  than  one  percent  seven-tenths  percent  (.7%)  of  all  parcels  within  the  R.P.A.  and  account  for  approximately  twenty-six  percent  (26%)  ofthe  R.P.A.'s  total  growth  tn  E.A.V.  An  additional  three  percent  (3%)  of  the  parcels  within  the  R.P.A.  grew  in  value as a result of pubUc subsidy.  These properties accounted  for thirteen  percent  (13%) ofthe  total growth  in  E.A.V. during this  period  of time.  Combined,  the  high- growth  and  pubUcaUy subsidized  parcels  have  had  minimal  impact  on  the  taxable  value  of sunounding  properties.  Excluding  these  parcels,  the  compound  annual  growth  rate  of  E.A.V.  in  the  R.P.A.  was  two  and  eighty-eight  hundredths  percent  (2.88%)  between  1994 and  1998.  This is stx percent  (6%) lower than  the three  and  six hundredths  percent  (3.06%)  growth  experienced  by the  City  of Chicago  during   "
